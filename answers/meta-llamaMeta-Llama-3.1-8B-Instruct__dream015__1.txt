set out on a solo journey to explore the remnants of the old world. I've heard rumors of a hidden library, buried beneath the ruins of a great city, where lies the key to rebuilding society. I've been searching for it for weeks, scavenging for supplies and navigating through treacherous terrain.

As I venture deeper into the ruins, I notice that the skies are a sickly yellow color, casting an eerie glow over everything. The air is thick with the stench of smoke and ash, and I can hear the distant rumble of thunder. I've never seen the sun, not since the world ended.

I approach a large, abandoned gas station, its pumps lying on their sides like stalactites. I rummage through the nearby dumpster, pulling out a few cans of expired soup and a battered first-aid kit. I take a swig of the soup, wincing at its unholy taste, and apply some of the antiseptic gel to a gash on my arm.

I make my way to the rear of the station, where a smeared-over door conceals a staircase leading down. I brush aside the rubble and take the stairs, finding myself in a cramped, poorly lit hallway. The walls are covered in peeling paint, and the air is stale and musty.

I push aside the drapes and peer out into a dimly lit room filled with rows of dusty shelves. The air is heavy with the scent of old books. In the center of the room, I spot a massive, stone platform with a shallow cavity beneath it. A wooden ladder leads down into the darkness.

I hesitate for a moment, feeling a shiver run down my spine. This must be the library. But what lies beneath the platform? I take a deep breath, and begin to make my way down into the unknown.

As I climb down the ladder, I bump into a fragile, unlit candle, which topples and sets the air filled with the faint scent of wax. I prod wildly at the darkness around me, searching for a doorway. Suddenly, a gust of wind stirs, avocaiously lifting the candle wick to eager fortune and then drops into the empty place flickering wildly. Then with voice filled desperation I holler :
