…where the conversations drift in directions I don’t understand clearly. The room vibrates with laughter, but it’s all layered and distant. Among the clapping dunces, footsteps echo toward a figure who sits quietly, shrouded in shadows. The air smells faintly of smoke and memory. I wonder—do they recognize me, or do they unaware of how they may come to greet me in this place?

As I lean closer, I notice faint traces of something unusual behind them—words scribbled in invisible ink. The question lingers: is this a place where memories are exchanged, where secrets are traded without words? Or perhaps… a place where people simply come to look for me?

I decide to follow the scent of the ink first, because the real mystery isn’t who I am, but who might be waiting for me behind the curtain.
