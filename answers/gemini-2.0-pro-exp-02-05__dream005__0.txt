... overhear snippets of their truly bizarre conversations.

First, I brush past a cluster of people dressed in what appears to be Victorian-era mourning clothes, complete with black veils and tiny, ornate birdcages strapped to their wrists. One woman, her voice a dramatic whisper, says, "...and then, the squirrel simply *refused* to wear the monocle. Said it clashed with his fur." Another, dabbing at her (presumably) tear-stained eyes with a lace handkerchief, replies, "Honestly, Margaret, some creatures just have no sense of occasion. Remember Bartholomew the Badger's disastrous debut at the Cucumber Sandwich Summit?" They all nod solemnly, the tiny birds in their cages chirping a mournful tune.

I quickly move on, my head already spinning. I next stumble upon a circle of individuals who are all staring intently at a single, perfectly ripe avocado sitting on a pedestal in the center of the room. One man, wearing a lab coat and thick glasses, is holding a tuning fork to the avocado. He hums deeply, then exclaims, "The resonant frequency is… slightly off! We need more… magenta!" A woman in a sequined jumpsuit rushes forward with a can of magenta spray paint, but another person, dressed entirely in camouflage gear, stops her. "No, no! It must be *organic* magenta! Derived from the tears of a left-handed flamingo!" The group erupts in a heated debate about the ethical sourcing of flamingo tears.

Feeling increasingly disoriented, I push through a thick velvet curtain and find myself facing a group dressed as… vegetables. There's a giant, smiling carrot, a glum-looking broccoli floret, a surprisingly seductive tomato, and a very nervous-looking potato. The carrot is booming, "…and that, my friends, is why root vegetables are inherently superior! We are grounded! We are earthy! We are…" The broccoli interrupts, muttering, "We're also mostly water and get mushy when overcooked." The tomato winks at me (somehow, without eyelids) and purrs, "Don't listen to him, darling. We're the juicy ones. The *flavor*." The potato, meanwhile, is quietly trying to edge away, whispering, "I just want to be mashed… with butter… and maybe some chives…"

Suddenly, a hand touches my arm. I turn, hoping it's the one person I know, but instead, it's a man wearing a full suit of armor, but with a fluffy pink bunny slipper on one foot. He leans in close, his voice muffled by the helmet, and says, "Psst... have you seen the sentient cheese grater? It's escaped again, and last I saw it, it was heading towards the existential dread discussion group..."

I close my eyes, take a deep breath, and whisper back to the knight. "Have you checked if it followed the smell of parmesan?"

He pauses and whispers, "... you might be onto something..." and he dashes in the opposite direction. Then, I hear it, a faint voice, a familiar voice. I start running, and I...
