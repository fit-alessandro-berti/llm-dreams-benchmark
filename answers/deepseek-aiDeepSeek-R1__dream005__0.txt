**Dream Continuation:**

As you weave through the murmuring crowd, each group seems to morph into a vignette of surreal symbolism. A circle of strangers laughs in perfect unison, their faces flickering like candle flames. Another cluster stands frozen mid-gesture, trapped in a pocket of stopped time, their champagne flutes suspended in crystalline arcs. You catch fragments of conversations that dissolve into riddles—*"The moon is a key,"* someone whispers—before the room itself shifts, walls bending like taffy, elongating the hallway ahead.  

A figure in the distance mirrors the person you’re seeking—same posture, same scarf—but when you draw closer, their features blur like wet ink. Panic hums in your veins. You turn a corner and stumble into a silent ballroom where guests waltz without music, their feet gliding inches above the floor. Among them, you finally spot your friend. Relief floods you… until they turn. Their eyes are voids, galaxies swirling in the depths.  

*"You’re late,"* they say, voice echoing from all directions. When you reach out to touch their sleeve, your hand passes through them like smoke. The room unravels into a storm of confetti and static, and you wake with a gasp, the taste of stardust still on your tongue.
