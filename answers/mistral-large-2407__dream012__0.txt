...see a massive wave approaching, its crest foaming and menacing. The ship groans and creaks as it's tossed about like a toy. You grip the wheel tightly, your knuckles white, and bellow out orders to your crew.

"Secure the rigging! Batten down the hatches! We need to turn into the wave!"

Your crew, though frightened, springs into action. They scramble across the deck, securing ropes and fastening shut every hatch. You spin the wheel, steering the ship directly into the oncoming wave. The ship climbs the watery mountain, its bow pointing skyward.

As you reach the peak, time seems to slow. You look out over the storm, the wind whipping your hair, salt spray stinging your eyes. Then, with a deep breath, you shout, "Hold on!"

The ship tips over the wave's crest and plunges down into the trough. The storm rages on, but you and your crew navigate each wave with skill and determination. Slowly, the storm begins to abate. The waves grow smaller, the wind less fierce.

Finally, a break in the clouds reveals a ray of sunlight. The crew cheers, their faces etched with relief and exhaustion. You've weathered the storm. As you steer the ship towards calmer waters, you know that your crew's trust in you has been well-earned. The dream fades as the sea calms, leaving you with a sense of pride and relief.
