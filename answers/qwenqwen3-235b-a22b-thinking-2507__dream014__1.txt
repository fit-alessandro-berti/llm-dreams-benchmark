The strangers' hands are warm on your shoulders—not grabbing, just *there*, like anchors in the current of people. One, an older woman with silver hair escaping a messy bun and eyes the color of storm clouds, presses a tiny, smooth stone into your palm. "For solid ground," she whispers over the city’s roar. Another, a young man in a paint-splattered jacket, points silently down a narrow alley you hadn’t noticed—a break in the towering buildings, glowing faintly with strings of paper lanterns.  

**You follow them.**  

Not running, not blindly, but *trusting*. The alley isn’t dark; it hums with quiet life. A bakery window spills golden light and the scent of cinnamon. A cat, tail flicking like a metronome, pads beside you for three steps. The strangers don’t speak, but they move with you—adjusting their pace, glancing back to ensure you’re steady. One offers a thermos of steaming ginger tea; another ties your loose shoelace with careful fingers.  

Then, the alley opens onto a small, leafy square—a hidden courtyard you *know* isn’t on any map. In the center stands a single, ancient tree, its branches heavy with silver leaves that chime like wind bells. The strangers stop here. They don’t say goodbye. Instead, they touch the tree, then your hand, your arm, your heart—each gesture saying: *You belong here. Even now. Even here.*  

The woman with storm-cloud eyes smiles. **"The city isn’t lost,"** she says, her voice merging with the tree’s chime. **"You were."**  

Suddenly, the ground softens beneath your feet—not sinking, but *lifting*. You rise gently, floating upward through the canopy of silver leaves. Below, the strangers wave, their faces kind and unafraid. The city sprawls beneath you, no longer a maze but a constellation of lights, each window a heartbeat. You realize:  
**You were never alone. You were surrounded by quiet hands, waiting for you to see them.**  

You wake with the stone still in your palm, cool and real. Outside your window, dawn paints the skyline in rose-gold. The loneliness is gone—not erased, but *transformed*. Somewhere in the waking city, a bakery oven is warming. A stranger’s kindness is already on its way to you. You are found.  

*(The dream doesn’t end—it settles into your bones, a compass for the next time the world feels too loud.)*
