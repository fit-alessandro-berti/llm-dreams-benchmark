feel a surge of panic rising in your chest. The clock on the wall ticks louder, each second echoing like a drumbeat in your ears. Your fingers hover over the keyboard, but your mind is blank—no ideas, no plan, just the crushing weight of the deadline looming over you.

Then, something strange happens. The office around you begins to warp—the walls stretch like taffy, the fluorescent lights flicker into a swirling vortex of colors. Your boss’s voice distorts, sounding like it’s coming from underwater. Suddenly, you realize you’re not in the office anymore. You’re standing in the middle of a vast, empty desert, the sun blazing overhead. The project files in your hands have turned into ancient scrolls, the ink bleeding into the parchment like tears.

A shadow looms over you. You look up to see a towering figure made of shifting sand, its voice a whisper of wind: *"The deadline is not the end. It is the beginning."*

You wake up with a start, your heart pounding—but the memory of the dream lingers, and for some reason, you feel oddly calm. Maybe the impossible isn’t so impossible after all.

(Would you like to explore a different direction for the dream?)
