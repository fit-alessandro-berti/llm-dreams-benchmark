Okay, I'm dreaming...

I'm walking through this forest, the air is cool and smells of pine needles and damp earth. Sunlight filters in warm patches onto the mossy ground. It's utterly peaceful. But then, the light dims unnaturally fast. The air grows heavy, charged with a strange energy. A low rumble starts somewhere far off, like the forest floor is humming a deep, unsettling tune. The trees begin to sway, not gently, but with a sudden, violent shiver through their branches. The peaceful silence is replaced by a rising howl of wind. You feel a storm approaching and...

...the first fat drops of rain hit your face, cold and shocking. Within seconds, the sky opens up. It's not just rain; it's a cascade, a waterfall from the heavens, instantly drenching you to the bone. The wind whips around, tearing at leaves, bending the very trunks of the trees. Lightning cracks nearby, a blinding flash of stark white light that illuminates the thrashing forest for a split second, followed by an ear-splitting, gut-shaking boom of thunder that seems to shake the ground beneath your feet.

Panic, cold and sharp, grips you. You need shelter, *now*. You look around frantically, but the familiar path is gone, swallowed by the grey deluge. The trees blur into a watery wall. Another flash of lightning, closer this time, reveals something unusual – not a cave or a thicket, but a massive, ancient oak tree that seems to pulse with a faint, golden light from within its gnarled bark. Its branches twist into impossibly intricate shapes, forming what looks strangely like an arched doorway, carved by nature or something else entirely.

Compelled by a force beyond logic, you run towards it, splashing through rising puddles, the wind howling in your ears like a lost spirit. You push through the thick, water-slicked branches that guard the opening and step inside.

But it's not hollow, nor is it filled with damp earth. Inside the ancient oak is a space bathed in soft, warm, golden light. The roaring storm outside is completely silenced, muffled into a distant, soothing whisper, like waves far away. The air within is dry and smells faintly of honey and old paper. The walls aren't bark, but smooth, swirling patterns of woodgrain that seem to shift and flow like liquid. Bookshelves carved directly into the wood line the curving walls, filled with volumes bound in leather and fabric you've never seen before. A comfortable armchair sits in the center, beside a small, glowing orb that provides the gentle light. The storm rages on outside, but in here, you are utterly safe, warm, and surrounded by the quiet promise of untold stories and secrets. The urgency of the storm dissolves, replaced by a profound sense of calm and curiosity about this impossible haven.
