You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching—and then, it doesn’t rain.

The sky darkens, but instead of thunder, the trees begin to whisper in a language just beyond understanding. Leaves glow faintly gold, swirling upward like embers, forming spirals that pulse with rhythm, as if the forest itself is breathing. The air hums—not with wind, but with song. A melody only your soul remembers.

Ahead, the path splits into three. One leads to a bridge woven from moonlight and spider silk. Another curves into a tunnel of floating lanterns shaped like eyes. The third… disappears into a pool of liquid starlight, where your reflection isn’t yours anymore. It’s younger. It’s older. It’s smiling through tears you didn’t know you were crying.

A voice—not from anywhere—speaks inside your chest:  
*“Choose what you need to lose… or what you’re ready to become.”*

You step toward the starlit pool. The moment your toes touch the surface, you don’t sink—you rise. Your body unravels into feathers, into light, into a thousand tiny birds that scatter into the canopy. The storm isn’t coming anymore.

It already happened.

And you were the one who changed.

You wake with feathers caught in your hair, the scent of wet earth and jasmine still clinging to your skin—and the quiet, certain knowledge that somewhere, in some dream you’ve already lived, you were never meant to stay human.

The forest remembers you.

And now, you remember it.
