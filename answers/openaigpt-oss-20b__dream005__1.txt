You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and... 

The first group that comes into view is a circle of elderly storytellers. They sit in a circle of mismatched chairs—some leather, some cork, some carved from driftwood. Their voices hum like the low thud of distant drums, and each one murmurs a word that repeats backwards: “night”—“nohty.” They twist the word around their lips, and as they do, the shadows around them shift and elongate in an endless, humming spiral. When you lean closer, their tongues change shape like seashells opening and closing, and you hear the faintest echo of an ancient lullaby that makes the hair on your arms rise.

You’re almost at the edge of the dance floor when a new group arrives—a troupe of ballerinas wearing translucent gowns that shine like a thousand prisms in the flickering alleyway lantern light. They swirl around each other, forming patterns like the galaxy’s arms, each pirouette leaving behind a faint, sweet scent of the ocean and rosemary. Though the ballerinas move as one, each footstep opens a mirror that shows a different version of yourself: tall, slender, laughing, grieving, or floating. You begin to think that you too might be made of reflections—yet, when you try to speak, words simply drift away like feathers in a windstorm.

The next, a gathering of storytellers who tell their tales in unpronounced letters, arrive from the garden of the orchard. Their skin is made of bark that glows faintly green, and every time they carve a word into the bark of their hands, the letters sprout flowers of ink that bloom into wild roses. The letters that whisper to them are not yours but your own memories: your mother’s smile, your grandfather’s thunderous laugh, the taste of honey on a rainy morning. You feel each story as if it's a thread snapping back to its origin—an origin which keeps you searching. 

Now you find yourself walking down a path lined with luminous lanterns, each lantern contains a different animal, but each has the same uncanny gaze. They flicker the way the darkness folds into the light. One of these lanterns catches your eye. Inside it glimmered a small dragon that whispered into your ear: “The one you seek is not out there… It’s woven into every hush of the streets.” The sentence is carved into the lantern’s glass. Though you can't understand the words, you can sense that it might be someone you have yet to learn about, perhaps the love with a smile and a laugh that rings in your ear. 

When you think you have stepped out of the dance floor onto a barren field, you see that this is a dream—surreal, beautiful, terrible—like a circus parade or a kaleidoscope of fireworks played to your heartbeat. Of course, as a dream, there is nothing that can prevent you from wanting to keep walking and exploring, hoping you catch the thread. But the journey will never end because dreams have endless possibilities, and in it you can dance with a beautiful dragon, a group of flamingo dancers and watch them vanish into the twilight moon. The only thing that is not real—something that feels true—is the search. It’s not a thing, but a way to learn this dream is all about.
