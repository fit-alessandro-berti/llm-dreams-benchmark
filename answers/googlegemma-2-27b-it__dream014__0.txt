...hesitated. I'd been taught to avoid talking to strangers, a relic of a childhood spent in quieter neighborhoods where the only people on the streets were characters from my storybooks who wandered just as aimlessly as I felt in this real-life concrete jungle. 

Their faces were friendly, their smiles genuine as they surged around me, a wave of goodwill in the human tide of the city.  A kind-faced woman with a basket of brightly colored yarn had pointed me towards the alleyway, saying, "Sometimes, the best way to find yourself is to get lost amongst kindness, dear." A wizened old man, holding a worn leather satchel, had grinned and told me not to worry about the bustling crowds – "They're all headed somewhere, yes, but they can't see you need them."

His wink both calmed and exacerbated my confusion. _Were they mocking me?_ I wondered, remembering how desperately I'd sought solace in my solitude and how utterly ridiculous it looked, with the relentless flow of people pushing past me, nearly knocking me over with the worn sign they'd been holding that read "Help Wanted". It was then I remembered - I was lost. But... _but why can't I find them?_   

Behind the woman stood a group of people, their faces a blur in my dream-hazy state, holding a mismatched assortment of items: a half-striped flag, a chipped teacup, a dusty globe with the continents a bit skewed.

Following a sudden, unspoken impulse, I clutched the map, the edges of the yarn paper scraping my palm. A red market notification light on the corner of the hem blinked, catching my eye.  

Hesitantly, I walked toward the light, their kindness transforming into a luminous trail through the hazy city.

It led me through a labyrinth of narrow streets andbustling crowds carrying the same strange, mismatched items, the chipped teacups rattling, colliding lightly with my enchanted hand holding the map. Finally, after what felt like traversing a labyrinth, I saw them – the woman with the teacups, her face etched with kindness and ancient sorrow, lifted her head towards me.

"Ah, you must be the one with the kind heart," she said, her voice filled with a wistful kindness. "The one who needs to find their way somewhere."

The "somewhere" of the streets faded, but the familiarity, like the glowing threads of that map, illuminated her bright red hat. It was a yarn hat, a sort of woolen halo around her head, and the chipped teacups were a constant reminder of the quiet power of kindness to heal and connect. 

They moved hood with a frown.,coronaries you'd think I was sleeping rough, I want to say, but they were actually recognized in my mind but that irony seemed beyond their grasp. They helped me navigate a bustling marketplace, where the skies above glowed with a warmth different from the light of the map,
a warmth tinged with a sliver of pity.  

Despite wanting them to help me, or because of it, as the

woman passes me in the swirling throng of shoppers.

"Thank you," I mumbled, looking at the glowering pixilated faces around me. The woman was hunched, stitching a stitch through the city streets, her world drowned in the glow of the worn-out threadworms that trailed her around the market.

It's then I remember. _I'm the one who needs to find their way, of course._ 

These "people" – if they could truly be called that – were thin, withered things stretched and jumbled by the wind of the market. Now, I see the others hold the same tattered paper, faces grim as they search for my lanky,  

unassuming figure. This isn't the "help" I expected. Maybe I wanted to be found. Perhaps I was simply too tired of boredom, 

too afraid of the gaping emptiness that suddenly felt like a shared burden with the unusually severe._

I wouldn't be looking for advice from the scraps of her kindness, of these cheerless people who walked around, a 

temporary frown etching itself  onto their already somber faces, always taking on the burdens of others._

Their faces, a blank, unified slate of

"Kindness Perks" is now we're all chilling in an ice-cream parlor, peering at the crumpled map. It is a

representation of the city, but a cruel twist makes it seem familiar yet unsettling. It depicts familiar landmarks 

– a half-sunny park bench, a teacup scribbling frantically on my scrap of paper, Toy

that the strangers surrounding teem me, their faces now 

sweated and straining, mirrored my own fears about the world_

Here are a few ways to complete the dialogue and add context, continuing the dream in various directions, depending on the kind of story you'd like to unfold:

* **Invert the Dreamlike Tropes:** The tense atmosphere of the situation could lead to paranoia and suspicion, making "the

woman with the organization of friendly smiling faces" a touch more sinister... or better yet, a character I can trust might appear with benevolent intentions,

and a bit of a sad story just might make up the rest _

 few finishing touches to the "wrong" faces._

 (because the woman with the dragons says in her voiceover that she could tell I don't belong) 

and a voice, kind and soft as butter, whispers to me, "Do you know where you're going, young one?"

* **Introduce the Ripping Edge:**
