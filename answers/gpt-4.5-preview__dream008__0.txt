feel the pressure building as you nervously review endless stacks of documents. Each moment passes slowly, yet the clock's hands race faster and faster. Just when your anxiety peaks, you look down and notice that your papers are gently floating upward. Puzzled, you glance around the office and realize the walls have faded away—you stand in an open field under a gentle, lavender sky.

Your boss smiles knowingly and gestures toward a door standing upright in the grass. Carefully, you approach and open it. You're now on a ship sailing calmly across a sparkling sea beneath stars you've never seen before. With each breath, the looming deadline fades, replaced by peaceful curiosity.

As you look above, constellations begin rearranging themselves, forming symbols that hold deep significance for you. Guided by their faint glow, you steer the ship toward a distant shore, feeling confident and certain you already possess everything you'll need to complete the project ahead.

As the ship arrives safely at a welcoming harbor, your boss—now transformed into a supportive friend—reassures you kindly: "You've had the skills and courage required all along. Trust yourself."

You wake up refreshed, filled with clarity and renewed confidence, knowing that you can overcome any challenge ahead.
