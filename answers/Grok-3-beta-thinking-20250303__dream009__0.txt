You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. The world feels raw and untouched, a stark contrast to the life you know. As you blink away the haze of sleep, you find yourself lying on a bed of soft moss beneath a towering canopy of ancient trees. The air is thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, and the faint warmth of sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled shadows across the forest floor. Strange bird calls echo in the distance, mingling with the rustling of leaves stirred by a gentle breeze. 

You sit up, noticing that your familiar clothes are gone, replaced by simple, hand-woven garments—rough against your skin but oddly comforting. There’s no hum of electricity, no distant roar of engines, no glow of screens. The absence of modern technology hits you like a wave, leaving you both disoriented and intrigued.

As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to find food and shelter. Your stomach rumbles, a reminder that survival here won’t come as easily as it once did. You scan the forest, spotting a cluster of bushes laden with dark, unfamiliar berries. Are they safe to eat? You’re not sure, but hunger nudges you to take the risk. Nearby, a faint trickle of water catches your ear—a stream, perhaps, cutting through the woods. Water is a start, you think, a lifeline in this untamed place.

You take your first tentative steps, the ground cool and uneven beneath your bare feet. A mix of fear and curiosity pulses through you. What era is this? Prehistoric? Medieval? Something entirely unknown? There’s no time to dwell on it. You’ll need to learn fast—how to gather, how to build, how to live in a world that doesn’t bend to your will with the press of a button. Ahead, the forest stretches endlessly, hiding both dangers and wonders. With each step, you feel the pull of adventure, a whispered promise that this strange new life is yours to shape.
