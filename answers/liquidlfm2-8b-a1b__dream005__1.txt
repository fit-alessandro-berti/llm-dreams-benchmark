...each encounter feels like a fleeting whisper across a crowded room. You glance through crowds—faces blur and smile, voice and name slipping just beyond reach—while the air hums with laughter and music that fades just as quickly as it comes. At first, the group on the dance floor feels distant, their joy vibrating but unreachable, like sunlight through dust. Then, one person stands at the far edge, wearing a familiar coat with a faint scallop stitching at the cuff—your one. You drift toward them, the sound of their voice cracking like old vinyl, soft and recognizable. Around you, others shift like shadows: one man waves a drink with quiet confidence, another leans in, sharing a secret too tender for strangers, their eyes meeting yours in a silent exchange. You step closer, and when you finally speak their name—“Lena”—the moment hangs, charged and warm. Between you, the noise of the party recedes, not gone, but subtler, as if the world has tilted just enough to hold what matters. And for a breath, you are no longer dreaming—only together.
