You’re staring at the glowing screen of your workstation, heart hammering against your ribs like a trapped bird. Your boss stands over you, arms crossed, watching the clock on the wall with a blank, expectant face. "Finish the report by 3 PM," they said, and now the digital display blinks *2:59:47*—but it’s not ticking down. It’s frozen.  

The project? A *completely blank document* labeled "Global Sustainability Impact Analysis (Due Now)." No body text. No data. Just a cursor blinking in the void. Outside the window, the sky is unnaturally purple, and the office chairs are floating upside-down. Your fingers hover over the keyboard. You try to type, but the keys dissolve into butterflies when they touch.  

Then—*you remember*. This isn’t real. You *never* got this project. The deadline was a nightmare stitch, woven from last week’s overwork and a childhood fear of disappointing teachers. The boss? Actually your third-grade art teacher, Ms. Gable, who once made you redo a paper cutout for 20 minutes straight.  

You close your eyes. When you open them again, the screen is a soft, blank page—no timer, no pressure. Just a single line of text, written in your own hand: *"You’re safe. This was never yours to hold."*  

You wake up instantly. Sunlight streams through your bedroom window. The alarm clock reads 7:03 AM. Your phone buzzes: a text from a colleague. *"Hey, free internal workshop at 10! No prep needed—just show up."* You smile, breathe deep, and roll over. For the first time in weeks, the weight is gone.
