You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **adapt quickly to survive in this medieval world of feudal lords, thatched-roof villages, and endless forests teeming with wolves and bandits**.

The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth. You're dressed in rough-spun woolen tunic and breeches, your feet bare on the cold mud path. No phone, no wallet, no ID—just the weight of a rusty dagger at your belt that you don't remember picking up. In the distance, a castle looms on a hill, its banners flapping in the wind, while closer by, peasants toil in rye fields with wooden plows pulled by oxen.

Hunger gnaws at you first. You spot a market stall in the nearby village: loaves of coarse bread, wheels of cheese, and suspiciously dangling haunches of meat. But the vendor eyes you warily—a stranger with odd speech and cleaner hands than most. Do you barter with a silver coin you mysteriously find in your pocket (it works, barely), steal under cover of a cart, or charm your way in with tales from "far-off lands"?

As you munch, a horn blares. Riders in chainmail thunder past, shouting about a dragon sighting in the mountains—or is it rebels? A grizzled blacksmith pulls you aside: "Ye look lost, traveler. Swear fealty to the baron, and ye'll eat steady. Or head north to the wilds, where outlaws brew mead and defy the king."

Your heart races. This dream feels too real—the sting of a nettle, the thrill of possibility. Do you pledge to the castle for safety and glory, join the outlaws for freedom and fortune, or venture alone into the unknown, crafting your own legend? The choice shapes the dream... what do you do next?
