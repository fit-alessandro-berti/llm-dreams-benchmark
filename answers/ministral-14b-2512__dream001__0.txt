**The Dream Continues:**

The air hums with an electric charge, thick with the scent of rain-soaked cobblestones and something faintly metallic—like old coins or the ghost of a forgotten machine. The city stretches endlessly around you, a labyrinth of towering spires and crumbling arches, their surfaces shifting subtly when you blink. Some buildings pulse with a soft, bioluminescent glow, while others seem to *breathe*, their stone facades expanding and contracting like living lungs.

You check your wrist—no watch. Your pockets are empty except for a single, smooth river stone, cold and heavy in your palm. A whisper slithers past your ear: *"The meeting isn’t where you think it is."* You turn, but there’s no one there. Just the wind, carrying the distant chime of a clock that doesn’t belong to any visible tower.

A narrow alley yawns ahead, its mouth lined with flickering gas lamps that cast long, skeletal fingers of light. At its center stands a **door**—not of wood or metal, but of **frozen mist**, its surface rippling like a pond disturbed by a pebble. A handwritten sign, written in ink that glows faintly blue, reads:

*"Turn left if you seek the clock. Turn right if you seek the key. Go straight if you’ve already forgotten why you’re here."*

Your heart hammers. The hour ticks away, but the city seems to resist time itself. A shadow detaches from the wall—a figure in a long, tattered coat, their face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. They hold out a **compass**, its needle spinning wildly between north and south, as if the poles have been erased.

*"You’re late,"* they murmur, voice like dry leaves. *"But the city gives second chances… for a price."*

Behind them, the mist-door begins to *melt*, revealing a glimpse of what lies beyond: a vast, circular chamber where time flows backward. A table stands at its center, set for two. One chair is empty. The other holds a **black umbrella**, its handle wrapped in silver wire.

You wake up—

—**gasping**, your sheets tangled around your legs. The digital clock on your nightstand reads **11:59**. Your phone buzzes with a notification: *"Meeting reminder: ‘The Clockmaker’s Gambit’ – 12:00 PM, Location: [Redacted]."*

And on your pillow, cold and damp, rests the **river stone** from your dream.

**What do you do?**
- **Ignore it** and assume it was just a weird dream.
- **Research "The Clockmaker’s Gambit"**—maybe it’s real.
- **Look for the river stone’s origin** (or hide it, just in case).
- **Something else?** (The dream isn’t over yet…)
