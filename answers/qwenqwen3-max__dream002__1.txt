...the air crackles with static, raising the hairs on your arms. The dappled sunlight vanishes as bruised purple clouds swallow the sky whole. Wind whips through the trees, not with the whisper of leaves, but with a low, groaning howl that seems to come from the earth itself.  

You instinctively duck behind the thick trunk of an ancient oak, its bark suddenly slick with an unnatural, iridescent dew. Rain doesn’t fall—it *pulses*. Silver droplets hang suspended for a heartbeat before slamming down like cold pebbles, each one striking the forest floor with a sound like shattering glass.  

Then you see it: the lightning. Not jagged forks, but slow, liquid rivers of violet fire that coil between the trees, illuminating roots that writhe like serpents beneath the soil. The thunder that follows isn’t a boom—it’s a chorus of whispers, overlapping voices speaking in a language that tastes like burnt honey and regret.  

You press yourself deeper into the tree’s hollow, heart hammering, when a hand—pale and cool—brushes your wrist. You whirl around, but there’s no one. Only the storm, and the forest holding its breath.  

And then, cutting through the chaos: a single, clear note. A child’s laughter, echoing from the direction of the lightning-struck path ahead.  

*Should you run toward it… or away?*  

*(The dream holds its breath with you.)*
