**...written in a language I've never seen before, with symbols that resemble a mix of ancient hieroglyphs, cuneiform, and what appears to be a dash of hieratic script. The paper itself has a strange, iridescent glow, and the text seems to shift and ripple as I stare at it, making my eyes water.**

**Panic sets in as I frantically scan the room, hoping to find someone, anyone, who can help me decipher the mysterious text. The other students, however, seem perfectly at ease, scribbling away with confidence, as if the language is second nature to them.**

**The instructor, a stern-looking figure with an unyielding gaze, walks over to my desk and clears her throat to get my attention. "Is there a problem, candidate?" she asks, her voice firm but with a hint of curiosity.**

**I try to explain my dilemma, but before I can utter a word, she hands me a small, ornate box. "Perhaps this will assist you," she says, her expression unreadable. "You have two hours to complete the exam. The box is...optional."**

**With shaking hands, I open the box, revealing:**

A) **A pair of futuristic, augmented reality glasses with a built-in universal translator.**
B) **A quill pen that begins to glow, hinting that it might imbue my writing with temporary linguistic omniscience.**
C) **A small, cryptic note that reads: "The answer lies in the silence between the symbols."**
D) **A tiny, shimmering orb that spirals out of the box and hovers above the exam paper, as if awaiting a decision.**

**Which option do you choose to proceed with the dream?**
