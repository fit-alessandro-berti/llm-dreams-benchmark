*continues the dream*

...notice the walls themselves seem to shift and breathe, their surfaces covered in symbols that rearrange when you're not looking directly at them.

The first puzzle presents itself: a door with nine rotating rings, each inscribed with mathematical sequences. As I solve it, I realize my fingers leave trails of soft light in the air. The solution clicks into place with a sound like distant bells.

Deeper now. The maze grows darker, but I've begun to glow faintly from within—as if the puzzles are *fueling* something in me rather than depleting it.

The next chamber holds a three-dimensional logic grid suspended in midair. I walk *through* it, rearranging pieces by passing my hands through floating geometries. Time feels thick here, syrupy.

Then I notice: I'm not alone. Other versions of myself are visible through translucent walls—each one solving a different branch of the maze simultaneously. When one of them completes a puzzle, I feel a fragment of understanding bloom in my mind that I didn't earn.

At the center, I find not an exit but a mirror. The final puzzle isn't on a wall or floating in space—it's *me*. The reflection asks a question I somehow already know the answer to, but the words dissolve before I can speak them.

I wake with the strange certainty that I solved it anyway.

*What did you see in the maze?*
