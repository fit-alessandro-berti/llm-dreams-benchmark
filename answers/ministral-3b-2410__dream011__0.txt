...all about the tiny details of your favorite hobbies. You're confused, as you've never studied this topic, but you remember that your favorite hobby is to collect and restore vintage cameras. The first question asks for the difference between a Pentax K1 and a Nikon D850. You scratch your head, but then realize that it's a coincidence! You decide to answer:

1. A Pentax K1 is a mirrorless camera, while a Nikon D850 is a DSLR.
2. The K1 has a slightly smaller sensor, making it more suitable for street photography, while the D850 offers a larger sensor for landscapes and portraits.
3. The K1 has a tilting LCD, while the D850 has a flip screen.

You continue to answer the questions, and surprisingly, you're getting them right! The exam proctor smiles at you and says, "You must be very passionate about your hobby if you can answer these questions so well!" You smile back, feeling a sense of accomplishment and excitement. As you finish the exam, you think to yourself, "Maybe I should consider a career in photography after all!"
