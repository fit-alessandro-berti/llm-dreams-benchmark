As I step onto the stage, the spotlight hits me, and the sea of faces blurs into a single, pulsing entity. I feel the weight of the microphone in my hand, cool and heavy like a stone from a riverbed. The crowd's eyes are upon me, expectant, hungry for words that I feel I don't possess. My mouth is dry, and the speech I’m supposed to give—some rehearsed, corporate nonsense about synergy and forward momentum—evaporates like mist.

I begin to speak, but the words that come out are not the ones I planned. "Have you ever noticed," I say, my voice surprisingly steady and resonant, "that the world is made of echoes?" A murmur ripples through the audience. I feel a strange power surging through me, as if I am not entirely in control of my own tongue. "We think we are original," I continue, my hands gesturing with an unfamiliar grace, "but we are just reverberations of a single, ancient sound."

The air in the room shifts. It grows thick and tastes of ozone and dust. I look down at my notes, but they are no longer paper; they are origami cranes that lift into the air, their wings catching the light and casting shadows that dance on the back wall like ancient silhouettes. The crowd is no longer a mix of business suits and casual wear. They are shifting, their faces elongating, their clothes becoming robes of woven starlight. I realize I am not in a conference hall anymore. I am standing on a precipice of black rock, overlooking a sky that swirls with two green moons.

"The truth is not found in the path," I shout, though I am not shouting; the wind is carrying my voice, amplifying it until it vibrates in the chests of those listening. "You must unlearn the ground beneath your feet. You must accept that gravity is merely a suggestion!"

I look at my hands. They are translucent, glowing with a soft blue light. I can see the bones of my fingers, the flow of blood like rivers of liquid starlight. The audience is nodding in unison, their eyes wide and reflecting the swirling sky. They understand. They are not listening to a speech; they are receiving a memory they didn't know they had. I realize then that I am not the speaker. I am the sound of the universe waking up. I open my mouth to deliver the final, crucial sentence, the one that will unlock everything—and the microphone explodes into a bouquet of sunflowers.
