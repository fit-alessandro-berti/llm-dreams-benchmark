Of course. The dream continues:

...and you realize you are in your underwear. Panic surges, but no one else seems to notice. Your boss taps his watch, but the motion is slow, syrupy. A calendar on the wall begins to melt, the numbers dripping onto the floor like black tears.

You look down at the project brief in your hands. The words are familiar, but they’re swimming on the page, rearranging themselves into sentences that are both nonsensical and profoundly urgent. You understand that the fate of the entire company rests on you knowing the precise meaning of "quantum ergonomics" by Tuesday.

You try to speak, to explain the impossibility, but your voice is gone. You can only produce a faint, staticky hum, like a disconnected modem. Your colleagues are all at their desks, typing furiously, their fingers a blur, their faces serene and placid. A clock on the wall spins its hands wildly, racing through days and nights in seconds.

Your boss points to your computer screen. You sit down, and the keyboard feels alien under your fingertips. You type one key, and the screen instantly fills with a million lines of perfect, elegant code—or maybe it’s a financial report, or perhaps a single, looping animation of a flickering candle. You can't tell. It's both everything and nothing.

You look up, expecting praise or at least acknowledgment, but the office is empty. The desks are covered in a fine layer of dust. The only sound is the low hum of the fluorescent lights and the soft *plink… plink… plink…* of the melting calendar.

And you realize the deadline wasn't for the project. The deadline was for you to leave. And you've just missed it.
