**Dream Continuation:**  

As you reach toward the blank canvas, the air hums with possibility. Your fingertips brush its surface, and instantly, ripples of color bloom outward—vivid cerulean, molten gold, and deep violet swirl into fractal patterns. The canvas *breathes*, responding to your thoughts. A landscape materializes: jagged mountains that melt into rivers of starlight, trees with leaves shaped like eyes that blink in unison.  

A brush appears in your hand, though you don’t recall grasping it. Every stroke you make alters the world around you. The sky pulses with your heartbeat; the ground softens into a mosaic of whispers. You paint a door, and it swings open, revealing a corridor of mirrors. Each reflection shows a version of yourself—some winged, some translucent, one made entirely of smoke.  

Suddenly, the canvas *pulls* you inward. You’re suspended in the painting now, floating among your own creations. The wind carries fragments of forgotten songs, and the stars arrange themselves into words you can almost read—**"Remember"**—before dissolving.  

As dawn bleeds into the dream, the canvas folds itself into a paper crane and flies away. You wake with the scent of wet paint lingering in the air, and the unshakable sense that somewhere, the world you painted still breathes.
