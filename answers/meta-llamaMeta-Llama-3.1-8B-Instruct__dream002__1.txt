The sky above me darkens and the air grows thick with electricity.

I quicken my pace, feeling a sense of unease wash over me as the wind picks up, carrying the scent of damp earth and ozone.

As I walk faster, the trees seem to close in around me, their limbs reaching out like skeletal fingers. The distance between them shortens, and I find myself forced to navigate a narrow, twisting path as the storm rushes in. I hear the first drops of rain start to fall, a gentle patter at first, but growing heavier by the second.

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning illuminates the sky, casting an eerie blue glow over the forest. I feel a jolt of fear as I realize I'm not sure which way to go. The trees seem to be shifting and swirling around me, making it impossible to discern any sort of direction or escape.

The lightning flashes again, and I see that the tree's trunk is glowing with a soft, ethereal light...
