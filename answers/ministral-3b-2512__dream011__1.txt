**Dream Continuation:**

You notice the questions are *not* the typical textbook-style multiple-choice or essay prompts you’ve seen before. Instead, the paper is covered in **handwritten equations, cryptic symbols, and a single, ominous question at the top:**

**"What do you *really* want to be when you wake up?"**

The ink is smudged, as if someone else has been scribbling over it in the margins—now the question reads:

**"Or… what do you *actually* fear becoming?"**

Your hands tremble as you glance at the clock on your desk: **4:37 AM**. The exam is due in **two hours**, but the room feels heavier than usual. The air smells like old books and something metallic—like blood.

Then, the page shifts on its own. The questions rearrange themselves into a **spiral pattern**, and suddenly, you’re no longer looking at a test. You’re looking at a **mirror**.

But this mirror isn’t reflecting your face. Instead, it shows **a dozen versions of yourself**—each one holding a different object:

- One is holding a **burned-out laptop**, whispering, *"You were supposed to code."*
- Another is clutching a **stack of rejection letters**, their edges singed, with the words *"No talent"* scrawled in red ink.
- A third is standing in a **library of empty shelves**, a book titled *"The Truth About You"* open to a blank page.

The most unsettling one is **you**, but older—your face lined with exhaustion, your eyes hollow. You’re holding a **blackboard**, and the words *"I failed myself first"* are written in chalk.

A voice, not your own, murmurs from the shadows:
*"You were born to be something. But what? The exam is just the beginning."*

Then—**a knock at the door**. It’s your professor, but their face is **wrong**. Their eyes are too wide, their lips moving silently as they say:
*"You passed. But the real test starts when you leave this room."*

The door swings open, and the hallway beyond is **empty**. No corridors. No hallways. Just a **single, endless hallway** stretching into the distance, lined with doors—each one labeled with a career path you’ve never considered:

- *"The Man Who Erases Names"*
- *"The Architect of Forgotten Places"*
- *"The Keeper of Things That Shouldn’t Exist"*
- *"The One Who Makes People Forget Their Own Names"*

One door is ajar. Inside, you see a **child**—your own child—standing in a room of **mirrors**. The child is holding a **key**, and the reflection behind them is **you**, smiling.

The professor’s voice echoes again:
*"Choose wisely. The first question is always the hardest."*

**What do you do?**
Do you:
A) **Pick a door at random**, hoping for the best?
B) **Ask the child for advice**—but the reflection in the mirror is already turning away?
C) **Write your own question** on the blackboard and leave it there for the next version of you?
D) **Something else entirely**—(describe your dream’s resolution here).
