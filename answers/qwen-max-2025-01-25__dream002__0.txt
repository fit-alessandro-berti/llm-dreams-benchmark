You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air grows heavy, crackling with electricity. The once gentle rustle of leaves turns into an ominous howl as wind whips through the trees. Dark clouds churn above, swallowing the sunlight, casting long shadows that twist unnaturally across the ground.

The first raindrop hits your cheek like a cold warning, followed quickly by another—and then a deluge. The downpour soaks you instantly, plastering your clothes to your skin. Thunder rumbles in the distance, growing louder with each passing second, until it feels as though the sky itself is splitting apart.

You look around for shelter but notice something strange: the trees seem to be moving—not swaying from the wind, but *shifting* on their own. Their branches stretch outward, curling toward you like grasping fingers. Roots tear free from the earth, lifting themselves up as if alive. Panic sets in as you realize this forest isn’t just reacting to the storm—it’s part of it.

A massive oak tree ahead splits open at its trunk, revealing a hollow space glowing faintly with golden light. Something inside calls to you—a soft, melodic hum that resonates deep within your chest. It feels both comforting and terrifying, pulling you closer despite the chaos surrounding you.

As you step toward the tree, the ground beneath your feet begins to tremble. A shadow passes over you, darker than the storm clouds above. Looking up, you see enormous wings blotting out what little light remains—a creature descending from the heavens, or perhaps something older, something forgotten.

Do you run for the safety of the glowing tree, or do you face the winged beast descending upon you?
