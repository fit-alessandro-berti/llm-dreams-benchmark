...walk away to the edge of a cliff that suddenly appears where your living room used to be. The argument fades into muffled echoes as you look down into swirling mist below. Your friend's voice becomes the sound of waves, and when you turn back, they've transformed into a bird—maybe a crow, or is it an owl?—perched on a chair that's now impossibly tall.

You try to apologize, but the words come out as colored smoke, purple and gold, forming symbols you almost recognize from a language you don't remember learning. The bird-friend tilts its head and suddenly you both understand each other perfectly without speaking.

The room begins to fold in on itself like origami. You're not frightened—you realize you've been here before, though you can't remember when. Your friend is themselves again, smiling now, holding out something in their palm. Is it a key? A seed? You reach for it and your hand passes through theirs like water.

"This always happens," one of you says—you're not sure who.

The floor becomes soft moss, and you're both sinking pleasantly into earth that smells like your childhood home. The argument wasn't about what you thought it was about. You both know this now. Above you, the ceiling opens to a sky full of doors, and you're laughing together, choosing which one to walk through next.
