**Dream Continuation:**  

You wake in a dim, straw-strewn loft, the air thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth. Through a small window, you see a village of thatched roofs and cobblestone streets, where people in coarse woolen tunics barter goods from carts. The clang of a blacksmith’s hammer echoes in the distance. *Medieval*, you realize—a world without electricity, engines, or phones. Your heart races as you grapple with the reality: you’ve slipped through time.  

Descending a creaking ladder, you stumble into a bustling tavern. A woman in an apron thrusts a clay mug of ale into your hands, mistaking your shock for thirst. “Here, traveler,” she says, eyeing your strange clothes. “You’ve the look of one who’s seen the Fae.” Before you can ask questions, a commotion erupts outside. A boy bursts in, shouting, “The Baron’s men are at the bridge again—they’ll take the harvest!”  

The villagers scatter, but an old weaver grips your arm. “Stranger,” she whispers, her voice urgent, “you arrived at the stone circle at dawn, didn’t you? The one with the carvings… like *this*.” She traces a symbol on your palm: the same jagged spiral you’d sketched in your notebook days ago, half-remembered from a dream. “You’re here for the Threshold,” she insists. “But to reopen it, you’ll need the Ash Key—and the Baron seeks it too.”  

Your modern mind races. Surviving this era means blending in, but escaping it might require unraveling its secrets. You barter your wristwatch (now useless) for a cloak and dagger, then slip into the woods, following the weaver’s clues. As night falls, you find the stone circle—the air humming with static, as if time itself is thin here. But the Baron’s soldiers arrive, torches blazing, and their leader snarls, “The Key belongs to those who grasp the future!”  

Suddenly, the weaver’s words make terrible sense: the Key isn’t an object. It’s a choice. To return home, you must leave this era to its fate… or stay and spark a rebellion that could alter history. The soldiers advance. Your hand closes around the dagger. The stones begin to glow.  

— You jolt awake, sheets tangled, the taste of ale still on your tongue. On your nightstand, a sketch of the spiral glows faintly in the dawn light.
