**The Dream Continues…**

You check your pockets—no phone, no wallet, just a single, crumpled business card with the meeting location scrawled in smudged ink: *"The Obsidian Spire, 13th Floor."* The address is missing. Around you, the city hums with an eerie, shifting energy. The streets twist like a labyrinth, buildings stretching impossibly tall, their windows flickering with strange lights. Somewhere, a clock tower chimes—*three times*—but the sound echoes unnaturally, as if time itself is bending.

A woman in a long, tattered coat brushes past you, muttering, *"The Spire only appears when it wants to."* You call after her, but she’s already dissolving into the crowd like smoke. Then you notice the people around you aren’t quite… *people*. Their faces blur when you try to focus, their voices overlapping in a chorus of whispers: *"You’re late. You’re always late."*

A child tugs your sleeve. *"Take the black tram,"* they say, pointing to a sleek, windowless train idling at a platform that wasn’t there a second ago. The doors hiss open. Inside, the seats are empty, but the air smells like ozone and old paper. The child grins—*too many teeth*—and vanishes.

You step onto the tram. The doors seal shut. The lights dim.

The train lurches forward, but the city outside the windows isn’t moving. Instead, the buildings *unfold*, revealing layers of the city you didn’t know existed—streets that loop back on themselves, bridges that lead to nowhere, a skyline that pulses like a living thing. A voice crackles over the intercom: *"Destination: The Obsidian Spire. Please remain seated. Time is not guaranteed."*

Then the lights flicker out.

When they return, you’re standing in a vast, circular lobby. The walls are made of black glass, reflecting not your face, but *other versions of you*—some younger, some older, some wearing clothes you don’t recognize. A receptionist with no eyes smiles at you from behind a desk. *"Ah, you’ve arrived,"* they say. *"The meeting started without you."*

You turn. A long table stretches into the distance, filled with people you *should* know—colleagues, mentors, even a childhood friend—but their faces keep shifting, their voices overlapping. At the head of the table sits *you*, older, wearing a suit that shimmers like liquid metal. They stand, extending a hand. *"We’ve been waiting,"* they say. *"But you’re here now. That’s what matters."*

The dream tilts. The room spins. The other *you* leans in, whispering: *"Do you remember why you came?"*

And then—

You wake up.

Your alarm is blaring. You’re in your bed, drenched in sweat, the meeting time flashing on your phone: **1 HOUR AGO.**

But on your nightstand, there’s a single, unfamiliar object: a black business card with one word embossed in silver:

**"OBSIDIAN."**

And beneath it, in your own handwriting: *"Next time, take the tram."*
