### **Dream Continuation:**

You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you can feel the weight of expectation in the room. The project is vaguely explained — something about “rebuilding the core algorithm from scratch by tomorrow morning.” You nod, even though your mind is already racing with panic.

As you sit down at your desk, the clock on the wall ticks loudly, each second echoing like a drumbeat. Your computer screen flickers to life, but instead of your usual development environment, it shows a strange, endless maze of code — lines upon lines of syntax that shift and morph like liquid. You try to type, but your fingers freeze over the keyboard. The letters you manage to input twist into symbols you don’t recognize, and the screen flashes red: **“ERROR: Temporal Integrity Compromised.”**

Your boss appears behind you, silent, watching. You can feel their gaze like a spotlight on your neck. You stand up, trying to ask for clarification, but your voice is trapped inside you. The office around you begins to distort — the fluorescent lights dim and pulse like a heartbeat, and the walls creep inward, closing in on you. Papers float in the air, and your coworkers are gone. Only the ticking clock remains, now counting down from **00:03:02**.

Suddenly, a soft voice whispers in your ear:  
*“You don’t have to do this alone.”*

You turn and see a version of yourself — younger, calmer — sitting in a chair you didn’t notice before. They point to a hidden door behind your desk. Without thinking, you walk toward it. The door creaks open to reveal a dark hallway lit only by glowing blue veins running along the walls. You step through.

The hallway leads to a vast, open space — a dreamscape of your mind. Floating platforms hover in the air, each labeled with a different fear or failure you’ve ever had: *“Not Good Enough,” “Too Late,” “They’ll Find Out.”* You step onto the one that reads **“Impossible.”** The platform shudders, and a wave of dizziness washes over you.

But then, from the shadows, figures emerge — not enemies, but echoes of people you’ve helped in the past. A former coworker you mentored, a friend whose code you debugged, even a child from a coding workshop you once led. They step onto the platform with you, and one by one, they begin to dismantle the fear, brick by brick. Each piece that falls disappears into a glowing vortex above.

The younger version of you appears again, handing you a small, glowing key. “You’re not just trying to meet a deadline,” they say. “You’re learning to trust the team you’ve built — and the strength you’ve carried all along.”

You wake up in your bed, drenched in sweat, the alarm clock buzzing insistently. It’s not the deadline anymore. It’s just another Monday.

And you smile.
