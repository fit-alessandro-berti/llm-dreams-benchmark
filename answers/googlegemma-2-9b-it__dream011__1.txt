...completely blank.   

Panic rises in my chest, constricting my breath. My palms sweat, cold and slick against the smooth exam paper. Across the room, others huff and puff, scribbling furiously, their pens scratching like tiny, panicked beetles against the paper. But my paper remains a stark, daunting white.  

Was this a joke? A cruel prank?  I glance at the professor, his face impassive as always, eyes fixed on a faded tapestry hanging on the wall. Had he intentionally left the exam blank? What was the point of this test if there were no questions to answer?

Confusion morphs into a strange calm. This isn't a test of knowledge, I realize. It's a test of something else. A test of... creation. 

I pick up my pen, the weight of it strangely comforting. Slowly, I begin to write. Not the answers the textbook drilled into my head, not the formulaic responses I'd practiced ad nauseam. I write about my passions, about the problems I see in the world and the solutions I envision. I write about the stories I yearn to tell and the technologies I dream of building. 

As I write, the room fades away. The pressure lifts. The blank page becomes a canvas, my pen a paintbrush. I pour my heart and soul onto the paper, and for the first time, I feel truly seen. Not by the professor, not by the other students, but by myself. 

And in that moment, I know that the future isn't predetermined by a test, but by the stories we choose to tell, the dreams we choose to chase. This isn't just an exam. It's my own personal journey, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
