...begin to shrink. Not just metaphorically, overwhelmed by the enormity of the moment, but literally. My shoes became too big, my suit billowed around me like a parachute, and my voice, when I tried to speak, came out a high-pitched squeak. Panic swelled as I watched the audience's expressions shift from anticipation to bemusement, then to open laughter. A child in the front row pointed and yelled, "Look at the tiny man!"

Suddenly, a giant hand scooped me up from the stage. It belonged to a woman, her face obscured by the blinding stage lights, but her touch was gentle. She held me close to her ear and whispered, "Don't worry, little one. You don't need to be big to be heard." Then, she cupped her other hand around me, creating a makeshift megaphone.

Taking a deep breath, I spoke into the echoing chamber of her palm. My voice, amplified and surprisingly resonant, filled the entire auditorium. The laughter died down, replaced by a hushed silence. I spoke about my dream, a dream so vivid and important that even shrinking to the size of a mouse couldn't silence it. I spoke of courage, of vulnerability, and the power of finding your voice, no matter how small you might feel. 

When I finished, the applause was deafening. The giant woman gently placed me back on the stage, now no bigger than a thimble. But something had changed. The fear was gone, replaced by a sense of exhilaration.  I took a bow, my tiny body brimming with confidence, knowing that even the smallest voice can resonate if given the chance. And as the dream began to fade, I carried that feeling with me, a reminder that true strength isn't about size, but about the courage to speak your truth.
