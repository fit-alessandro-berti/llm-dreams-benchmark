…and each group feels like a different fragment of a world you half-remember.

---

The first group is gathered around a high table piled with empty glasses and cocktail napkins scribbled with numbers and arrows. They’re laughing loudly, overlapping each other, speaking in punchlines instead of sentences.

You approach, thinking maybe your friend is among them.

“Hey,” you say. “Have you seen—”

Before you can finish, one of them turns to you. Their face is familiar in the way of strangers in dreams: like someone you might have passed once on a train.

“Oh, you’re late,” they say, as if they’ve been waiting. “We already told your story.”

“My… story?”

The others nod. A woman with bright red lipstick flips over a napkin and shows you a dense maze drawn in ink.

“See? You started here,” she says, tapping a corner. “Then you took a left when you said you wouldn’t, remember? That’s where things got interesting.”

The napkin maze looks suspiciously like the floor plan of this building, or maybe of your life. It’s hard to tell. The lines blur if you stare too long.

“Wait,” you say, but their attention has already slid away from you like water. Someone cracks a joke and they all burst into laughter, including the one who showed you the napkin. As they laugh, the maze rearranges itself, corridors shifting, walls vanishing.

You glance around for your friend. They’re not here. You move on.

---

The second group is in a quieter corner, perched on a sunken sofa that seems to sag in the middle like an exhausted sigh. These people aren’t talking; they’re scrolling. Each holds a phone, but the screens are turned outward so you can see them.

They’re all displaying your face.

One screen shows you as you were last week, squinting into a bathroom mirror. Another shows you as a kid in a backyard you haven’t thought about in years, holding a plastic bucket full of rainwater. Another shows you sitting exactly as you are now, in this very moment, looking at them, looking at you.

“Have you seen my friend?” you ask, trying to avoid your own gaze on the screens.

They don’t look up, but somehow they answer in chorus.

“Which friend?”

“The one I came here with,” you say. “The only one I know.”

“Ah,” says the version of you on the nearest screen. Its lips move, though the person holding the phone does not. “You always say that. Every time.”

“Every time what?” you ask.

But the screen glitches: your face stretches, melts, and rearranges into a pixelated swirl of color. The others follow, dissolving into static. One by one, the phones power off. The group sighs, sinking deeper into the cushions, as if they’ve just missed something important but they can’t remember what.

You suddenly feel like you’ve stayed too long. You move on.

---

You pass a buffet table where the food is too carefully arranged. The cheese cubes are perfect little cubes—unsettlingly perfect, with no crumbs, no variation in shade. The fruit slices gleam like photographs of fruit rather than actual fruit. You reach for a strawberry and your hand passes through it as if it’s a hologram.

A person in a waiter’s uniform appears beside you.

“We stopped serving reality a while ago,” they inform you. “People complained about the aftertaste.”

“Oh,” you say. “Do you know if my friend is still here?”

The waiter tilts their head, considering.

“That depends,” they say. “Are you still here?”

You open your mouth to answer, but the lights flicker. When they steady again, the waiter is gone. The buffet is gone. You’re standing in a hallway you don’t remember walking into.

---

The hallway is lined with doors. Each door is open just a crack, enough for sounds to slip out.

From the first door on your left, you hear music and the clink of glass. Laughter, high and sharp.

You peek in.

Inside is a group of people all telling stories that start with “Remember when you…” It takes you a second to realize every story is about you—things you did, things you never did, things you might have done in a different version of yourself.

“Remember when you decided to leave?” someone says.

“Remember when you decided to stay?” says another.

You look closer. You don’t recognize any of their faces, and yet each one speaks with the ease of an old friend. You wait for them to mention the name of the person you’re looking for, but they never do. The air in the room feels thick with expectation, like you’re supposed to step in and correct them, but you don’t. You pull the door quietly shut.

---

At the next door, you hear soft weeping, the kind that might be laughter in disguise. You don’t open that one.

From another, you hear a lecture on something very important you forgot to learn. The words are long and slippery—“ontological,” “epistemic,” “liminality”—and every time you try to grasp their meaning, they slide away like soap in the bath.

You keep walking.

---

Eventually you come to a door with no sound behind it at all. Just silence, thick and humming.

Your friend might be in there, you think. It feels promising, the way a blank page feels like it could become anything.

You push it open.

Inside is a small, quiet room with only two chairs facing each other. One is empty. The other is occupied by someone whose face is blurred, as if they’re slightly out of focus. The rest of them is sharp: their hands folded, one foot tapping lightly, a posture familiar in a way that makes your chest tighten.

“Finally,” they say. Their voice is exactly like your friend’s, and also exactly like your own. “You took the scenic route this time.”

“Where is everyone?” you ask, realizing suddenly that the noise of the party is distant now, like a radio in another house.

“They’re still there,” the blurred person says. “You moved.”

You sit down in the empty chair because that’s what chairs are for, and because your legs feel a little weak.

“I’ve been looking for you,” you say.

“I know,” they reply. “You always are.”

You want to see their face properly, but every time you focus on it, your eyes slide to the wall behind them, or to their hands, or to the faint scuff on the floor between you. It’s like trying to look directly at a memory.

“Why is this so hard?” you ask.

“Finding someone?” they say.

“Finding you.”

They shrug. The motion seems to echo, like more than one person has shrugged at the same time.

“You get distracted,” they say. “You stop to listen to stories. You stand at tables full of things you can’t eat. You peer through doors at lives you might have had. You forget who you were looking for.”

“That’s not fair,” you protest. “It’s a big party.”

“It always is,” they say.

You lean forward.

“Then tell me where my friend is. The real one. The one I came here with.”

They study you for a moment, blurred eyes steady on your face.

“What’s their name?” they ask gently.

You open your mouth.

Nothing comes out.

You realize, with a small, cold jolt, that you’ve been saying “my friend” this entire time, like a placeholder in a sentence you never finished. You have a sense of them—warmth, a particular way of laughing, a shape beside you in a crowd—but the details evaporate when you try to pin them down. No name. No face. Just the conviction that they exist.

“See?” the figure says softly. “You always start in the middle.”

They stand, and as they do, the room tilts a little, like a boat in slow motion. They come to stand in front of you, close enough that you can see the edges of their blur, the way they almost resolve into something familiar. You feel that if you just concentrate hard enough—

“Don’t force it,” they say. “Just notice.”

So you notice:

Their posture is exactly how you stand when you’re trying not to look awkward. Their hands move like your hands when you’re explaining something you care about. The way their weight shifts from one foot to the other—yes, that’s you too.

“Are you…” You swallow. “Are you supposed to be me?”

“Supposed to be?” they repeat, amused. “I am who you talk to when you say ‘I don’t know anyone here.’”

The party sounds swell again in your ears: laughter, clinking glasses, the murmur of a hundred conversations, none of which you’re part of. You remember arriving, your friend beside you, reassuring you. Or did you arrive alone, imagining they were there so you wouldn’t have to enter by yourself? The memory flickers between versions.

“But I only know one person here,” you insist, even now.

The figure nods.

“Yes,” they say. “And you keep forgetting who it is.”

They reach out a hand. You hesitate, then take it. Their fingers feel exactly like your own: same temperature, same calluses in the same places. As your hands touch, the blur around their face starts to clear.

You brace yourself to see your own features reflected back at you.

Instead, you see something stranger and truer: not your face as it is, but as you remember it on different days. Younger, older, tired, hopeful. The face shifts fluidly through time, wearing every version of you that has stood alone in a crowded room and scanned for a familiar anchor.

It’s not any single face. It’s the feeling of being you.

“Found me,” they say.

A laugh bubbles out of you, startled and a little shaky.

“So I came looking for my friend,” you say slowly, “and I found… myself.”

“That’s one way to put it,” they say. “Or: you stopped pretending you were alone.”

You think of the groups you passed: people telling your stories, people scrolling through your images, doors full of alternate possibilities. All of them were about you, in one way or another. The only person you didn’t really look at was… well. You.

“Can we go back out there?” you ask. “To the party?”

“If you want,” they say. “It’ll be easier this time.”

“Why?”

They squeeze your hand, and now you can’t tell where your fingers end and theirs begin. The two of you turn toward the door.

“Because,” they say, “now you know someone.”

You walk out together.

---

Back in the main room, the music is the same, the groups are the same, the maze and the screens and the buffet of unreal food are all exactly as you left them—and somehow, they’re different. When someone laughs, it doesn’t sound like a wall; it sounds like a possibility. When someone looks your way, you don’t flinch. You nod, and someone nods back.

You turn to say something to the person at your side, your one familiar anchor.

There’s no one there.

Just you, standing in a crowd that suddenly feels less like a test and more like a landscape. You feel a flicker of panic, then remember: this is a dream. You remind yourself out loud, just to hear it.

“I’m dreaming,” you say.

The room doesn’t vanish. No one freezes. The party goes on.

But something quiet and steady settles in your chest: the knowledge that the person you were searching for has not disappeared. They’ve just moved a little closer in.

You take a breath.

You pick a group.

You step forward.
