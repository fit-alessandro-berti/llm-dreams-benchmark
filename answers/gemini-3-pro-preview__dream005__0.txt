...notice that their conversations aren't made of words, but of floating geometric shapes. One group is laughing, but the sound is the chiming of glass bells, and bubbles drift from their lips, popping into clouds of glitter.

I try to squeeze past a circle of tall figures wearing velvet coats, but as I brush against them, they turn into flat, cardboard cutouts. The room begins to stretch like taffy. The ceiling lifts higher and higher until it becomes a night sky filled with paper lanterns.

I spot the person I know—Sam—standing on the other side of the room. He is holding a giant, glowing red telephone. I wave, but my arm moves through thick, invisible syrup. I try to shout his name, but my voice comes out as a flock of moths.

As I push forward, the floor transforms into a thick, shag carpet that grows rapidly, turning into tall grass. The party guests are now grazing like deer, ignoring me. I finally reach the spot where Sam was standing, but he is gone. In his place is a mirror floating in mid-air. When I look into it, I don't see my reflection; I see the room behind me, completely empty, silent, and covered in dust, as if the party ended fifty years ago.

Suddenly, the red telephone starts to ring, loud and shrill, vibrating against the floorboards, and I realize the ringing is coming from inside my own pocket.
