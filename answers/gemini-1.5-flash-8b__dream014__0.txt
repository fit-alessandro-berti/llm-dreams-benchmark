You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city.  Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you  follow them, drawn not by any spoken words, but by the gentle warmth radiating from their shared, almost silent camaraderie. They are dressed in mismatched, vibrant fabrics - a patchwork quilt of colours and patterns – and their movements, though swift, are surprisingly graceful, like dancers navigating a crowded stage.  Their hands, clasped together in a loose chain, seem to pulse with a shared energy, and you instinctively feel drawn to the rhythmic, almost hypnotic sway of their collective stride. They weave through the throng of people, avoiding the chaotic rush of cars and the cacophony of horns, as if the city itself were parting for them.

You feel a sense of relief washing over you, a lightness that momentarily banishes the fear and despair.  Their presence is like a comforting balm, a tangible manifestation of kindness in a world that often feels indifferent.  As they guide you deeper into the city,  you notice that the buildings, once towering and imposing, are now painted in softer hues, imbued with a gentle, ethereal glow. The sounds of the city, once overwhelming, now blend into a soothing symphony, the rhythm of their steps echoing in your heart.  You glimpse glimpses of other strangers, similarly adrift, but as the group reaches them, they seem to simply melt into the group, disappearing like mist.


They finally bring you to a small, hidden park, nestled between towering skyscrapers.  Sunlight streams through the leaves of ancient trees, dappling the ground in golden light.  There, amidst a garden of blooming lilies, stands a small, weathered bench.  You sit down, and as you look out at the city, once bewildering, it seems now to be a masterpiece, a carefully orchestrated tapestry of colours and life.  A sense of peace settles over you, profound and quiet. You look at the strangers who surround you; they're smiling, their eyes reflecting the beauty of the scene, and though you don't know their names or where they're from, you know you'll never forget their kindness. They give you a single, luminous flower, pressed between two leaves, and with a final, knowing glance, they fade away, dissolving into the air like a breath, leaving you alone with the flower and the quiet beauty of the city. You realize that you never needed to be directed, but rather to be shown how to find your own way home.
