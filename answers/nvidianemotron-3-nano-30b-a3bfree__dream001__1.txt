You awaken—well, not really awaken, but the dream folds itself deeper—into a city that seems to have been sketched by a fever‑dreaming cartographer with a love for paradoxes.  

The streets are paved with translucent tiles that pulse faintly under your feet, each step revealing a ripple of color like ink spreading across water. Above you, arches that should be solid are made of woven starlight, flickering whenever a distant chord of an unseen instrument rings out.  

Every direction looks the same, yet something tugs at the edge of your awareness: a faint, rhythmic ticking that seems to echo from everywhere and nowhere at once. You lift your wrist, and the watch you thought you’d left on your nightstand is nowhere to be seen, but a small, brass key dangles from an invisible chain attached to the cuff of your shirt. It spins slowly, catching the strange light, and with each rotation a tiny, crystalline chime rings out.  

You start to move, not running—your body knows how to glide in this place—but drifting, following the pulse of the tiles. The city responds to your motion: when you turn left, a doorway materializes out of thin air, its frame made of scrolling script that rearranges itself as you pass. The script reads, in a language you somehow understand, “Time is a river you cannot step into twice, but you may wade.”  

A few blocks away, a towering clock tower looms—its face is a mosaic of moving pictures: a child laughing, a ship sinking, a galaxy spiraling, each frame looping endlessly. The hour hand is missing; instead, a slender, silver filament slides back and forth, tracing invisible arcs in the air. The minute hand is a blade of glass that slices the night, leaving a faint, luminous slash that fades almost as soon as it appears.  

Your heart quickens—there’s an urgency, a sense that something important hinges on reaching a place you cannot yet see. The key in your hand begins to vibrate, humming with a low, resonant tone that matches the ticking you’ve been hearing. You feel the key’s teeth align with something unseen, as if it’s trying to open a lock that exists only in the architecture of this dream.

You follow the humming, winding through alleys that fold back on themselves, past cafés where the patrons are silhouettes of people you’ve never met, sipping liquid that glows like fireflies. Somewhere a chorus of soft voices sings a lullaby that seems to be made of clock gears clicking into place.  

Finally, you arrive at a square centered by a fountain of liquid glass. The water flows upward, spiraling into the sky, and at its apex it solidifies into a perfect sphere—your missing watch! It hovers there, ticking steadily, its hands moving backwards, counting down to something you can feel but not yet name.  

When you reach out, the sphere responds not with resistance but with a warm, humming pressure that steadies your breath. A whisper threads through the glass, “You are here. The meeting is not a place, but a moment. It begins when you choose to step into it.”

The sphere cracks open, and inside reveals a tiny, folded piece of paper. You unfold it with a fingertip of light, and the words written on it pulse with the same rhythmic ticking:  

*“When the clock strikes thirteen, the door you seek will open. Trust the key, trust the pulse, and let the city’s heartbeat guide you.”*  

A sudden surge of clarity floods your mind. The “meeting” isn’t a person or a room—it’s the very instant you decide to trust this surreal logic and let the key guide you to wherever the pulse leads.  

With that thought, you slip the key into the hollow where the hour hand should be. It fits perfectly. The filament of the clock tower shivers, and the missing hand—now a perfect, glowing needle—snaps into place, pointing not to a number but to a direction you can finally see: a narrow alley lined with doors that each bear a different time on their brass plates—07:00, 13:00, 19:00—​and each one slightly ajar, inviting you to step through.  

You take a breath, feel the dream’s weight settle around you like a familiar coat, and step toward the door that reads **13:00**. As the door swings open, the ticking slows, then stops, replaced by a silence that is somehow louder than any sound you’ve ever heard.  

And just as you cross the threshold, a voice—both yours and not yours—whispers, “Welcome, dreamer. Your meeting has finally begun.”  

The dream folds inward, and the city behind you shimmers, waiting for the next wanderer to lose themselves in its impossible streets.  

What door will you choose? Which time will you step into? And what will you bring back when you wake, if you ever truly wake?  

The answer, like all dreams, is yours to create.
