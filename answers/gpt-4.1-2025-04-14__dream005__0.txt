each group seems to be speaking in a language you almost—but not quite—understand. The room itself shifts subtly as you move: marble columns briefly morph into tall, flowering trees, and chandeliers above your head shimmer with strange, warm constellations.

You approach a group in formal suits painted with shimmering colors. Their laughter sounds like birdsong, and as you laugh along—trying to fit in—one of them hands you a folded paper crane. Its wings flutter; you feel a faint breeze. You unfold the crane and inside find a map, hand-drawn, leading to another room.

As you follow the map, the people around you change attire from evening gowns to raincoats and umbrellas, though the weather inside never changes. You realize you’re walking in slow motion while everyone else moves at normal speed.

Finally, your friend appears at the top of a grand staircase. They call your name—but their voice echoes with the sound of distant chimes. Relieved, you move toward them, climbing the stairs, but with every step the staircase grows longer, curving upward into soft, glowing clouds.

You reach out and almost touch their hand. Then you awaken with the sense that you’ve forgotten something beautifully important, the echo of laughter, and a folded paper crane left beneath your pillow.
