unexpected twists. The first challenge tests your creativity: you’re seated at a long table with art supplies, asked to design an object that represents your true self. Your hands move instinctively, colors swirling together, forming a shape that even surprises you—a bridge made of intertwining threads.

The judges nod, scribbling notes. The next round is a test of resolve. You’re led blindfolded into a room. Ambient sounds buzz—laughter, rain, distant voices. A voice instructs you to choose the door that leads forward, based only on what you feel. Your fingers brush cold metal, then rough wood. You notice a faint warmth radiating from a third door. You choose it, heart pounding.

When the blindfold is removed, you find yourself on a stage, facing the audience—your mentors, childhood friends, and people you’ve long admired. The final challenge is to answer a question no one has ever asked you: *What do you fear about succeeding?*

You stand, breath caught, and then answer honestly—about the pressure and the doubt, about the changes you fear but also the courage you know has brought you this far.

The judges confer, and finally, your name is called—the winner. The prize is more than a job: it’s a sense of peace and purpose. As you step forward, applause erupts and the dream dissolves into soft morning light.
