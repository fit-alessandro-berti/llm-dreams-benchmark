**Dream Continuation:**

The air hums with laughter and clinking glasses, the scent of spiced wine and roasted herbs thick in the golden twilight. You weave through clusters of strangers—some deep in animated conversation, others lost in their own worlds, sipping from ornate cups or tracing patterns in the air with their fingers. A woman in a shimmering emerald dress leans against a pillar, her lips curled into a knowing smile as she watches a man in a tailored coat attempt (and fail) to balance a tray of floating candelabras. Nearby, a group of children chase a silver fox that vanishes into the crowd, leaving only a trail of glittering paw prints.

Then—there. A flicker of familiarity. A voice, half-lost in the murmur of the room: *"You’re late. The clockwork owl said you’d never make it."* You turn, and there they are—your one known person, standing beneath a chandelier that pulses like a slow heartbeat. They’re holding a small, intricately carved box, its surface shifting between wood and liquid silver. *"I’ve been waiting,"* they say, but their eyes flicker with something unreadable—amusement? Warning?

Before you can respond, the music swells, and the crowd parts like water. A procession begins: figures draped in cloaks of living shadow, their faces obscured by masks of polished bone. At their center is a throne made of intertwined vines, and upon it sits a figure you’ve never seen—yet their presence feels *ancient*, like the echo of a name you’ve almost remembered. The crowd murmurs, *"The Keeper of the Threshold."* Your companion’s grip tightens on your arm. *"They’re offering a choice,"* they whisper. *"But the wrong one will unravel the dream."*

The Keeper raises a hand, and the air between you and them *ripples*, like heat off a desert road. A path opens—not in the room, but *inside* it. One leads to a door of black glass, its surface swirling with constellations. The other to a mirror that shows not your reflection, but a version of you standing in a field of wildflowers, laughing with someone you’ve never met.

Your companion’s voice is urgent now. *"Do you want to wake up… or stay?"*

**Dream Themes to Explore (if you’d like):**
- **The Keeper’s Offer:** What does the "choice" represent? (e.g., facing a fear vs. embracing curiosity; reality vs. illusion.)
- **The Companion’s Role:** Are they a guide, a warning, or a part of *you*? (E.g., your conscience, a past/future self.)
- **The Paths:**
  - *Black Glass Door:* Mystery, the unknown, or a literal "waking up" (but is it safe?).
  - *Mirror Path:* Nostalgia, alternate realities, or the fear of missing out on other lives.
- **The Fox/Glitter:** Symbols of playfulness, hidden magic, or something slipping through your fingers.

- What happens if you choose the door?
- Who is the Keeper really?
- Does the companion have a secret?
