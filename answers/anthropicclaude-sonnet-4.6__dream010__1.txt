# The Dream Job Competition

---

You are participating in a competition where the grand prize is your dream job. As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and...

---

...the challenges keep *shifting* every time you think you understand the rules.

The first round takes place in a vast hall made entirely of library shelves that stretch upward into a fog you cannot see the top of. Your task, a judge explains — a tall woman whose face keeps rearranging itself into different people you've known — is to find **the book that contains your best idea.**

You run your fingers along the spines. The titles are written in your own handwriting. *Things You Said But Didn't Mean. The Summer You Wasted. Every Version of Yourself You Abandoned.* You feel a tightening in your chest.

But then — tucked sideways, almost hidden — a small red book with no title. You open it. The pages are blank, but warm to the touch, like something *alive.*

"That one," you say.

The judge nods, and her face finally settles into something kind.

---

The second round is outside, suddenly, on a stage built over water. The audience sits on lily pads extending to the horizon. Your competitor — someone who looks *almost* exactly like you, wearing a slightly better version of your clothes — stands at the opposite podium.

The task: **explain why you deserve this.**

Your competitor speaks first, fluently, beautifully, citing credentials and accomplishments with the confidence of someone who has rehearsed this since birth. The audience applauds. The lily pads ripple.

You open your mouth.

Nothing comes.

The silence stretches. Water laps at the stage. The almost-you smirks.

Then, from somewhere below your ribs, you stop trying to *perform* the answer and instead say something true — something embarrassingly specific and small. About a single moment. A single reason. Something nobody rehearses because nobody thinks it's impressive enough.

The audience doesn't applaud.

They go very quiet.

That feels, somehow, more powerful.

---

The third round doesn't look like a round at all. You're standing in a corridor between two doors, and the judge — now wearing your grandfather's cardigan, though your grandfather is gone and you don't know how the dream knows that — tells you:

**"Behind one door is the job. Behind the other is who you'd become if you took it."**

"Aren't those the same thing?" you ask.

The judge smiles like you've said something wise and something naive simultaneously.

You choose a door.

It opens not onto an office or a stage or a prize, but onto a *morning* — a very ordinary one. Coffee going warm. Light falling at an angle across a desk that is absolutely, recognizably *yours.* Papers with your handwriting. A project half-finished and waiting. The sound of the world outside going about its business while you are here, doing *this.*

And the feeling in the dream — that particular dream-feeling that sometimes carries more truth than waking life allows — is not triumph.

It's something quieter.

**Recognition.**

Like arriving somewhere you didn't know you'd been traveling toward.

---

You never see the other competitor again. You never get a trophy or a handshake or a formal declaration of victory.

You just sit down at the desk.

You pick up the pen.

And the dream, satisfied, begins to loosen at the edges — the way good dreams do when they've finished telling you what they came to say — and you start to rise slowly, slowly toward morning, carrying the feeling with you like something cupped carefully in both hands.

*Don't spill it,* some part of you thinks.

*Don't wake up too fast.*
