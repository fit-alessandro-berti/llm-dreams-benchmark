...freeze. Your hands hover over the keyboard, but the keys have rearranged themselves into hieroglyphs that swim like fish when you try to focus. The project brief was whispered to you in a meeting that happened in reverse; you remember agreeing to it, but your mouth tasted of static electricity when you said "yes."

Your boss is still waiting, but now they're sitting inside your monitor, their face tiled across four different application windows. They're not blinking. They never blink in dreams. "Just need the quantum funnel integrated with the legacy system by 4 p.m.," they say, and their voice comes from the coffee mug on your desk, which is somehow also your phone. When you pick it up, it's ringtones are spreadsheets.

You try to explain that you don't know what a quantum funnel *is*, but your tongue has turned into a dry sponge. The deadline was 4 p.m., but the clock only shows times from next Tuesday, and each minute that passes adds three more deliverables to the project. Your coworkers are all mannequins with post-it notes for faces, furiously typing on machines made entirely of blue light and regret. Their keyboards work fine.

You open a file, but inside are just thousands of copies of your own signature, each one slightly more illegible than the last. The boss is now standing behind you, but also somehow still inside the monitor. You can feel their breath, which smells like printer toner and missed opportunities. "We're all counting on you," they say, and their words physically manifest as paperclips that chain your wrists to the desk.

The screen flickers. The deadline was 4 p.m., but it's always 4 p.m., forever, in dreams.
