...and I realize it is the only object in this realm that holds its form. Around me, the sky ripples like disturbed water, shifting from bruised violet to blinding white, and the ground beneath my feet alternates between soft moss and cold, geometric steel. But the canvas remains a pristine, steady rectangle of absolute silence.

I reach out, and a brush materializes in my hand—its handle made of drifting smoke, its bristles sparkling like a constellation of tiny stars. I don't dip it into a palette; instead, I swipe it through the air, catching a trailing ribbon of turquoise mist that floats by like a stray ribbon.

As I touch the brush to the canvas, the surface doesn't resist. It drinks the color. The turquoise doesn't just sit there; it spirals outward, creating a depth that shouldn't exist. I paint a line of screaming orange, and it hums with a low vibration, detaching from the canvas to float in the air beside my head like a glowing snake.

I realize then that the canvas isn't for capturing the world; it is for stabilizing it. Everything I paint becomes real and solid, anchoring the chaos. I paint a horizon, and the churning sky above me calms, settling into a gentle, breathable blue. I paint a door, and it swings open on the canvas, revealing not the back of the frame, but a quiet, sunlit room that smells of old books and rain.

Without hesitation, I press my hand against the painted wood. The paint is wet and warm, pulsing like a heartbeat. I push, stepping out of the shifting, surreal nightmare and into the quiet room of my own creation, leaving the chaotic world to dissolve behind me in a whisper of grey.
