Here's my favorite part of our dreams: imagine that we're running through each other, like two people who all want to succeed and compete to see that they come out on top! It looks a bit like this:

1. On your first day in competition, you are standing at the start stand, ready for whatever challenges you face during the course of the event.

2. You find yourself facing a group meeting with everyone who is trying to catch up with you. In front of the people waiting for them, there are two prizes that you're all competing against each other: 

   The first prize consists of $50 for first place and 10% off your overall salary if you succeed in getting third position (the group's top three candidates)
   The second prize includes a chance to win the grand prize if you can complete an exceptionally long interview with the last candidate. It also costs £30, which is similar to what your salary would be.

3. You're on track, but I was expecting you to be a few minutes late or not as busy as you were going and now it's about halfway through the event time frame.

So in summary: you stand with 5 people - both participants who are trying everything against each other until they achieve their goal of getting first position for your dream job!
