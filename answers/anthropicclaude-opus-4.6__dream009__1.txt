# The Cartographer's Compass

I wake up face-down in wet grass, the taste of copper on my tongue.

The first thing I notice is the silence — not the silence of a quiet room, but a *living* silence, thick with cricket song and wind through unfamiliar trees and the distant complaint of livestock. No electrical hum. No traffic. No planes overhead threading their white scars across the sky.

I sit up. My clothes are wrong. Not mine. Rough-spun wool that itches against my forearms, a leather vest that smells of wood smoke and something animal. My hands — my hands look like mine, but the calluses are different. Writer's calluses replaced by something harder, earned.

A medieval village stretches before me down a hillside, all thatched roofs and mud-packed walls and chimney smoke curling into a sky so impossibly blue it looks *painted*.

I realize I need to **find water**.

Not philosophically. Not existentially. My throat is a desert. My body — this body — hasn't drunk anything in what feels like a dangerously long time.

I stumble downhill toward the sound of a stream, passing a woman hanging laundry who looks at me with an expression I can't quite read — recognition mixed with something cautious, like she's watching a dog that has bitten before.

"Morning, Aldric," she says carefully.

So I have a name here. And apparently a reputation.

The stream is clear and cold and tastes like the earth itself is offering me something precious. As I drink, I catch my reflection — a stranger's face, weathered, maybe thirty-five, a scar bisecting the left eyebrow. Eyes that are still somehow *mine*.

"There you are." A voice behind me. A boy, maybe twelve, carrying a leather satchel too large for his frame. "You said you'd teach me today. The maps."

Maps. I look down at my hands again, at those strange calluses, and suddenly understand their shape — the grip of a quill, the pressure of a straightedge.

I'm a cartographer. In a world where the edges of maps still read *here be dragons*.

"Right," I say slowly, because the boy is watching me with such desperate hope that I can't bear to disappoint him. "The maps."

He opens the satchel, and I see parchments covered in half-finished coastlines, elevation marks drawn in surprisingly careful ink, trade routes annotated in a handwriting I somehow recognize as my own — as *Aldric's*. But there are gaps. Entire regions left blank. And in the margins, frantic notes:

*"The eastern pass does not lead where it should."*
*"Village of Thornfield — cannot be found twice by the same route."*
*"The geography is SHIFTING."*

The last word is underlined three times.

My stomach drops. Because I realize this isn't just a different era. The land itself is wrong — mutable, dreaming its own dream. And I'm the person this village depends on to make sense of a world that refuses to hold still.

"Aldric?" the boy asks. "You've got that look again."

"What look?"

"Like you're somewhere else entirely."

I almost laugh. Instead, I kneel beside him and pick up the quill. It fits my hand perfectly — the calluses receive it like an old friend.

"Lesson one," I say, not knowing where the words come from but trusting them. "A map is not the territory. But sometimes, if you draw it carefully enough..." I trace a line along a blank space, and I swear I feel the ground beneath us *settle*, just slightly, like a held breath released. "...the territory listens."

The boy's eyes go wide.

In the distance, the woman who called me by name has stopped hanging laundry. She's watching us. And her expression has shifted from caution to something else entirely.

*Hope.*

I keep drawing.
