You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **plant a garden in the ruins of an abandoned greenhouse, using salvaged seeds and contaminated soil**. The air hums with the static of old technology, and the sky is a sickly green, but you’ve heard whispers of a forgotten seed bank buried beneath the city. 

You dig through rubble, your hands raw, until you uncover a rusted canister labeled *“Genetic Reserves – Do Not Open.”* Inside, you find a single, iridescent seed, its surface shimmering like liquid metal. Against all logic, you plant it in the cracked earth, water it with rainwater filtered through charred cloth, and wait. 

Days pass. Nothing grows. Then, one morning, a sprout pierces the soil—a delicate, bioluminescent stem that glows faintly in the dark. As it grows, so does something in you: a stubborn, flickering hope. You name the plant *“Eldoria,”* after the lost world you once knew. 

But the dangers don’t disappear. Scavengers track your scent, drawn by the glow. A pack of feral dogs circles your sanctuary, and you must defend it with a crowbar and a stolen flare gun. When the dogs retreat, you realize the plant’s light has repelled them—its glow is a beacon, both inviting and warning. 

You begin to attract others: a wounded engineer, a child with a knack for fixing radios, a former teacher who speaks of stories as if they’re sustenance. Together, you expand the garden, trading seeds for safety, building a fragile community around the light of Eldoria. 

Yet, the dream shifts. The plant’s glow intensifies, warping the air around it. You feel a pull, a whisper in your mind: *“It’s not just a seed. It’s a key.”* The ground trembles. Somewhere beneath the city, something ancient stirs. 

You wake, gasping, the scent of soil still clinging to your fingers.
