Okay, the dream continues...

...you realize you need to **find water.** Not just any water, but *clean* water. The air is thick with the smell of woodsmoke, livestock, and something vaguely unpleasant you can't quite place – maybe unwashed bodies or poor sanitation. You see people drawing water from a muddy-looking river nearby, and others lowering buckets into a stone well in what looks like a town square, but your modern sensibilities scream *danger*.

You walk cautiously through the bustling, chaotic settlement. Buildings are made of rough-hewn timber and daub-and-wattle, leaning at precarious angles. People dressed in coarse, homespun fabrics eye you with open curiosity, their faces weathered and unfamiliar. Their language is a guttural murmur you can't decipher. The lack of plastic, the absence of engine noise, the sheer *earthiness* of everything is overwhelming.

Your throat feels dry, papery. The sun beats down, harsher than you're used to without the filter of smog or tall buildings. Panic begins to prickle at the edges of your mind. How long can you last without safe water? You remember fragmented knowledge – boil water, find a spring. But how do you make a fire without matches? How do you even ask where a spring might be?

Suddenly, you feel an irrational, dream-logic certainty. You need to find **the old woman with the blue cloak.** You don't know how you know this, or who she is, but the image floods your mind: wrinkled face, kind eyes, and a cloak the colour of a deep twilight sky. She, somehow, will have clean water or know where to find it. The need shifts from a basic physical requirement to a quest dictated by the dream itself. Forgetting the impossibility, you start scanning the crowd, ignoring the stares, searching desperately for a flash of impossible blue in this earth-toned world.
