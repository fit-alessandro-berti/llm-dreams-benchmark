You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a swirling, ancient script that shifts and morphs before your eyes, like living tattoos on the paper. The first one reads: "What is the sound of one hand clapping in the key of E minor?" Panic rises as you realize the proctor is a shadowy figure with the face of your childhood pet, whispering encouragements in reverse. You scribble wildly, but your answers turn into feathers that flutter away, carrying your hopes into a suddenly opening skylight. Just as the clock strikes thirteen, the exam paper ignites into a cascade of fireflies, illuminating a hidden door behind the desk. Stepping through, you find yourself in a vast library where bookshelves stretch to infinity, and the real test begins: choosing which volume of your life to rewrite. You wake up with ink stains on your fingers and a strange sense of possibility.
