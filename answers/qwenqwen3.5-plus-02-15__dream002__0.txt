You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and **the air grows heavy, tasting of ozone and ancient pine resin.**

The birds fall silent all at once, as if an invisible hand has muted the world. Above, the canopy of emerald leaves twists into shades of bruised purple and charcoal gray. The wind doesn't just blow; it *inhales*, pulling the fallen leaves upward in a swirling vortex before slamming them back down.

You start to run, but the path beneath your feet begins to shift. The dirt softens into something like warm moss, and the trees seem to lean in, their branches interlocking to form a tunnel that stretches endlessly ahead. Rain begins to fall, but instead of water, it's thousands of tiny, glowing glass beads that chime softly as they hit the forest floor, creating a melody that sounds suspiciously like a song you heard in childhood but can't quite remember.

Suddenly, the thunder cracks—not with a boom, but with the sound of a giant clock ticking backward. Time seems to stutter. You look down at your hands and see them flickering between young and old. The storm isn't trying to hurt you; it's trying to show you something.

In the center of the clearing ahead, a single tree stands untouched by the chaos. Its bark is made of mirror-like silver, and within its reflection, you don't see the storm or the forest. You see a door, slightly ajar, with warm light spilling out onto the wet, chiming ground. The wind pushes you gently toward it, whispering a single word that you understand perfectly, even though it isn't spoken in any human language: *"Remember."*

You reach for the handle, and just as your fingers brush the cool metal, the dream dissolves into the soft hum of your alarm clock.
