You wake up in a village shrouded in mist, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and burning wood. The sky is a bruised purple, and the sun is a faint, pallid disk behind a veil of clouds. Around you, stone cottages lean crookedly, their thatched roofs sagging under the weight of time. A lone blacksmith’s hammer echoes down the cobbled streets, and the distant sound of a fiddle drifts from a tavern where villagers gather in hush, their eyes wary.  

You realize you’re wearing a tunic stained with dirt and a belt of leather, its buckles engraved with unfamiliar symbols. Your hands are calloused, your boots caked in mud—*but where are you?* You stumble toward the edge of the village, where a narrow path leads into a forest of ancient oaks. The trees loom like sentinels, their bark etched with runes you can’t quite decipher.  

A figure approaches—a woman in a woolen cloak, her hair braided with silver threads. She holds a lantern, its flame flickering as if alive. “You’re not from here,” she says, her voice a mix of suspicion and curiosity. “The village is... *alive*.” She gestures to the trees, their branches swaying as if moving of their own accord. “The old ones don’t like strangers.”  

You follow her to a thatched hut at the edge of the woods. Inside, a fire burns, and the walls are lined with brittle scrolls and jars of glowing amber liquid. The woman, named *Elara*, explains that the village exists in a liminal space between eras—a place where the past and present bleed together. Your presence has awakened something. “You need to find the *Waters of Memory*,” she says, handing you a small locket shaped like a key. “They’ll show you where you belong.”  

As you leave, the forest seems to pulse, the trees murmuring in a language you’ve heard before—*a whisper of your own voice, tangled in the echoes of a forgotten life*. You remember nothing of how you got here, but the locket burns warm in your palm, its surface etched with a name: *Elias*.  

The village stares back at you, its people watching in a way that feels both familiar and foreign. You realize you’re not just a visitor—you’re a piece of the puzzle, and the dream is only beginning.
