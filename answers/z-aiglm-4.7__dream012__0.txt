...realize that the waves aren't made of water, but of heavy, shifting velvet. You look down at the compass in your hand, but instead of a needle, it holds a single, unblinking eye that stares back up at you. You want to shout an order to turn the ship, to lower the sails, to do something, but when you open your mouth, no sound comes out—only the rhythmic chiming of a grandfather clock.

The crew, who you suddenly realize are all wearing masks of your own face, stop waiting. They begin to laugh, a sound like tearing paper. You grip the wheel, which is soft and warm to the touch like skin, and turn it sharply upward. The ship groans, the sound of a cello string snapping, and instead of capsizing, it lifts off the surface of the velvet sea. You are flying now, straight up into the storm, where the lightning is actually cracks in a porcelain sky and the rain tastes like sugar. You are no longer afraid; you are weightless, and the storm is just a dance you haven't learned the steps to yet.
