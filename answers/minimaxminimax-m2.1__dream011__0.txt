# The Final Exam

You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language you don't recognize—not completely unfamiliar, but just beyond comprehension, like a word on the tip of your tongue that slips away when you reach for it.

The proctor, a woman with kind eyes and gray-streaked hair, hands you a blue book and a single pencil. "You have three hours," she says, but her lips move in slow motion, and the words arrive in your ears seconds after they've left her mouth.

You flip to the first page. The questions are not questions at all but photographs—polaroids of moments from your life you don't remember living. A childhood bedroom you never had. A conversation you're certain you never had. A version of yourself standing at a crossroads you've never visited, yet somehow know intimately.

The second page contains a single prompt in that half-familiar script: *Explain why you are here.*

Your hand moves across the page without your permission, writing in that same unreadable script. The pencil scratches loudly in the silent room, and you realize the other students—the dozens of them filling the auditorium around you—have all stopped writing. They're watching you. Not with hostility, but with something like recognition, as if you've arrived late to a party that started centuries ago.

You want to ask them what's happening, but your mouth won't open. Your hand won't stop writing. The words flowing from your pencil feel important, essential, like answers to questions you've been asking yourself since before you knew how to ask.

The proctor returns to your desk. She's smiling now, though you can't tell if it's gentle or sad. "Time's almost up," she says, and this time her words arrive perfectly in sync.

You look down at the blue book. The pages are full—not with that strange script anymore, but with your own handwriting, clearly legible, in a language you understand perfectly. It reads like a letter from a stranger who knows you better than anyone. It tells the story of every choice you've made and every path you've declined, every fear you've mastered and every cowardice you've disguised as practicality.

At the bottom of the last page, a question appears where you didn't write it: *Do you want to see the answer key?*

The pencil in your hand snaps in half.

You wake up in your own bed, morning light streaming through the window, heart pounding with the particular relief of having escaped something that was never really a trap at all. But as you lie there, catching your breath, you notice a blue book on your nightstand that you don't remember owning. The cover is embossed in gold letters: *FINAL EXAM—SECOND ATTEMPT.*

You open it.

The pages are blank.

Somewhere, in the space between sleep and waking, you hear the proctor's voice: "You have three hours."
