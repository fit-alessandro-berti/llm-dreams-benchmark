You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and notice a brush hovering in the air before it, waiting.

You take the brush. The moment your fingers close around the handle, the canvas begins to breathe. Its white surface ripples like fabric caught in a gentle wind, and you understand without being told that whatever you paint will become real—not merely depicted, but *born*.

You step through.

The canvas seals behind you, and you find yourself in a room you almost recognize—half your childhood bedroom, half somewhere else entirely. A window shows two moons rising over a city of glass spirals. There's a bed with unfamiliar sheets and a desk where a half-written letter waits, the ink still wet, in your own handwriting.

The drawer is real. It's right there. Your hand finds the handle and pulls, and inside rests a small mirror, its glass dark and rippled.

You lift it to your face, and your reflection blinks back—only it isn't you. Or rather, it is you, but older, younger, and something else entirely, wearing your features like a borrowed coat. It opens its mouth to speak, and the world begins to fade at the edges, the dream unraveling even as you lean closer to hear what it has to say—
