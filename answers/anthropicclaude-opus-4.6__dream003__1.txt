# The Dream of the Locked Box

You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and symbols carved into the dark, ancient wood — spirals that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them, as if the grain itself is breathing.

Your fingers trace the carvings, and where you touch, the wood grows warm. The spirals begin to glow with a faint bioluminescent blue, like deep-sea creatures pulsing in the dark. You realize the patterns aren't decorations — they're a **language**.

Each symbol you press sinks slightly, and a low hum resonates through your bones. The box is asking you something. Not in words. In *feelings*. It wants to know what you're willing to leave behind to see what's inside.

A memory surfaces unbidden — the sound of your childhood home's screen door slamming shut in summer. You let it go. The first lock clicks open.

Then the smell of someone you loved. Released. A second click.

Then your own name. You hesitate. The box waits patiently, infinitely patient, as only dreaming things can be.

You let it go.

The lid opens slowly, breathing out air that tastes like rain on hot pavement. Inside, resting on black velvet, is... **a mirror the size of a playing card.** You pick it up and look into it.

But the face looking back isn't yours — because you just gave your name away, and the person in the mirror has no need for one. They smile at you with enormous compassion, and you understand suddenly that the box was never locked.

*You* were.

The mirror dissolves into warm light between your fingers, and the light spreads up your arms, through your chest, and the box, the room, the walls all become transparent, and behind everything — behind the whole scaffolding of the dream — you glimpse a vast, quiet, **boundless** space that has been there all along, waiting with the patience of an unlocked door.

You step through.

*And somewhere, the box closes gently behind you, ready for the next dreamer.*
