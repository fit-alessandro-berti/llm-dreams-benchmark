...and the noise is a physical thing, a thick, warm syrup of sound that sticks to my skin.

My friend's name is on the tip of my tongue, but it feels like a heavy stone I can't quite lift. The need to find them is an ache in my chest.

The first group I push through is made of people laughing. Their laughter isn't a sound but a cascade of bright, shimmering bubbles that pop against my face, smelling faintly of mint and ozone. I try to ask them, "Have you seen...?" but a particularly large bubble of mirth bursts in my mouth, filling it with silent fizzing. They don't seem to notice me at all, their eyes focused on a joke that hangs, invisible, in the center of their circle.

I stumble away, wiping the phantom fizz from my lips, and the floor beneath my feet softens from polished hardwood into damp, cool moss. The air grows quiet. I'm now near a second group, huddled close together. They aren't talking, but weaving. In their hands are threads of dull, grey light, which they are plaiting into a long, intricate rope. They work with intense, solemn concentration. One of them looks up, their face a perfect, unlined blank, and offers me a thread. It feels cold and heavy, like worry itself. I shake my head and back away, and the thread falls to the mossy ground, where it sinks without a trace.

The geography of the room keeps shifting. A grand staircase spirals down into what now looks like a foggy garden at twilight. I descend, my hand sliding on a banister made of smooth, cool ice that doesn't melt. At the bottom, a third group is gathered around a small, still pond. They are all wearing exquisite masks made of porcelain, each painted with a different, serene facial expression. They hold long-stemmed glasses filled not with wine, but with darkness. As I approach, one of them turns to me. The mask is smiling, but a single, perfect tear traces a path down its cheek.

"You're looking for someone," the mask says, its voice the sound of a distant bell.

"Yes," I say, my own voice feeling rusty and unfamiliar. "My friend. I can't remember their name."

"Names are heavy here," the mask replies, taking a delicate sip of the darkness in its glass. "We let them sink to the bottom. It's kinder." It gestures toward the pond.

I lean over the edge. The water is impossibly clear, and the bottom is littered with shimmering, forgotten names that glint like lost coins. I see "Eleanor," "Samuel," "Asha," "Ben." None of them feel right. The ache in my chest intensifies.

Then, I see a figure sitting on a stone bench on the other side of the pond. Alone. Even from this distance, I know it's them. Relief floods me, so powerful it almost brings me to my knees. The name flies into my mind, light as a feather: *Alex*.

I start to circle the pond, my steps getting faster, almost a run. The mossy ground gives way to cracking pavement, the foggy garden to a stark, empty courtyard. The party and its strange guests have vanished. There is only the courtyard, the bench, and my friend.

"Alex!" I call out, my voice echoing in the sudden silence.

They turn. Their face is a blur at first, but then it sharpens into focus. With a jolt that stops my heart, I realize I am looking at myself.

They—I—smile a sad, tired smile. "I've been looking for you everywhere," my own voice says to me. "I was starting to think I was the only one I knew here."

The ground beneath my feet disappears. The feeling of falling is the feeling of waking up.
