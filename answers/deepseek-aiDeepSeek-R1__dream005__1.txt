**Dream Continuation:**

You weave through the murmuring crowd, the air thick with laughter and clinking glasses. The first group you pass is frozen mid-gesture, their faces blurred like smudged paintings. One turns to you, mouth moving in slow motion, syllables stretching into a low drone. You hurry past, but your name seems to echo from their direction—a sound you can’t place.  

Next, a circle of people in shimmering masks beckons. Their voices overlap in riddles: *“What follows you but dissolves in light?”* A woman’s mask cracks, revealing hollow darkness beneath. You step back, and the group dissolves into smoke, leaving only the scent of burnt sugar.  

Then, a hallway yawns open, lined with doors. Behind one, your friend’s laugh rings out—warm, familiar. You fling it open, only to find a moonlit forest where the gathering should be. A figure stands beneath a tree, their back to you. They turn slowly… but their features shift like melting wax, dissolving into a stranger’s face.  

You jolt awake, the dream’s residue clinging like cobwebs. For a moment, the stranger’s voice—*your* voice—still hums in the room: *“Shadow. The answer was shadow.”*
