You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are **not written in words, but in shifting patterns of light and sound**. The pages of the exam are blank, yet your mind fills them with equations, poems, and diagrams that seem to pulse with life.  

The first question hums in your skull: *"What is the weight of a shadow when the sun has forgotten its name?"* You scribble answers in a language you don’t recognize, your hand moving faster than your thoughts.  

The second question appears as a riddle spoken by the proctor—a tall figure with a face like a melting clock: *"If you could trade one memory for infinite knowledge, which would you choose? And why would the choice haunt you?"*  

As you work, the room around you dissolves. Your desk becomes a boat adrift in a starless sky, and the exam paper is now a flock of birds, each feather inscribed with a question. You realize the test isn’t about answers, but about **letting go of the need to control the outcome**.  

When you finally hand in your "exam," the proctor smiles and says, *"You’ve passed. Now, go wake yourself up before the dream becomes your reality."*  

You wake, gasping, the echo of the questions still ringing in your mind.
