...and obstacles that seem to shift like sand beneath your feet. One moment, you are solving a complex equation on a chalkboard that stretches endlessly into the sky; the next, you are navigating a labyrinth made entirely of ticking clocks, where every wrong turn ages you by a decade in seconds.

The other competitors are faceless shadows, moving with an eerie, fluid grace, while you feel heavy and grounded, your heart pounding a rhythm that echoes louder than the strange music filling the air. Just as you reach the final gateway—a door suspended in a starry void—you realize the last challenge isn't a test of skill or intelligence. It's a mirror.

In the reflection, you don't see yourself as you are now, but as the version of you who already has the job. The reflection smiles, not with triumph, but with relief, and whispers, "You were already qualified; you just needed to believe you could walk through the door."

As you reach out to touch the glass, the surface ripples like water. You step through, not into an office or a studio, but into a moment of pure clarity where the work feels effortless and joyful. The crowd roars, but their voices blend into the sound of your own laughter. You have won, not because you defeated the others, but because you finally recognized your own potential.

Then, just as you are about to accept the trophy—a glowing orb containing your future—the alarm clock buzzes, and the dream dissolves into the soft light of your morning room, leaving behind a lingering sense of confidence and a clear path forward.
