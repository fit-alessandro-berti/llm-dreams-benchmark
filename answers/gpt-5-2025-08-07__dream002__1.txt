and the first thing you notice is how the light forgets itself. The sun smears into graphite and the leaves turn their pale undersides toward the sky as if to read something written there. The birds stop mid-sound, finishing their last notes silently. The air thickens with the scent of wet stone and green, and somewhere in your ribs a barometer tips.

Wind moves through the forest like an animal deciding whether to be seen. It combs the ferns, fingers your sleeves, and then doubles back as if it remembered your name. When it says it—softly, in the gaps between branches—you feel the hair lift on your arms, each follicle a tiny antennae tuning to a frequency you haven’t heard since childhood summers under tin roofs.

The first raindrops are not drops but questions. They land warm, each a single cool syllable along your cheek: Where? Why? Now? You look up and the clouds have braided themselves into a crown, and lightning stitches its bright thread through the gray, hemming the edge between world and weather. The path blurs, and when you lift your foot to take a step, the ground gives like a held breath.

You think about turning back, about searching for shelter, but the storm is not outside you anymore. It is gathering behind your breastbone, packing its suitcases in your lungs, setting a kettle on your heart. When the thunder speaks, it is not a crack but a word you know intimately. It feels like a door you have not opened in years.

You walk on, the trees leaning toward you like elders who want to tell you something before the rain drowns their voices. Moss flashes brighter, a secret lit from within. On the trunk of an old beech, sap beads like polished amber and trembles, not from cold but from anticipation. The forest has the charged quiet of a theater just before the curtain lifts.

Then the rain commits. A great sheet of it drops at once, and you step through as if through a beaded doorway into another room. Inside is a different logic. The puddles reflect not the canopy but a ceiling of stars you are almost sure belong to another hemisphere, another season. The wind, now confident, sculpts your breath into shapes—a bird, a boat, a key you lost when you were ten. You catch the key before it dissolves and turn it in the air. Something in front of you unlocks with a slow, relieving click.

In the clearing that wasn’t there a moment ago, there is a tree with a door. It is made of bark, yes, but also of thunderheads and your grandmother’s laugh and the smooth inner side of a seashell. You put your hand to it and feel the grain running like a river beneath your palm. The handle is warm. When you open it, the storm steps closer, polite as a guest waiting to be invited.

You step inside the tree and find there is only sky, a blue so deep it tastes like plums. The rain is falling upward here, lifting from the ground as mist and clicking into place among the clouds like beads on a string. You realize you can arrange them. You reach up, and your fingers are not fingers but small weather vanes. You tilt your hand and the thunder shifts key. You lift your arms and the lightning unspools into ribbons you can braid. You braid it around your fear until your fear glows and softens and becomes, unexpectedly, a lamp.

When you step back out, you are drenched and light at once. The forest is reverent, as if something sacred has passed through. Frogs begin a low, contented instrument in the ditches. A deer steps from between two birches, its antlers tufted with lichen like old chandeliers. It nods, a movement so slight the raindrops perched there do not fall.

The storm doesn’t end so much as it shifts its weight. The thunder moves off to argue with a far hill. The last rain is a delicate tapping, curious, affectionate. You take off your shoes. Mud rises between your toes, patient and cool. You think of how long the trees have waited here, roots composed and listening, and you realize the storm did not come to break the forest, only to loosen it, to teach it how to grow again where it had stiffened.

By the time the sun finds its manners and returns, the world has been washed in a new grammar. Everything smells like an apology accepted. Spider webs string pearls from twig to twig, extravagant and temporary. The path reappears, not where you left it but where you need it. You feel the storm settle inside you into something domestic: a kettle humming on a stove, a cat circling then sleeping on your lap.

You walk. Your footsteps make small squelching kisses with the earth. Above you, leaves are still dripping, and each drop, as it falls, contains a window where for an instant you see faces you love, houses you have lived in, doors you did not open and might still. You carry the braided lightning in your pocket; when you touch it, your fingers tingle and you remember how to be brave without clenching.

At the edge of the forest, the sky rinses itself clear. The air tastes like coins and oranges. You step into a light that seems to have been specifically waiting for you, and as it warms your damp shoulders you understand: the storm was not a warning but an arrival. It found you because you were ready to be found.

You look back once. The trees lift their hands. The storm lifts its face. You lift your own, and the three of you, old friends, nod to one another and let the day begin.
