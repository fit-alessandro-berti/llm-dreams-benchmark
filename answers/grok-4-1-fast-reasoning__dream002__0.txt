You feel a storm approaching and the sky darkens to an unnatural bruised purple. Thunder rumbles like the growl of some ancient beast hidden in the canopy. You quicken your pace, branches whipping at your face as the first fat drops of rain—or are they tears from the sky?—splatter around you.

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning cracks open the heavens, illuminating a massive, glowing tree ahead that wasn't there moments before. Its trunk pulses with veins of electric blue light, and as you stumble toward it for shelter, the ground shifts beneath your feet. Roots erupt like welcoming arms, forming a staircase spiraling upward into the tree's heart.

You climb, heart pounding, the storm raging outside but muffled inside the bark-walls that feel alive, whispering secrets in a language of wind and leaves. At the top, you emerge into a vast hollow chamber where the storm's fury swirls in a contained vortex—a beautiful, terrifying maelstrom of colors: emerald winds, sapphire rain, and crimson thunder.

In the center floats a shimmering orb, humming with your name. You reach out, and it bursts into a cascade of memories—not yours, but echoes of forgotten dreams: flying with phoenixes over candy-cloud mountains, dancing with shadow-wolves under starlit seas. Laughter bubbles up from your chest, pure and wild.

Then, the storm quiets. The orb dims, and the tree gently lowers you back to the forest floor. The sun breaks through, birdsong returns, and the peaceful woods feel... changed. Deeper. Yours.

You wake with a smile, the scent of rain lingering on your skin. What a dream.
