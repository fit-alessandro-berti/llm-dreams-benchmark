You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to blend in fast—or risk being labeled a witch, a spy, or worse, a madman from the stars. The air hums with the clatter of horse-drawn carts and the distant toll of a church bell, and the cobblestone streets of this 18th-century port town reek of salt, fish, and unwashed wool. Your jeans and sneakers have been swapped for a threadbare linen shirt and breeches that itch like a penance, courtesy of whatever dream-logic dumped you here.

Heart pounding, you duck into a bustling tavern called The Salty Gull, where grizzled sailors nurse tankards of ale and swap tales of ghost ships. A barmaid with a scar across her cheek eyes you suspiciously as you fumble for words in an accent that feels all wrong. "Coin for a story, stranger?" she grunts, sliding a mug your way. You realize your wallet's gone—replaced by a leather pouch with a single tarnished shilling. Desperate, you spin a yarn about a far-off land of iron birds and glowing boxes that talk, passing it off as a sailor's fever dream. The crowd roars with laughter, then quiets as one old salt leans in: "Lad, that sounds like the Devil's own whisper. Best learn the ropes quick, or the Inquisition'll have ye for supper."

By dusk, you've bartered your "exotic" knowledge for a spot on a merchant vessel bound for the colonies—teaching the captain's boy knots in exchange for passage. But as the ship creaks out to sea under a blood-orange sky, the stars above twist unnaturally, forming patterns that spell your name in electric blue. A storm brews, not of rain, but of flickering screens and dial-up screeches echoing from the waves. You grip the rail, whispering, "This can't be real," just as a massive wave crests—not water, but code, binary rain cascading down.

You jolt awake in your bed, phone buzzing on the nightstand with a low-battery warning. The dream clings like damp salt on your skin, and for a moment, you swear you hear the toll of that church bell in the hum of the air conditioner. What era will it be next time?
