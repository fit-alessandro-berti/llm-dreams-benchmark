…accept their offer, falling in step with the little procession as it weaves through the maze‑like streets.  
The strangers move with uncanny ease, slipping between swirling crowds and glowing market stalls. Their clothes change color whenever they pass under a new light: first emerald, then amethyst, then gold. One of them—an elderly woman with laugh‑lined eyes—hands you a steamed bun that tastes of childhood summers. Another—a lanky teenager whose headphones leak soft piano notes—points out graffiti arrows you never noticed, each one guiding you farther from the noise and deeper into a hushed pocket of the city.

A curved alley opens onto a stairway no taller than your own heartbeat. You climb, and the concrete dissolves into clouds. Suddenly you are walking across a bridge made of street‑sign fragments and subway tickets. Cars rumble below like distant thunder, yet the air around you is serene.

At the bridge’s center rises a small glass kiosk. Inside, the strangers invite you to look through a battered coin‑operated viewer. When you press your eye to the lens, the city rearranges itself into a giant compass: skyscrapers form the cardinal points, and every glowing window becomes a direction only you can read. You realize the compass needle is synchronized with your pulse. The strangers nod, wordlessly urging you to trust it.

You turn the viewer toward the horizon, and there—beyond the tallest towers—you glimpse a quiet harbor bathed in sunrise hues. Warmth floods your chest: that harbor is “home,” though you have never seen it before.

You thank the strangers, but they are fading like watercolor in rain. As your vision blurs, their voices combine into a single whisper: “You already carry the map.”

The bridge drifts apart, the compass folds inward, and you wake—still tasting steamed bun, still hearing soft piano—certain of the next step you need to take.
