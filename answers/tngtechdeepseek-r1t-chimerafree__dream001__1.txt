You start to run through the winding streets, your breath ragged, glancing at the flickering numbers on your wristwatch—each time you check, the hands spin faster. The skyscrapers around you lean inward, their shadows stretching like claws. A neon sign flashes "MEETING THIS WAY," but when you follow it, the arrow melts into gibberish.  

You fumble for your phone, but the screen pulses with static, addresses morphing into hieroglyphs. A stray cat with too many eyes brushes your leg and hisses, "Take the third train to nowhere." Desperate, you sprint toward a subway station, only to find the stairs spiraling endlessly downward.  

The clock ticks louder, now echoing in your bones. A faceless crowd parts to reveal a towering glass building—your destination. Relief floods you as you burst into the lobby… but the room is empty, save for a single balloon drifting upward, bearing the words "TOO LATE."  

You wake, heart pounding, the ghost of the city still pressing against your eyelids.
