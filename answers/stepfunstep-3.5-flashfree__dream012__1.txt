...steady the helm with a grip of iron. The deck heaves beneath your boots, a living, breathing beast of churning black water and screaming wind. Rain slashes sideways, stinging the eyes, and the *Maelstrom's* mainmast groans like a dying thing.

"**HOLD!**" your voice isn't a shout; it's a blade cutting through the gale's roar, raw and absolute. You don't look at the sky's fury. You look at the compass, its trembling needle fighting the magnetic scream of the storm. You look at the crew—young Tom's knuckles white on the foresail line, old Mara's face a map of scars and resolve, the bosun's eyes locked on your hands.

"**NOW!**" You call the orders, each one a precise act against chaos. "**Mara, ease the tops'l! Tom, on the downhaul!**" The crew moves not as individuals, but as the single, pulsing heart of the ship. They are your limbs. The *Maelstrom* is your will given form.

A monster wave, a mountain of green-black water, looms astern. For a heart-stopping second, the world is just that wall of death. You bear the helm hard to starboard, turning the ship into the oncoming sea. The hull shudders as it meets the wave, a concussion of timber and thunder. Water crashes over the forecastle, but you hold the line. You *feel* the ship answer—the groan of the keel, the bite of the rudder, the way the prow claws its way up the face of the wave and over the crest.

As you plunge into the trough beyond, the world is just as violent, but the rhythm has changed. You have met the storm's fist with a wall of oak and sail.

The worst of it breaks over you, and for a moment, the rain is merely rain, the wind merely wind. You are drenched, salt-caked, muscles screaming, but your eyes are clear.

You look at your crew, soaked and spent, standing their posts. A slow, fierce smile breaks across your face, wild and unbothered.

"**That's how we weather it!**" you roar, not with triumph, but with simple, undeniable fact. "**She's a good ship. And we're better. Stand to!**"

The storm still rages. But now, it rages *against* a crew that knows its captain, and a captain who knows his ship. The worst is past. The long, hard fight back to calm begins. You take one hand off the wheel, just for a second, to wipe the seawater from your eyes and see the first, faint, grey lightbeginning to bleed into the eastern margin of the storm.
