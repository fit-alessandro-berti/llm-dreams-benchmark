...speak, but the sound that leaves my lips isn't words. It’s a low, resonant hum that vibrates through the floorboards beneath my feet. 

As the sound grows, the wooden podium beneath my hands begins to soften, turning into cool, dark water that flows over the edge of the stage. The audience doesn't look surprised; they lean forward, their faces blurring into soft smudges of light, like stars reflected in a lake.

I realize then that I am not wearing a suit or a dress, but a cloak woven from the very shadows of the room. I reach into my pocket to find my notes, but instead, I pull out a handful of polished river stones. Each stone glows with a memory I didn't know I had. 

I toss the first stone into the crowd. Instead of hitting the floor, it hangs in the air, expanding into a vivid holographic window showing a forest I visited in a childhood I never lived. The audience sighs—a single, collective breath that smells like ozone and dry pine needles.

I begin to dance, though my feet never leave the ground. With every movement, the auditorium walls peel away like layers of wet paper, revealing that the stage is actually a raft drifting down a river made of liquid mercury. The sky above is a deep, bruised purple, crowded with three moons that are all whispering the same secret in a language I suddenly understand perfectly.

"The speech is finished," I say, and this time my voice is a choir of bells. 

The crowd stands as one, but as they rise, they dissolve into a thousand white birds. They take flight, the rush of their wings sounding like a standing ovation, and I am lifted with them, rising toward the moons until the stage is just a tiny, flickering candle in the dark world below. 

Then, the air turns to silk, the light fades to gray, and I am drifting... drifting... until the silence becomes the hum of a waking world.
