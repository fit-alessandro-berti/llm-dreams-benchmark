you feel the canvas looking back at you, like an eye with its lid closed. A breeze that smells like rain and cinnamon curls around your fingers, urging them forward. When you touch the surface, it’s cool and humming, as if a distant orchestra is tuning up inside the fabric.

Your fingertip leaves no mark at first. Then the canvas inhales.

A ripple spreads out from your touch—quiet at the center, kaleidoscopic at the edges—pulling color from the air like thread from a cloud. Hues gather, pooling into a slow whirl: cobalt sighs into lavender, then shivers into gold. Shapes arrive as if remembering themselves—triangles blink into petals; squares yawn into windows; circles open like songs. The canvas becomes a lake, a sky, a doorway, all at once.

You lean in. The hallway of changing geometry stretches deeper than it should, stairs melting into vines, archways rearranging into constellations that pronounce your name without sound. A small moth with stained-glass wings flutters out, lands on your wrist, and writes a soft question into your pulse. You answer by breathing, and that’s enough—the doorway unfurls.

Inside, you find a room that contains every room you’ve ever left in a hurry. The light switches are feathers. The clocks are sleeping cats. On the far wall, a second canvas hangs, blank and radiant, like a pause between heartbeats. The two canvases regard each other across the room; a hush enters, gentle but absolute.

You step between them and feel thin, like a page being turned.

From above, a brush descends, held by no hand you can see. It hovers at your temple, then dips, and suddenly the bristles are your hair, the handle your spine. You are the brush. The world is the paint. When you move, you lay rivers; when you pause, forests grow in the silence. Your laughter sprinkles into stars.

You paint a door by drawing its absence and walk through it. On the other side is a shore where the waves are made of whispering letters, washing up words you have longed for but never found the right mouth for. You gather them like shells, hold them to your ear. They hum with the temperature of promises kept.

The sky flips, revealing its underbelly: a soft grid of heartbeat lines. Each beat is a lantern. Each lantern contains a tiny you, waving. You wave back and the lanterns drift closer, nesting in your chest. Warmth. Bell-like.

A figure approaches across the tide of letters, changing shape with each step—sometimes an old friend, sometimes a future you, sometimes the thing you almost became. When it stops in front of you, it is a chair. You sit. It becomes a tree. You grow leaves of memory and fruit of possibility. The fruit drops with a sound like a key entering a lock you never saw before.

Behind you, the first canvas—the one that inhaled—exhales. A wind passes through everything, rearranging nothing, clarifying it all. The colors settle, vivid and sure, as if the world has chosen its outfit for the day.

The moth returns and perches on your shoulder. “Ready?” it asks without speaking.

You nod. Together you step back to the canvas, to the seam where the painted world and the seeing world fold into each other. You press your hand to the surface. This time it leaves a print, not of lines and whorls, but of a small door with a knob shaped like a moon.

You turn it. The door opens to the inside of your eyelids, warm and reddish, pulse-lit. As you walk through, the dream taps you lightly on the back, a friendly nudge.

Remember, it murmurs, as the changing colors dim into the gentle dark, you can repaint the morning.
