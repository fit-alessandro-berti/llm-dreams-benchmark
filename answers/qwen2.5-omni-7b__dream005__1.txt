strangers who seem to be having a great time. You feel out of place and unsure of how to approach anyone.

Suddenly, you notice someone in the distance who looks familiar but you can't quite place them. You start walking towards them, hoping that they will recognize you first.

As you get closer, you realize it's your old friend from high school! You're overjoyed and excited to catch up with them after all these years.

You both share stories about your lives since then, laughing and reminiscing about old memories. It feels like old times again as you reconnect with an old friend in a new setting.

After catching up for a while, you decide to head back to your group and continue enjoying the party. But now you have a newfound sense of belonging and connection, knowing that there are still people out there who care about you and want to connect with you.
