The wind shrieks like a banshee, tearing at my coat as I grip the ship’s wheel. Rain lashes my face in icy needles, and the *Siren’s Hope* groans beneath me—a timbered beast straining against the ocean’s fury. Waves rise like black mountains, slamming into the hull with thunderous crashes. Below deck, the cargo shifts; a scream echoes from the bowels of the ship. My first mate, Elias, stumbles to the stern, saltwater streaming down his face. “Captain!” he shouts over the chaos. “The mast’s splitting! We’ll capsize if we don’t—”  

I don’t hear the rest. My eyes lock on the horizon—not the endless void I expected, but a single point of light, impossibly distant. It pulses like a heartbeat. And then I *feel* it: the storm isn’t natural. The sea isn’t angry. It’s *listening*.  

The realization hits me like a grounding shock. This isn’t weather. It’s a dream. My dream. And the storm? It’s my own chaos—every doubt, every whispered fear from the crew, every sleepless night I’ve buried deep. The ship shudders again. Elias’s face twists with terror. The wheel spins wildly in my hands, but I close my eyes.  

*This is your mind. Bend it.*  

I breathe slowly. The wind’s howl softens to a murmur. The rain lessens to a mist. When I open my eyes, the waves have stilled. Not calm, exactly—they ripple like silk, each crest catching the faint glow of that distant light. The *Siren’s Hope* floats calm as a cradle. Elias stares, mouth open, as the deck beneath him steadies.  

I turn to the crew. Their faces are washed clean of fear, but their eyes hold the weight of everything I’ve carried: the broken promises, the battles fought alone, the love I haven’t let myself grieve. They don’t look at my uniform or my sword. They look *at me*.  

“Shove off the damp sails,” I say, voice quiet but firm. “We sail with the breath, not the roar.”  

And as the first light catches the water, I see it—the shore ahead isn’t land. It’s a mirror. A reflection of myself, standing barefoot on silent sand, watching the sea dissolve into stars. The crew follows, not in fear, but in wonder.  

For the first time in years, I am not drowning. I am floating. And the storm was never outside me at all.  

*—And then I wake, the sheets tangled around me, the ceiling fan humming softly. But the calm remains. It always does.*
