a paintbrush that seems to hum with energy. As you reach for it, the brush leaps into your hand, and suddenly, the canvas ripples like water.  

You dip the brush into the air itself, and where it touches, vibrant hues bleed into existence—colors you’ve never seen before, shifting like liquid light. With each stroke, the world around you responds: the sky pulses in harmony, trees twist into geometric fractals, and the ground beneath you softens into a swirling mosaic.  

A voice, neither loud nor quiet, whispers from nowhere and everywhere:  
*"Paint what you fear, and it will fade. Paint what you love, and it will stay."*  

As you raise the brush again, the dream trembles—waiting for your next move.  

What do you paint?
