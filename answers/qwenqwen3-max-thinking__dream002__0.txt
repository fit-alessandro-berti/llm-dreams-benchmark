...the air grows heavy, thick with the scent of ozone and damp earth. The once-gentle rustle of leaves turns frantic, as if the trees themselves are whispering warnings. Overhead, the sky bruises from twilight blue to an ominous violet-black, and a distant thunderclaps echoes like a giant’s drumbeat.

You quicken your pace, searching for shelter, but the familiar forest path twists and narrows, branches snagging at your sleeves like grasping fingers. Rain begins—not gentle drops, but icy needles that sting your skin and blur your vision. Lightning forks across the sky, illuminating something ahead: a crumbling stone archway half-swallowed by ivy, glowing faintly with an eerie, silver light.

Driven by instinct, you duck beneath it just as the storm breaks in earnest. Inside the archway isn't more forest—but a vast, silent library. Endless shelves spiral upward into darkness, lit by floating orbs of soft blue flame. The rain and thunder vanish instantly, replaced by the hush of turning pages and the scent of old parchment and cedar.

A book on a nearby lectern flutters open on its own. Its pages are blank—except for a single sentence that appears in shimmering ink as you approach:

*"You've been here before. Remember the key?"*

Your hand drifts to your pocket. Your fingers close around something cold and metallic—a key you don’t recall picking up. It hums faintly, warm now against your palm, as if recognizing the library… or the storm outside wasn’t the danger at all. The real storm is waking up.
