**Dream Continuation:**  

The air in the room thickens, the scent of old books and pine from the ceiling fan mingling with the metallic tang of unspoken words. You’re sitting cross-legged on the worn rug, your friend’s back to you as they pace like a caged animal. The golden hour light slants through the window, casting long shadows that twist like serpents across the floor. Your voice cracks first, sharp and raw: *“You can’t just leave. What if I don’t want to say goodbye?”*  

They turn, hands gripping the edge of the coffee table so hard the ceramic vase trembles. Their eyes—usually warm, now hardened—lock onto yours. *“I’m not leaving. I’m *growing*,”* they snap, the word *“growing”* dripping with something you’ve never heard before: defiance. *“Staying here means stagnating. You’re holding me back.”*  

The accusation hits like a physical blow. You leap up, the rug tearing under your feet as you grab their wrist. Your nails dig in, pain flaring as you hiss, *“You’ve been lying to me since day one! Every ‘us against the world’ story was a excuse—”*  

Then the room *shakes*. The walls hum, as if the very structure is recoiling. The clock on the mantel melts into liquid gold, dripping onto the floor. Your friend’s face flickers—once a child’s grin, now twisted into a stranger’s mask. *“You’re the one who’s afraid,”* they whisper, but their voice sounds distant, like it’s coming from a different room. *“You’re the one who can’t let go.”*  

The air turns icy. Your breath fogs in front of you as the rug unravels into threads of light, pulling you backward into a void. You claw at the threads, but they slip through your fingers like smoke. When you look down, your hands are empty, the friend gone. Only the melting clock remains, pooling into a puddle that reflects not your face, but a crowd of strangers—the people you’ve never met but somehow feel intimately familiar to.  

You wake with a gasp, sunlight slicing through the blinds. The room is quiet, the clock ticking normally. Your throat is raw, and the rug still smells of pine and old ink. Outside, the sky is a bruised purple, as if the world itself has held its breath. You don’t know if you’ll call them. Or if you’ll ever speak of this again.  

The dream lingers, a ghost in your chest—half pain, half something else: the terrifying, thrilling edge of *change*, and the fear that sometimes, the hardest choices are the ones we avoid until the moment they’re too late.
