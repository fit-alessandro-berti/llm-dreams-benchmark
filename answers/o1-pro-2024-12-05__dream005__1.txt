...each group has its own mood, its own peculiar shape, as if the air around them warps slightly with their laughter or their tense whispers.

First, you pass a group clustered around a long wooden table lit by candlelight—although you notice there are no candles, just the soft glow emanating from their fingertips. They’re all wearing silky scarves and tall hats. A man with a green scarf and a feathered hat beckons you closer. He never stops smiling. As you approach, his eyes seem to reflect your face back at you a thousand times, like tiny mirrors. You realize he’s asking your name, but his voice comes through in a language you don’t recognize. You attempt to respond, but the moment you open your mouth, a soft hum fills the space, and the group—one by one—fades away. The table and their strange hats remain floating for just an instant, then collapse into a single point of light that zips off overhead.

You shake your head, trying to locate some anchor of reality. You walk on, and the music changes. The next group is gathered around a small, makeshift stage. A trio of violinists plays a tune that sounds like wind chimes trapped in a snowstorm. Around them, people sway in slow-motion dance, each wearing old-fashioned attire as if they stepped out of a photograph from a century ago. When you try to slip past, a dancer twirls close and grabs your hand, spinning you into their circle. You see their faces blur at the edges and realize they are somehow laughing and weeping at the same time. You feel your heart pounding, and you politely break away, apologizing soundlessly because no words will form.

You continue through the gathering and enter a cavernous hall. At the far end, you think you glimpse the person you came here to find—their jacket’s distinctive pattern shimmering near a column. You push through a crowd dressed in shimmering gold, their eyes all focused on something above them. You follow their gaze and see something hovering: A large, glowing orb gently pulsates as if breathing. It casts shifting patterns on everyone’s faces, making them look like living mosaics. These people seem calm, serene, as if half-asleep. They don’t speak. They simply watch the orb change colors and hum softly. You try to speak to them, to ask if they’ve seen your friend, but it’s as though you can’t fully cross into their reality. Your voice feels thin and distant, your words scattering like leaves before they reach anyone’s ears.

You move on, more determined now. You feel the texture of the floor changing beneath your feet—from cold tile to plush carpet to something like moss. Your nose picks up scents that shift with each new group you encounter. The low hum of conversation becomes a strange chorus of half-familiar melodies. You turn a corner and find yourself in a dim corridor lined with floor-to-ceiling curtains. Behind each curtain you hear muffled voices, see silhouettes passing behind the cloth. You gently pull one curtain aside, only to find an empty space filled with a gentle twilight glow. A soft breeze, impossibly, drifts past you and carries the faint sound of your name, spoken tenderly. Startled, you let the curtain fall, and continue on.

At last, you emerge into a more familiar setting—a rooftop garden. Lanterns sway from delicate strings, and the sound of distant traffic reminds you this could be a city after all. And there, near a railing wrapped in ivy, you see your friend. They turn to face you, and their smile is both welcoming and knowing. They don’t say a word, just offer their hand. The two of you stand quietly together, the distant murmur of the gathering below now just a memory drifting away on a warm night breeze. As you touch their hand, the world softens and begins to dissolve. Shapes fold inward, colors swirl, and everything becomes a gentle whisper. You wake up feeling as though you’ve just returned from a journey beyond sound and sight, still carrying the quiet warmth of their smile.
