…and the first low growl of thunder rolls through the treetops like a giant turning in its sleep. Leaves quiver; the air thickens as if it has decided to become water before it falls. You hurry along the moss‑padded path, but the forest is shifting: trunks stretch taller, their bark braiding into towering spires, and between them new corridors open, glowing with phosphorescent blues and greens.

A silver flash splits the sky, and in its brief, electric light you glimpse a stag made of cloud and starlight standing directly in your path. Its antlers crackle with miniature lightning. Instead of running, you feel pulled toward it. Rain begins—warm, heavy drops that smell of salt like a rising tide. Each drop that strikes the leaves turns to crystal, chiming softly as it lands on the ground, forming a glittering mosaic behind you.

The stag bows its head and a path of light unfurls from its hooves, winding deeper into the forest. You follow, and the storm seems to swirl around but never touch the glowing track. Wind howls overhead, bending trees into arches that frame your passage. At the path’s end waits a small, mirror‑still pond ringed with moonlit stones. Although the sky above churns, the pond reflects a tranquil, star‑filled night.

The stag steps onto the water, becomes a constellation, and scatters upward. You kneel, touch the pond, and the surface rises like a sheet of glass, showing you your own face, calm and unafraid. The thunder fades into a distant heartbeat. With a deep breath, you step through the reflection, feeling cool starlight wrap around you like silk.

On the other side there is no storm, only endless sky painted in dawn colors. You realize the forest, the rain, even the lightning were your own restless thoughts—and waking, you carry with you the hush of that boundless horizon.
