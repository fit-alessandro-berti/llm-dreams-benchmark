...and suddenly, you realize the storm isn't just rain—it's alive. Dark clouds swirl like ink from an overturned bottle, forming eerie shapes that whisper your name in forgotten languages. The trees bend and groan, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. You sprint for shelter, your heart pounding, but the path ahead dissolves into a swirling vortex of mist and lightning. As thunder crashes, you stumble upon an ancient tree with a glowing hollow. Inside, a figure beckons—an ethereal guide who says, "The storm tests the wanderer; seek the eye to find your truth." Do you enter, or turn back into the chaos? The choice echoes in your mind, pulling you deeper into the unknown.
