You step forward, arms outstretched, and the strangers materialize—each a mosaic of light and shadow, their faces aglow with an unspoken warmth. They lead you past a tangle of neon-lit alleyways, where fountains mock ocean waves and streetlights hum lullabies. One whispers, *"Every city has a pulse, but it’s often buried where the heart walks."* Another lifts a crumpled map unfurling from their sleeve, charting not streets, but moments of connection: a barista who remembers your order, a dog’s wagging tail at noon, the way the wind carries a melody only you once knew.  

As they guide you deeper, the crowd thins, and you notice a hidden stairwell spiraling upward, vanishing where sunlight breaks. The strangers nod—not expectantly, but with quiet approval. You pause, realizing the map isn’t about reaching a place, but *inheriting* a map within yourself. When you reach the top, a new sky unfolds—a city that gleams, not with brightness, but with the soft friction of shared humanity. The strangers vanish, leaving only a single lantern balancing on your shoulder, its glow steady.  

When you wake, the next morning finds you wandering the real city, and you see them everywhere: a stranger laughing with a stranger, a book-sharing duo, a child who lights a shared candle. The dream lingers—not as a resolution, but as a thread connecting all lives. You smile, unencumbered, knowing now you’re never alone.
