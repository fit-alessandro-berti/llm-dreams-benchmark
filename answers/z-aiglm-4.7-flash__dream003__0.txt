intricate patterns and *subtle, rhythmic breathing*.

The box is warm to the touch, radiating a faint heat that isn't uncomfortable, but rather present—like a living thing that has curled up in your palm to sleep. As you lean in closer, you realize the patterns aren't carved into the surface; they are etched in light that shifts like shifting sand. When you finally run your thumb over the center of the design, it doesn't feel like metal or wood. It feels like skin.

The box softens under your grip, dissolving into a thick, warm liquid that spills over your hands and begins to cover the floor. It smells of ozone and rain. Slowly, the liquid pulls itself together, refusing to soak into the ground, and begins to rise. It spirals upward, knotting itself into a perfect sphere of solid light that hovers just above your head. It pulses once—slow, heavy, and loud—like a heartbeat from another world, before fading into the night, leaving you holding a single, perfect drop of water that is still suspended in the air, refusing to fall.
