…begin to realize the puzzles aren’t just tests of logic—they’re memories.

Each corridor flickers as you solve it: a child’s birthday candle blowing out, your mother’s voice whispering *“Try again, sweetheart,”* a final exam room where time slowed to syrup, your own face in a mirror, older, wearing a coat you don’t remember buying.

The air hums with static, like a half-heard lullaby. The walls are made of shifting equations, handwritten letters from people you’ve lost, stained with tea rings and smudged ink. To solve the next puzzle—a spiral of interlocked keys made of light—you must answer not *what* the answer is, but *why* you need it.

You pause before the final chamber. The puzzle here is a blank page. No symbols. No numbers. Just a single sentence etched in vapor:

> *“What did you forget to say to them?”*

Your breath hitches. Your fingers tremble. You don’t cry—you haven’t cried in the dream, not once—but your chest aches like it’s full of swallowed stars.

You reach into your pocket and pull out a crumpled note. You didn’t notice you had it. It reads:

> *“I’m sorry I didn’t stay. I’m sorry I didn’t call. I’m sorry I let you think I didn’t care.”*

You place it on the blank page.

The maze dissolves.

Not into light.

But into silence.

And then—

—a voice. Familiar. Soft.

*“You’re home now.”*

You open your eyes.

You’re lying in a hospital bed.

A monitor beeps.

A hand—wrinkled, cold, but gentle—is holding yours.

And for the first time in twenty years, you remember her name.

> *Mom.*

The maze was never about escape.

It was about remembering enough to come back.
