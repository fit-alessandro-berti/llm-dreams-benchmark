**Dream Continuation:**  

You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **venture into the ruins of an old research facility**, hoping to find technology or supplies that could help you—and perhaps others—survive.  

As you step through the broken doors, the air is thick with dust, and the flickering remnants of emergency lights cast eerie shadows. A rusted terminal hums weakly, its screen displaying fragmented data. You wipe away the grime and see a single word blinking:  

**"REBOOT?"**  

A choice lies before you—do you risk activating it, not knowing what systems might awaken? Or do you move deeper into the facility, where distant mechanical whirring suggests something—or someone—is still operational?  

*(How would you like to proceed?)*
