You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you—

—grip the wheel with hands raw from salt and strain, knuckles white against the thrashing dark. Lightning cracks the sky like shattered glass, illuminating the terror in their eyes for just a heartbeat. The *Mara’s Resolve* groans like a dying beast beneath you; timbers scream, rigging shrieks, and the sea isn’t water anymore—it’s a living thing with teeth.

But you’ve sailed these waters before. Not in body, perhaps, but in the marrow of your bones. Your grandfather’s voice echoes through the howl: *"The storm doesn’t care if you fear it. It only cares if you respect it."*

"Hard to starboard!" you roar over the wind, voice raw but steady. "Jensen—lash that mainsail tighter! Li—get below and check the bilge! NOW!"

They move. Not because you’re infallible, but because your certainty is an anchor in the chaos. You feel the ship shudder as she turns her broadside to the worst of the swell, riding the fury like a prayer. Rain lashes your face, blinding, stinging—but you don’t blink. You *see* the pattern in the madness: the rhythm beneath the rage.

Then—a break. A sliver of moonlight pierces the clouds ahead, glinting off something unnatural in the water. Not wreckage. Not rock. A shape, smooth and dark, gliding just beneath the surface. Larger than a whale. Older than the storm.

The crew freezes, sensing it too. The wind seems to hold its breath.

You meet your first mate’s wide eyes across the deck. No words pass between you. Only understanding: this is no ordinary tempest. And the sea doesn’t just test sailors—it *chooses* them.

You adjust your grip on the wheel, jaw set. "Steady as she goes," you say, quieter now, almost to yourself. "We don’t outrun what’s coming. We sail *through* it."

And as the ship surges forward into the moonlit unknown, the storm doesn’t calm—it *parts*, like curtains drawn for an audience. The crew stands taller. The sea gleams with stars that weren’t there before. And you realize, with a shiver deeper than fear or awe:

*You were always meant to be here.*

The dream isn’t ending. It’s beginning.
