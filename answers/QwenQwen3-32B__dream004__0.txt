...you feel an invisible brushstroke of wind trace the outline of your thoughts. The canvas hums, its surface rippling like liquid mercury, and you realize it’s not empty—it’s *breathing*. As you reach out, your fingertips dissolve into the fabric of the dream, and suddenly, your emotions materialize: a swirl of indigo for your quiet fears, gold for moments of joy you’d forgotten.  

The landscape holds its breath. With each hue you summon, the world reshapes itself—mountains melt into watercolor rivers, and spires of crystalline geometry bloom where you drip violet. But then, a shadow pools in the corner of the canvas, a shape you don’t recognize. It writhes, tendrils stretching toward you, whispering in a language of static.  

You grasp for color to banish it, but the canvas now demands a choice: *What will you trade to finish the painting?* A memory? A dream? A part of yourself? The air thickens as the surreal horizon bends inward, and you wonder—does completing this dream mean losing the one you’re living?  

What do you paint next?
