In the heart of a bustling, unfamiliar city, I found myself in a panic, realizing I had an important meeting in an hour with no idea where it was. I quickly recalled the meeting details from an email by John, locating the address as 345 Riverview Tower, 14th Floor. Determined, I navigated the busy streets, seeking directions from a convenience store clerk who guided me towards the subway. After a tense subway ride, I arrived at Riverfront station, spotting Riverview Tower by the river. With 20 minutes to spare, I sprinted to the tower, reached the 14th floor, and composed myself just in time for the 3:00 PM meeting.
