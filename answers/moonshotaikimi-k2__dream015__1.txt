…build a garden.

Not just any garden—one that grows between the bones of the city. I start with seeds rescued from an abandoned seed-bank vault: wrinkled beans, black tomatoes, millet the color of rust. The soil is thin and sour, shot through with fragments of glass and circuitry, so I soak it in melted snow from the stadium roof, talk to it in the voice my mother used for lullabies. At night, I rig broken stadium lights to flicker on for exactly four hours—enough trickery of daylight to coax cotyledons open without alerting drones that hunt by heat signatures.

By day three, frost-rimmed shoots spear the crust. Children appear first—quiet as cats, their breath fogging the cellophane windows of my little greenhouse (a scavenged metro booth). They don’t ask, only watch. I show them how to press a fingertip into the soil to test moisture, how to tell a weed from a would-be feast. Soon a boy named Hazer brings me a cracked projectile casing; we turn it into a hanging planter for strawberries. His sister, Lace, threads copper wire through bullet-pierced cans, rigs tiny windmills that stir the stagnant air and keep mildew away.

The garden becomes currency. A handful of sprouted lentils buys clean filters for a respirator, a single ripe pepper settles the toll for safe passage down the old sewer tunnels. I trade seedlings like promises. Each leaf that uncurls feels like defiance in chlorophyll form. When the raiders come, engines coughing smoke, they stop at the fence of rebar and rusted bicycles because there, against all reason, are sunflowers taller than their shoulder-mounted weapons. We offer them bowls of fresh pea shoots slick with dew. While they chew, forgetting for sixty seconds to grip their rifles, I whisper the Latin names out loud—Pisum sativum, Helianthus annuus—words older than apocalypse.

We string hacked solar fairy lights overhead. They wink like fallen constellations. Sometimes, wind tunneled through cracked high-rises makes them sing, a soft glass-against-glass lullaby. We hum along and feel time unclench, just for a heartbeat.

I’m dreaming I know—because pollen shouldn’t glow silver against the perpetual dusk, and roots shouldn’t grow so quickly you can watch them inch deeper as you speak. But I keep planting. When the first thunder of the ground-splitting quake sounds, I shove seed packets into children’s pockets, fold their fingers over them as if sealing tiny suns in their palms.

We run. Behind us the city tilts, towers sliding into fissures like ships scuttled at sea. But ahead the hillside is unscarred and smells of wet clay. I fall to my knees, press a seed—one obsidian bean—into the raw earth. The children copy me. Overhead an aurora shaped like a vine unfolds across the iron-colored sky, each leaf a luminous shade of impossible green.

If the world ends again tonight, I think, let it end while something green is still reaching upward.
