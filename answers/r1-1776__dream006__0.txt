**Dream Continuation:**

As you step onto the stage, the weight of silence settles over the crowd. You open your mouth to speak, but your voice reverberates like a chorus, echoing beyond the walls. The audience’s faces ripple, melting into familiar yet indistinct shapes—teachers from childhood, strangers from the subway, a flicker of your reflection in each pair of eyes. 

Your notes dissolve into petals, scattering at your feet. Panic rises, but then you inhale deeply, and the air tastes like starlight. Words pour out, unscripted and electric: *"What if fear is just a shadow of the courage you’ve yet to claim?"* 

The stage beneath you softens into grass. The audience drifts upward, levitating like dandelion seeds, their applause a hum that vibrates in your bones. You leap, and the ground releases you—suddenly you’re soaring above them, your speech now a song that paints the air with colors no one has named. 

A child in the front row catches your gaze. She holds out a mirror. In it, you see yourself, not as you are, but as you might become: radiant, unshaken, a storm of light. 

You wake just as the first note of your next sentence begins—but the melody lingers, humming in your chest like a secret you’ll carry into the waking world.
