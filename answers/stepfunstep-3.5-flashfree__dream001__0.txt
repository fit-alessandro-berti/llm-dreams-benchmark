You start to walk, but the streets keep rearranging themselves. A broad boulevard you just stepped onto twists into a narrow alley smelling of damp stone and unknown spices. The city sounds are a layered hum—distant bells, snippets of conversation in languages you don’t recognize, and underneath it all, a low, almost sub-audible vibration, as if the whole place is breathing.

You check your wrist for a watch—there it is, a simple silver pocket watch you don’t remember owning. You snap it open. The hands are moving frantically, spinning in wild circles. The hour hand points to “meeting,” and the minute hand points to “now,” but the face has no numbers. You close it with a snap that echoes too loudly.

A figure in a long, dark coat glides past you, not walking but *sliding* along the cobblestones. They don’t seem to touch the ground. You call out, “Excuse me! The meeting! Do you know where—?”

They don’t turn, but their voice drifts back, layered like the city’s soundscape: “The meeting is with the Cartographer. Find the street that remembers your name.”

Before you can ask what that means, they dissolve into the fog that’s begun to roll between the buildings. The fog isn’t cold; it’s warm and sweet, like honey and old paper.

You decide the only way is up. You find a staircase that spirals up the side of a sheer building, its iron railing humming under your hand. With each flight, the city below changes. One level you see canals with gondolas piloted by silent figures in hoods. The next, tiered gardens hanging in mid-air. The air grows thinner. Your lungs ache, but the urgency—the pressing, gut-wrenching need to be *there*—pushes you higher.

At the top, the staircase opens not onto a roof, but into a vast, domed chamber that is simultaneously a library, a train station, and a celestial map. Books float in the air, pages fluttering. Train tracks curve into the starry vault of the ceiling. And in the center, on a simple wooden chair, sits a person.

They look up. Their face is familiar, but you can’t place it—a blend of a childhood teacher, a long-lost friend, a mirror you’ve avoided.

“You’re late,” they say, not unkindly.

“I couldn’t find it,” you blurt, breathless. “The city keeps changing. I didn’t know where to go.”

The Cartographer—you know that’s who this is—smiles faintly and gestures to the empty chair beside them. “You weren’t *lost*. You were *arriving*. The meeting wasn’t at a location. It was a state of navigation. The city is your mind’s map of all the paths you haven’t taken. The meeting…” They lean forward. “…was with the version of you who chose differently.”

You sit. The chair is solid. The frantic pocket watch in your hand has gone still. The hands now point to “here” and “now.”

Just as you open your mouth to ask what that means, the dream-thrum of the city shifts. The floating books slam shut. The train tracks dissolve into mist. The Cartographer’s face softens, blurs, and becomes your own reflection in the still surface of a pond you don’t remember kneeling beside.

You wake with a jolt. Your own room. Your real clock says 7:03 AM. You have an hour. You’re not late. But on your nightstand, next to your glasses, sits a small, silver pocket watch. Its hands are moving normally. You could swear it wasn’t there when you went to sleep.

And for a moment, you can still hear the city, faint as a heartbeat, beneath the sound of your own breathing.
