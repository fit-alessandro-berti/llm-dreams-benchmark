You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel your chest tighten as the clock on the wall begins to tick louder, each second echoing like a hammer. You open your laptop, but the screen blurs into a kaleidoscope of unfinished tasks and overlapping deadlines. Your colleagues’ voices warp into static, and when you glance up, their faces are featureless, smooth as porcelain.  

The keyboard melts under your fingers, pooling into a silvery liquid that climbs your arms, cold and heavy. You try to stand, but the floor quivers like gelatin. Your boss’s eyes glow neon red, and they hand you a stack of papers—each blank, yet somehow *screaming* with urgency. Panic rises, but then you notice a faint hum. The air shimmers, and time slows. A corridor of doors materializes behind you, each labeled with a different solution: *Delegate. Ask for help. Say no. Rewrite the rules.*  

You reach for the closest door, but your hand phases through it like smoke. The hum grows louder, merging with your heartbeat. When you turn back, the project is already done—a hologram of a finished report hovers in the air, glowing faintly. Your boss nods, dissolves into confetti, and the office floor cracks open, revealing an ocean beneath. You dive in, weightless, and the water tastes like relief.  

When you wake, the deadline is still there—but so is the memory of the ocean.
