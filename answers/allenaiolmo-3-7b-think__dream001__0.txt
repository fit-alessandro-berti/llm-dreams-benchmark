You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city where the streets ripple like liquid mercury underfoot, and buildings shift their facades with the wind. A clock tower looms ahead, its hands spinning wildly, yet its chimes sound impossibly distant. Your phone buzzes—*no signal*. Panic rises as you scan the horizon, but a single flicker catches your eye: a glowing, fractured symbol etched into a brick wall, resembling a half-melted hourglass.  

You follow it, your path narrowing into a labyrinth of mirrored alleys. The reflections multiply, showing countless versions of yourself: confident, hesitant, lost. A voice whispers, *"Turn left where the shadows align."* You do so, and the walls part to reveal a staircase spiraling upward, its steps made of light. As you climb, the city below distorts—roads twist into serpents, and bridges collapse behind you.  

At the top, you stand in a cavernous chamber. Dozens of hourglasses float mid-air, each filled with sand flowing in reverse. A figure in a clockwork cloak materializes, holding a key shaped like a crescent moon. *"The meeting begins when you trust the hands,"* they say, their voice echoing like wind through gears. You grip the key and insert it into an hourglass. Time freezes.  

The chamber dissolves into a grand hall where your colleagues sit at a long table. But the faces blur at the edges, their expressions familiar yet unrecognizable. When you speak, the room *shimmers*, and the figures solidify into the people you’ve avoided confronting—your doubts made visible. You address each, and as you do, the shadows shrink, their voices softening into reassurance.  

Suddenly, the hall crumbles into sand. You’re back in the city, the symbol now glowing brightly on the brick. The crescent key glints in your palm, warm and unbroken. You sprint toward the clock tower, its hands now steady at 3:00. You enter the meeting room just as the clock chimes. The faces there are real, their smiles genuine. You speak, and the room holds its breath—then erupts in applause.  

When you wake, the crescent key rests in your hand, cold and silent. Its faint glow lingers, a reminder that even in uncertainty, clarity can be found by listening to your own voice.
