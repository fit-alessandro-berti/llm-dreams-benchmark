**Dream Continuation:**

You wake up in a world bathed in golden sunlight, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and wild herbs. The sky is a vast, unbroken blue, dotted with birds you don’t recognize—some with iridescent feathers, others with cries like distant bells. Your clothes are strange: a rough-spun tunic, too large, with a belt woven from leather strips. No pockets. No phone. No wallet. Just you, standing in the middle of a dirt road that splits into two paths—one leading uphill toward a cluster of stone cottages with thatched roofs, the other winding down into a valley where smoke curls from chimneys and the distant clatter of a blacksmith’s hammer rings out.

Your first thought is panic. *How did I get here?* Then curiosity. You flex your fingers—no callouses, but no blisters either. You’re not used to labor, but your body doesn’t ache. Maybe you’re not from this time. Maybe you’re *supposed* to be here.

A child’s voice calls from the hillside. *"Hey! You lost?"* A girl of about ten, her dark braids tied with red ribbon, waves at you from the doorway of a cottage. She’s holding a wooden bowl and a loaf of bread. *"Mama says if you’re hungry, you can come eat. But you’d better not be a thief."* She grins, showing a gap where a tooth is missing.

You hesitate. The bread smells like honey and rye. Your stomach growls. But what if they don’t believe you? What if they think you’re a spy, or worse—a *witch*? (You’ve seen the stories in old books: people burned for things they didn’t understand.)

Then you remember the pouch at your waist—the one you *swear* wasn’t there before. You untie it. Inside: a small, smooth stone, warm to the touch, humming faintly. When you press it, symbols glow faintly on its surface—symbols you’ve seen in dreams, in the margins of forgotten texts. A map? A key? Or a warning?

The girl’s eyes widen. *"Where’d you get that?"*

You don’t answer. Instead, you ask her, *"What year is this?"*

She blinks. *"Year of the Black Plague’s end, they say. 1350, maybe?"*

Your breath catches. *1350.* No internet. No medicine. No way to prove who you are. But the stone pulses in your palm, as if it knows something you don’t.

The girl tugs your sleeve. *"Come on, then. Before the dogs wake up."*

And just like that, you’re walking toward the village, the stone heavy in your grip, wondering if you’re running *to* something—or *from* it.

**What happens next?**
- Do you trust the girl and the village, or slip away to explore alone?
- Does the stone reveal more secrets—or is it a curse?
- Is this a test? A punishment? Or just a very strange dream?
