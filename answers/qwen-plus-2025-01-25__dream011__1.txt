written in a language you've never seen before. The symbols twist and curl in intricate patterns, forming what looks like an ancient script. Panic begins to rise in your chest as you realize that not only do you not understand the questions, but the very paper itself seems to shimmer faintly, as if it's alive.

Suddenly, one of the symbols on the page starts glowing softly. It pulses with a rhythmic light, almost like a heartbeat. You lean closer, squinting at it, when suddenly the symbol shifts—it rearranges itself into something familiar: a single word written in your native language. The word is *listen*.

Confused but intrigued, you focus harder on the page. Another symbol glows next, this time transforming into the phrase *trust the process*. A strange calm washes over you despite the surreal situation. You take a deep breath and let go of your initial panic.

As you continue staring at the exam, more symbols begin shifting and reorganizing themselves, revealing short phrases scattered across the page:

- *"What matters most?"*
- *"Who are you becoming?"*
- *"What would love do?"*

You notice that these aren't traditional test questions—they feel more like riddles or reflections meant to provoke thought rather than demand answers. Intrigued, you pick up your pen and start writing down your thoughts, responding intuitively to each prompt.

Hours pass (or maybe just minutes; time feels distorted), and by the end of the exam, you’ve filled the pages with personal insights, memories, fears, and hopes. When you turn the last page, you see a final question glowing brightly at the top:  

*"Why did you choose this path?"*

For a moment, you're silent. Then, without hesitation, you write your answer. As soon as you finish, the room around you dissolves into darkness, leaving only the soft glow of the words you've written floating in front of you. 

And then... you wake up.
