…and the air thickens with the metallic scent of rain. The treetops begin to bow and whisper, their leaves shivering as the sky darkens to a deep, impossible violet. You look up and see clouds curling into spirals like ink in water, and for a moment you’re certain they’re spelling your name.

The first drops fall, heavy and warm, and each one bursts into tiny flashes of light when it hits the ground. The forest glows in pulsing rhythm. A low rumble rolls through the earth, but instead of fear you feel a pull, as if the storm is calling you forward.

You step through the undergrowth and into a clearing where a still pond mirrors the sky. The storm gathers above, then suddenly collapses into the water, turning it into a swirling doorway. Without thinking, you wade in. The surface doesn’t feel wet—it feels like silk.

On the other side, the rain is gone. You stand beneath a clear sky filled with stars, though it is still daytime. A figure made of mist smiles and hands you a small, glowing seed. “Plant this,” they whisper, and as you open your hand to do so, the dream begins to dissolve into morning light.
