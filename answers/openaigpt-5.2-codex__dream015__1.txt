…Despite the hardships, you decide to follow a faint column of smoke on the horizon instead of hiding. The air tastes of rust and rain, and every step sinks into ash, yet you move forward as if drawn by something older than fear. 

When you reach the source, it isn’t a fire at all—it’s a lone windmill turning slowly above a patch of green. A handful of strangers watch you from behind makeshift barricades. Their faces are smudged, their eyes wary, but one of them smiles and opens a gate fashioned from scavenged doors.

In that moment the dream shifts. The cracked streets dissolve into a river, the windmill becomes a lighthouse, and you are suddenly on a boat drifting through a night sky filled with stars. The strangers are beside you, rowing with oars made of bone and light, and you feel a calm certainty that this journey isn’t about surviving the ruins but about rebuilding the world in small, impossible ways. 

You wake just before the lighthouse beam reaches you, with the echo of their voices still humming in your ears.
