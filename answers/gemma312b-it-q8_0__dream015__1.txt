...to build an apothecary in the shell of what’s leftover of an old library. The roof had come in on half of it, but the south-facing wall had miraculously withstood a lot of the initial storms – just large enough, actually, to harness the sunlight needed for medicinal herbs to thrive. 

The initial cleanup was horrendous. Years, decades perhaps, of settled ash and twisted metal had formed a claustrophobes nightmare. But as I unearthed fragments of bookshelves, cracked panes of glass that glittered surprisingly beautiful under the weak light, and even some mildew-streaked sheets of paper (illegible at the moment, a tempting prospect for later understanding), a quiet purpose filled me. 

I spent days meticulously sorting through rubble. My hands were constantly raw; blisters popped frequently. There *used* to be a city park adjacent to the library, I surmised from faded murals on the crumbling foundation wall, and scattered evidence told of carefully maintained gardens. I started hunting those locations, scavenging for seed pods and surprisingly resilient roots. Thorns and rusty metal bits seemed to latch onto everything, ripping at both clothes and skin. 

My knowledge of botany hadn’t been particularly thorough *prior to the…event,* but my grandmother, stubbornly traditional, had insisted I learn to identify “safe” greens and roots even as a kid in the old world. It came rushing back, a dim but reliable intuition leading me from withered weeds to promising seedlings.

Soon, tiny rows of pots sat nestled in salvaged window troughs and broken vases. Bright red strawberries clung to makeshift supports fashioned from twisted fencing. Dried elder blossoms perfumed the air, competing slightly with the pervasive dust. People... other survivors… started poking their heads in, gaunt and wary. Initially, they’d only approach to watch, eyes skeptical and hopeless beyond comprehension.

 But as more blossoms unfurled and the strawberry’s tiny fruits plumped, their hesitation waned. Simple remedies: willowbark for fevers, chamomile tea for sleep. A salve made of crushed rosehips soothed burns and irritated skin where radiated burns had lingered too long beneath ragged clothes. Trade became hesitant at first; a coil of metal salvaged from a vehicle, a handful of purified water. Later, stories. Simple narratives passed quietly on the winds. Names regained meaning. A semblance of hope, fragile but definite, bloomed alongside rosemary and thyme, nurtured by sunlight flooding the remnants of old books - now repurposed as trellises and seed trays. 

My work wasn't about rebuilding civilization or battling whoever or whatever brought it all down. It was something quieter, slower – a steady, determined growing. I wasn’t rebuilding what *was,* but building what *could be*. And in the silence of that ruined library, surrounded by whispering life, I knew some part - the important part - had survived and started again.


...and then I heard the gentle chime of a rain stick…and slowly woke to the feel of the sunlight across my face. A warm smile spread across my lips. I felt a peculiar ache for the smell of old paper and the vibrant green life stubbornly clinging to survival. That… that *felt* strangely real.
