scramble to gather your notes, but everything on your desk has turned into shifting sand. The keyboard melts under your fingers, and the computer screen flickers, displaying lines of code that morph into ancient runes. Your boss stares at you expectantly, but now their face is blurred, as if obscured by fog.

You try to speak, to explain the situation, but your words come out in a strange, echoing whisper. Suddenly, the office walls expand infinitely, stretching into a vast, endless library filled with floating books and glowing charts. The pressure of the deadline still weighs on you, but now time itself feels uncertain—clocks on the walls spin wildly, sometimes forward, sometimes backward.

A colleague approaches, but their face is familiar and yet unknown, shifting between different people you've met before. They hand you a single sheet of paper, and as you read it, the words rearrange themselves into a single phrase: 

*"Wake up."*

But you’re not sure if you want to.
