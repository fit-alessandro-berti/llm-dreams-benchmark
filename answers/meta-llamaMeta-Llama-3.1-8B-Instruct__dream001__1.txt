...walk down a long, winding street in the center of the city, weaving past unfamiliar skyscrapers and street vendors selling everything from exotic spices to handmade jewelry. People rush past me in every direction, but no one seems to be paying attention to me, which is both a relief and a source of panic. I quicken my pace, trying to remember the details of the meeting I'm supposed to attend. Was it at a conference center? A high-end office building? A museum?

As I turn a corner, I spot a tall, imposing building with a grand entrance and a sign that reads "The Aurora Tower". A shiver runs down my spine as I hope that this might be the place. I push open the doors and step inside, where I'm greeted by a sleek, modern lobby with a stunning chandelier hanging from the ceiling. A security guard eyes me warily from behind a desk, and I approach him, hoping to get some answers.

"Excuse me," I say, trying to sound confident. "I'm supposed to have a meeting here in an hour. Can you tell me which floor it's on?"

The guard looks me up and down, clearly unimpressed, but nods after a moment and points to an elevator bank. "You need to go to the 23rd floor," he says. "But the security check is on the way there. Don't forget your ID."

My heart is racing now, but I take a deep "breath" and try to remember if I have my ID with me. Which, I realize, is a whole other problem...
