…each one peels back a layer of who you really are, forcing you to decide how badly you want the job—and what parts of yourself you’re willing to trade away.

The first challenge appears as a gleaming red door in the middle of nowhere. Behind it: your childhood bedroom, preserved like a museum. The instructions are simple: “Touch anything, and the version of you that lives inside this room vanishes.” You hesitate. The closer you get, the more you see—books you never finished, drawings you never showed anyone, the vinyl record you swore you’d play the day you “made it.” You press a finger to the doorknob, then pull back. You choose not to open it. The moment you walk away, the door melts into water, and from its surface rises the version of you that stayed small to keep everyone else comfortable. It follows at a distance, whispering your safe choices back to you every step of the way.

Challenge two is a maze made of mirrors. Every reflection shows you in a different costume: astronaut, coder, dancer, therapist, parent. Each reflection turns to you, identical yet unmistakably other, and asks, “Which of us gets to wear the job title at the end?” You try to reason with them, to explain that the real answer is “all of us.” But the mazes only multiply—korcobans of yourself arguing over whose memory of the dream job is the “true” one. Exhausted, you stop playing fair. Instead of choosing, you start building bridges between reflections. When you do, the mirrors ripple outward, revealing a single corridor lined with every version of you holding hands. The maze dissolves into a single, bright room where the question is no longer “which one?” but “what can we build together?”

By the fifth challenge the air tastes like copper and possibility. You’re flown to a city made entirely of clocks. Timepieces of every size tick in impossible rhythms; some run backward, others hang upside-down, dripping seconds instead of rain. At the center stands a figure in a suit sewn from calendar pages. “You’ve made it to the final round,” it says. “One last negotiation. The job is yours—if you can give up the very memory that led you here.” You stare at it, suddenly realizing the dream has never been about the job. It’s about the first time you felt certain you belonged somewhere, and you’ve been trying to recapture that feeling ever since. The question isn’t “What will you sacrifice?” but “Can you let that memory be enough without holding onto it forever?” You nod. The moment you surrender the memory, it unfolds into a flock of luminous origami birds that settle on your shoulders, warm and alive. The clocks stop. The city exhales.

The next morning you wake remembering only the taste of copper and music you can’t quite name. In the office parking lot sits a sleek black car with no license plate. Inside, the steering wheel turns itself, guiding you somewhere you’re not sure you’ve ever been—but you follow it anyway. The car pulls up to a building you’ve never seen, yet somehow recognize: a single-story studio with rain-streaked windows and a sign above the door that reads:

“Campus – where yesterday’s you meets tomorrow’s you, and they decide to collaborate.”
