…the challenges felt increasingly symbolic, each one reflecting the very reason I’d wished for this dream job – to translate ancient languages into modern human understanding that fostered compassion and challenged prejudice. 

The initial challenge was a visual one presented on a massive, obsidian scroll projected onto a perpetually swirling storm of crimson sand. I had to decipher a series of cave paintings depicting a long-forgotten conflict, stripping away the rage and violence and revealing the shared grief beneath. I used charcoal and slow, deliberate strokes upon a blank slate, letting the meaning bleed through gradually. To my surprise and bewilder frustration, the judges - a collection of shifting, ethereal faces, neither overtly disapproving nor congratulatory – simply observed, their eyes swirling like the storm.

The second challenge required me to hear a language only music could express – a melody composed by what I *k felt* was a wounded earth itself -  a lament echoing through a cavern of amethyst crystals. My task here was to capture its essence in a single paragraph of text. It tested my capacity for emotional vulnerability, forcing me to reach into forgotten memories of loss and resonate with the sadness within the music’s tones.  When I finished, the judging faces remained unchanged, adding subtle, golden dust to each of them like the fading light of a dying star. 

Finally, came the true test. I was plunged into a labyrinth woven from shadows and whispered regrets—each echoing with fragments of misused translations from centuries ago. At the labyrinth’s heart lay a single, flickering holographic projection: a distorted portrait of myself, embodying the careless scholar who'd prioritized intellectual conquest over empathy. My job wasn't to translate, but to *reconstitue*— to rewrite a pivotal paragraph from this scholar's work, infused with my new, revised understanding.  

As I touched the holographic image with a hesitant hand, the labyrinth solidified, the shadows revealing themselves as faces - all those who had been harmed by misunderstanding, by careless interpretations. 

Then… the voices began. They weren't words, not precisely. They were hues. Brilliant blues tinged with sorrow, fiery oranges pulsating with anger, muddy browns choked by despair... I realized, instinctively, that these were not complaints, but *warnings*. A desperate plea for the original intent to be salvaged. 




With trembling fingers,I began to re-scribe  – the words felt clumsy at first – but as I continued, guided by the hues shimmering around the projection,they morphed into phrases of acceptance, of cautious understanding, and most importantly – a plea for forgiveness. 



The world solidified with a quiet, almost painful luminescence. When I removed my hand, the hologram blinked out, and with it, something within me - a burden of responsibility, softened into a deep, compassionate resolve. 
 
I knew then, without being told, that I had succeeded. 



The shifting faces of the judges converged, radiating a slow, warm light. A single voice, synthesized and timeless, spoke: “You have not just translated, but understood. Welcome to the position of Linguistic Bridge.”  




Then, I snapped awake.  




The sunlight streamed through my blinds, and the persistent hum of the television drifted in from the next room.   But even as the dream faded, I could still  *feel*the colours – the hues – behind my eyelids. 



And I felt an incredibly strong urge - to start a journal today.
