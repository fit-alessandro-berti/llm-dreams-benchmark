…decide to walk away before you say something you can’t take back.

You turn down a side street that shouldn’t exist—narrow, brick-paved, lit by a line of streetlamps that flicker like they’re breathing. The air smells faintly of rain and oranges. Behind you, your friend calls your name once, sharp as a snapped thread, and then the sound is swallowed by the street itself.

Your phone buzzes. No notifications—just a blank screen reflecting your face, except your expression is wrong, like it belongs to someone who’s practiced being calm. You tap the glass anyway, and a map opens without any app around it. A single blue dot marks you, and a thin red line leads to a place labeled only: **“Where you meant it.”**

You follow.

The street spills you into a courtyard you recognize and don’t: the old playground from your childhood, but rebuilt with adult proportions. The swings hang too low, the slide is too tall, the seesaw is made of polished wood like an instrument. Everything is saturated, as if the world is overexposed and trying to remember itself.

Your friend is there, already sitting on the edge of the sandbox, hands folded, eyes fixed on the ground.

“You left,” they say, but it isn’t accusation so much as surprise.

You open your mouth to answer, and what comes out is the sentence you were afraid of saying earlier—only softened, the sharp edges filed down by something that sounds like honesty.

“I left because I didn’t trust myself,” you say. “I didn’t want to win. I wanted you to understand.”

Your friend looks up. Their face shifts slightly, like a picture settling into focus.

“Then say the part you keep circling,” they reply. “The real part.”

The courtyard goes quiet. Even the lamps stop flickering, holding their breath.

You try to speak, but instead you see it: the argument, like a scene behind glass. Both of you, talking over each other. The important thing that started it—small in shape, huge in weight. The way you both kept naming the same fear with different words.

Your friend stands and steps toward the seesaw. When they sit on one end, the other rises, waiting.

“Come on,” they say, softer. “If it matters, meet me in the middle.”

You sit. The plank tips, then steadies, and the movement feels like a decision being made.

For a moment neither of you talks. The world around you adjusts—colors dim, edges blur, like the dream is trying to make room for something true.

“I’m scared,” you admit, and it’s almost a relief to hear it out loud. “I’m scared that if I give on this, it means I never mattered. That I’m always the one who bends.”

Your friend’s shoulders drop a fraction, like they’ve been holding a weight too.

“And I’m scared,” they say, “that if I don’t hold the line, I’ll disappear. That if I let this go, no one will take me seriously again.”

The seesaw creaks, not from movement but from recognition.

You look at them—your close friend, the person you laugh with, the person who knows your habits and your history—and you suddenly notice something you missed: the exhaustion behind their anger. The same exhaustion you’ve been hiding behind yours.

The sandbox beside you shivers, the way a lake does when the wind changes. Something half-buried is there, a small metal box with a latch, covered in dust like old grief. Without speaking, you both reach down and pull it up between you.

A label on the lid reads: **“What we never said because it was easier to fight.”**

You hesitate, then open it.

Inside are pieces of paper folded into tiny squares—hundreds of them. You unfold one.

It’s in your handwriting: *I miss you even when we’re talking.*

Another, in theirs: *I don’t know how to ask for help without sounding weak.*

Another, yours: *I want you to choose me.*

Another, theirs: *I’m afraid you already did, and I’m not enough.*

The courtyard seems to lean in, listening.

Your throat tightens. “I didn’t know you were carrying that,” you say.

“I didn’t know you were either,” they answer.

You both laugh, but it isn’t funny. It’s the sound people make when they realize they’ve been stabbing at the same wound from opposite sides.

A bell rings somewhere above the streetlamps—clear and distant, like the start of school. The playground begins to empty itself, structures fading at the edges, as though the dream is losing patience.

Your friend reaches into the box and pulls out a final folded square. They hand it to you.

You unfold it.

It says, simply: *Tell them what you need. Not what you’re mad about.*

You look up. “I need to know you’re not leaving,” you say.

They blink hard, then nod. “I need to know you’ll stay even when I’m wrong,” they say. “Even when I’m…too much.”

The seesaw finally moves, gentle and even, rising and falling like breathing.

You both stand at the same time and the plank settles level, perfectly balanced, as if it has been waiting for you to do that all along.

The red line on your phone reappears, but now it splits into two paths, labeled: **“Forgive”** and **“Explain.”** Before you can choose, your friend takes the phone and turns it over.

“Neither,” they say. “We walk back together.”

You start toward the exit of the courtyard, and as you pass under the archway, your friend’s hand brushes yours—hesitant at first, then steadier, fingers hooking briefly like a promise you don’t have to say out loud.

The brick street is wider now, and the lamps don’t flicker. Somewhere far away, a version of your earlier argument fades like a TV being switched off.

At the corner, your friend stops.

“In the morning,” they say, “we’re still going to disagree.”

You nod. “But maybe we won’t be enemies about it.”

They smile—small, real. “Maybe.”

A soft, inevitable pull begins in your chest, the dream’s way of telling you it’s done with you. The street stretches, lengthens, turns into a hallway.

Behind you, your friend calls your name again—this time not sharp, but certain.

You turn, and they’re standing under a streetlamp that glows like a small sun, their outline blurring at the edges.

“Hey,” they say. “Text me when you wake up. Don’t let the day pretend this didn’t happen.”

You try to answer, but your mouth is full of light.

The hallway becomes your bedroom. The ceiling becomes the sky. Your eyes open.

On your phone, there’s a draft message you don’t remember typing:

*I’m sorry I walked away. I care more about us than being right. Can we talk—really talk—today?*
