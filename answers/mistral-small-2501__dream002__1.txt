As you feel the storm approaching, the once peaceful forest begins to transform. The gentle rustling of leaves gives way to the ominous howling of the wind. The sunlight filtering through the canopy is abruptly replaced by dark, menacing clouds that roll in, casting an eerie shadow over the forest floor.

The temperature drops rapidly, and you notice the hairs on your arms standing up. The first drops of rain begin to fall, heavy and cold, quickly turning into a torrent. The once serene forest is now a whirlwind of chaos, with trees swaying and branches snapping under the force of the wind.

As you hurriedly look for shelter, you stumble upon a small, ancient-looking cottage hidden among the trees. The door creaks open as if inviting you inside. The cottage is dimly lit, and the air inside is warm and comforting, a stark contrast to the storm raging outside.

Inside, you find an old woman sitting by the fireplace, her eyes twinkling with wisdom and warmth. She looks up and smiles, "Welcome, traveler. The storm has a purpose for you. Sit, rest, and I will tell you its meaning."

What happens next?
