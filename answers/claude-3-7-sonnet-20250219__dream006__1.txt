You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to feel a strange sensation in your feet. Looking down, you notice the stage floor has become transparent, revealing an endless ocean beneath. The audience doesn't seem concerned, their faces still turned toward you with anticipation.

As you approach the microphone, your notes transform into butterflies, fluttering away into the rafters. You reach for them instinctively, but they're gone. Oddly, you feel a sense of relief rather than panic.

When you open your mouth to speak, your voice emerges as music—a melody you've never heard but somehow know perfectly. The audience sways in unison, their expressions shifting from expectation to wonder. The ceiling of the auditorium gradually dissolves, revealing a night sky filled with stars that form constellations spelling out words you almost understand.

You continue your musical speech, finding that you can conduct the audience with subtle movements of your hands. Their collective voice joins yours, creating a harmony that makes the transparent floor beneath you glow with bioluminescence.

Just as you reach what feels like the crescendo of your performance, you notice someone familiar in the back row—perhaps a childhood friend or a future version of yourself—nodding with knowing approval at what you've accomplished.

The dream begins to fade at its edges, the way dreams do when they've delivered their message, leaving you with a lingering sense that you've communicated something important, even if you can't quite remember what it was.
