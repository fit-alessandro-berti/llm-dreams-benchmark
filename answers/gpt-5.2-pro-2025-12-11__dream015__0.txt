…Despite the hardships, you decide to stop scavenging for a day and build something that isn’t just *survival*.

You choose a place that used to be ordinary: the roof of a half-collapsed library, where the wind whistles through broken skylights and the city’s skeleton stretches out in every direction. The stairs up are choked with damp paper and plaster dust, and each step makes a soft, tired sigh—like the building is still trying to remember how to stand.

On the roof, the sky looks too big.

You spread your finds like offerings: a dented kettle, a spool of copper wire, three AA batteries that miraculously aren’t dead, a cracked solar garden light, and a small tin of seeds you’ve been carrying for weeks without believing you’d ever use them. There’s also a notebook, swollen from rain and age, the pages stuck together in places like the past refusing to open.

You sit with your back against a vent duct warmed by the afternoon sun and make a plan that’s simple enough to survive being a plan: a signal. Not a flare—those are loud and brief and invite the wrong kind of attention. Not a radio tower—too ambitious, too visible, too much like hope that can be stolen.

Something quieter.

Something that can keep breathing even if you don’t.

You strip the copper wire, wrap it around the metal frame of the vent, and rig the garden light’s tiny panel to trickle-charge the batteries. You don’t really know what you’re doing, but in dreams your hands remember skills you’ve never learned. The wire hums faintly when you touch it, as if the air itself has teeth.

When you finish, you wait.

The world below continues in its ruined rhythms: distant clattering, a bird that shouldn’t exist anymore calling from somewhere, the slow tumble of ash or pollen from the sky. Far away, a plume of smoke rises and disperses—someone else cooking, or burning, or signaling, or giving up.

As the sun slides down, your device begins to pulse: a soft blink, a pause, a soft blink. You decide it means “HERE.” Then you decide it means “ALIVE.” Then you realize it doesn’t matter what it means, as long as it means *something* besides silence.

You open the swollen notebook. Pages peel apart reluctantly, and you find that most of the writing has blurred into blue-gray bruises. But near the middle there’s a clean sheet—too clean, impossibly untouched by the years.

You write, carefully, as if letters are a kind of structure:

*If you see this light, you’re not the only one.*

The moment you finish the last period, the roof changes.

Not dramatically—dreams rarely bother with spectacle when they can do something subtler. The air gains weight, like a blanket pulled up to your chin. The city noises dim. Even your breathing sounds far away, as though it’s happening in a different room.

And then you notice: the library isn’t entirely empty.

Behind a cracked skylight, inside the shadowed upper floor, a lamp is lit.

It’s the kind of lamp that shouldn’t work. Warm, steady, domestic. A yellow circle of light on a table.

You didn’t turn it on.

You stare, trying to decide whether you’re afraid. Your body chooses curiosity before you can vote. You climb down through the broken skylight, hands sliding on dusty metal, and drop into a room that smells like old glue and rain.

The lamp sits on a wooden desk that looks too intact. On the desk is a small stack of books, neatly aligned, their titles unreadable as if the letters have been rubbed away. Next to them lies a cup of tea steaming gently, though you don’t smell anything. The steam curls in slow spirals, as if it has all the time in the world.

A chair is pulled out, angled toward you, expectant.

You don’t hear footsteps. You don’t hear breathing. But you feel—very clearly—that you’re being observed by something patient and awake.

On the wall behind the desk hangs a map of the city. Someone has marked it with thin red lines: routes, patterns, circles. In the center is a dot labeled in careful handwriting:

**LIBRARY**

Beneath it, another line, written as if in answer to your note, as if it’s been waiting there all along:

*I saw your light.*

The lamp flickers once, like a blink.

The shadowed corners of the room seem to lean in closer, listening.

You swallow. Your throat makes the loudest sound in the world.

“Who are you?” you ask, but your voice comes out the way voices do in dreams—too clear and too close, as if it’s being spoken directly into your own ear.

The answer doesn’t arrive as words.

It arrives as understanding.

This place—the library, the roof, the lamp—isn’t just shelter. It’s a hinge. A pocket of the world where things can be stored: not only books and maps and seeds, but messages. Intentions. Choices. The fragile parts of people that usually get crushed first.

You look down at your hands and realize they’re smudged with ink you didn’t touch. When you rub your fingers together, the ink smells faintly of pine trees and electricity.

The city outside groans in the wind, reminding you that monsters and hunger and cold are still real. The apocalypse hasn’t softened just because you found a lamp.

But inside the circle of lamplight, the air feels almost… held.

You sit in the chair.

The moment you do, the map on the wall shifts. Not physically—more like your attention slides, and suddenly you can *see* the red lines as routes you’ve walked before, even ones you’ve never taken. You recognize alleys you’ve never visited. You remember a bridge that collapsed in a year that hasn’t happened.

And then you understand the rule of the dream:

You can build.

Not just traps and shelters, not just gadgets that blink in the dark.

You can build *meaning*—and meaning is a kind of fuel.

Outside, your rooftop signal continues its steady pulse, a small mechanical heartbeat. Somewhere in the ruins, someone might see it. Somewhere in the ruins, someone might follow it. Or maybe the light isn’t for strangers at all.

Maybe it’s for you—later. Another version of you, thinner and colder and close to forgetting why you’re still moving.

You reach for one of the blank books on the desk. Its cover is plain, but it feels heavy with unspent stories.

On the first page, written in the same careful hand as the map, is a single instruction:

*Begin where the world ended. Continue from there.*

You pick up the pen beside it. The nib is already wet.

Above you, through the shattered roof, the last slice of sunset fades, and the first stars appear—sharp as nails, bright as promises.

You lean forward into the lamplight, and you decide to write a future into the margins of the ruined world, one page at a time, while the signal on the roof keeps saying, over and over:

Here.

Alive.

Not alone.
