...feel a cold dread creep up my spine. The fluorescent lights of the office buzz a deafening rhythm, each hum a hammer blow against my skull. My boss, Mr. Henderson, is standing over me, a tightly wound spring of a man with a face etched with perpetual impatience. He's pointing at a mountain of documents on my desk, a physical manifestation of the sheer weight of the task.

"Right, Smith," he barks, his voice sharp enough to cut glass. "Project Chimera. Deadline: Tomorrow morning. We need this ready for the presentation. No excuses."

Tomorrow morning? My heart hammers against my ribs. I glance at the papers. They blur before my eyes. There are flow charts, spreadsheets overflowing with numbers, complex schematics that look like they were drawn in a language I've never seen. The subject matter? I can't even grasp it. Something about… terraforming Mars using genetically modified algae? It’s a total enigma.

My mouth feels dry, my hands clammy. I try to speak, to plead, to point out the glaring impossibility of the deadline, but the words catch in my throat, strangled by a sudden, overwhelming panic. It’s like I’m underwater, desperately gasping for air.

I try to reach for the first document, to at least make a start, but my arms feel heavy, leaden. As I reach, my fingers brush the cold metal of my stapler. It feels… significant, like a key. I stare at it, the silver reflecting the buzzing lights. Then, the scene starts to warp. The office shrinks, the sounds distort, the documents begin to… morph.

They're no longer papers. They're living things, wriggling and pulsating, covered in what looks like phosphorescent slime. The office is no longer an office, but a pulsating, fleshy landscape. Mr. Henderson has become a giant, grotesque insect, his face a distorted caricature of his usual features, his eyes like cold, black marbles.

He clicks his mandibles, his voice a guttural rasp. “Well, Smith? Get to it! The presentation awaits! Time is… of the essence!”

My stapler gleams in the dim light, radiating a bizarre warmth. And I know, with a chilling certainty, that I have to stapler these living things. I have to make the presentation. And if I don't… something terrible will happen.
