…open your mouth to protest, but the words fall out like paperclips, pinging across the carpet and skittering under desks. Your boss doesn’t seem to notice. He nods, expectant, eyes ticking like metronomes. The fluorescent lights hum louder, folding into a chorus of “due, due, due,” and your monitor blossoms into a hundred windows, each one a mirror reflecting a slightly different you—older, younger, dressed in a wetsuit, wearing a birthday hat—typing furiously with hands that become fountain pens, ink pooling into graphs that turn into constellations.

You dive in anyway, because everyone else is already underwater. The office is filling from the floor up with cool, greenish water, memo pages sailing past like jellyfish. Your keyboard floats, and you chase it, slow-motion, while spreadsheets unfurl like kelp forests. When you catch it, the keys are soft as bread. Every time you press Return, a door opens somewhere in the cubicles, and a breeze of salt air sweeps out, smelling of citrus and toner.

“Remember the scope,” your boss intones from the top of a rolling ladder that now extends into a cloud. He’s balancing a teacup. He’s wearing your watch. “We need it yesterday.”

You nod, because that’s how time works here: yesterday is just behind the potted plant, and you can reach it if you bend your elbow backwards. You do, and your arm telescopes through the fern into a small, warm room where your childhood desk sits under a window. Crayons wait in a neat row. The project brief is written in crayon too: Draw the sky.

Simple. Impossible. Your hands—still pens—begin to quicken. You draw a sky that is more like the inside of a seashell. It hums. It fills with sticky notes that are actually stars with tasks written on them: Align planets by noon. Teach the stapler to sing. Apologize to the printer. You check each one off, and the stars dim, content.

When you resurface, your boss is clapping in slow, underwater thunder. “Good progress,” he says, and his tie reaches down and taps your shoulder like a third hand. “Now, iterate.”

The office tilts. Gravity forgets itself. Everyone glides along the ceiling tiles, sipping coffee that remains obediently in its cups. You crawl across a long conference table that grows longer as you move, like a treadmill of polished wood, filled with little knots that blink when you look directly at them. A slide deck blossoms across the air, each slide a different season. Autumn is a scatter of deadlines shaped like leaves. Winter is a clean blank page, merciless and perfect. Spring starts playing elevator music that becomes birdsong.

You keep going because the distant end of the table holds a bell, and you know, if you ring it, the deadline will pause to listen. You reach for it. Your hand passes through it as if it’s made of fog. You laugh, or maybe your laugh is a flock of pigeons that bursts toward the windows, which open like eyes.

“Don’t worry,” whispers the photocopier. It has been watching you this whole time, its glass serene as a pond. “Just make a copy of yourself.”

And in the way dreams understand bureaucracy, you do. You press your palm to the glass, and the light bar slides beneath your skin, filling each fingerprint with a warm silver glow. The machine whirs, coughs, and produces page after page of you—some wearing different shoes, some with languages you forgot you knew, some with the perfect comeback. They line up politely, shake your hand, and fan out across the office, each taking a slice of the impossible. The room is suddenly busy with you, all of you humming in key, the chorus changing “due, due, due” into “do, do, done.”

The water drains through the carpet as if the building just remembered the word floor. The fluorescent lights settle into a daylight so gentle you want to pocket it. Your boss checks his watch—you watch—smiles, and the smile is a paper plane. He throws it, and it sails between all your versions, gathering their pages into its folds until it’s enormous, a great soft origami whale.

You don’t ask how, you simply climb aboard with all of your selves. The whale dips its fin into the inbox, scoops up the last unfinished thing, and carries it to the window. Outside, the city is a filing cabinet tipped on its side, drawers glowing. The whale slips out into the blue inter-office mail of the sky, leaving behind a confetti of paperclips that rain into your open hands. They are warm. They are tiny moons.

On the tail of the whale, someone has penciled a note in your handwriting: Extend the deadline.

And the horizon obliges, unrolling like a ribbon until it touches your desk. You place the completed project there. It’s lighter than a thought, heavier than a sigh. Your boss plucks it up, nods gravely, and then he is just a coat on a chair, and the chair is a rocking horse, and the rocking horse is a metronome, clicking slower, slower, until the only sound is your own breath arranging itself into a neat, final paragraph.

“Good work,” the office plants whisper, rustling like applause. “Go home.” But you’re already there, because the office door opens not to a hallway but to your kitchen, where the kettle is whistling in the exact same pitch as the fluorescent lights used to hum. You pour tea into a mug that says, in letters that weren’t there before you blink, Impossible is a meeting you can decline.

When you take a sip, the calendar curls at the edges and floats up, a soft white cloud, and you remember that on the other side of this wall is the ocean, and on the other side of the ocean is a desk, and on the other side of the desk is you, waking with the taste of tea on your tongue and a paperclip in your fist, certain, for a moment, that if someone handed you the sky again, you would draw it.
