...a blank canvas floating in midair, untouched yet humming with potential. The air around it shimmers like heat haze, and though the world pulses with swirling nebulas of color and geometry that fold in on themselves, the canvas remains perfectly still, a pocket of quiet intensity.

You reach out, not with your hand but with a *thought*, and instantly, a single stroke of cobalt blue appears—thin, deliberate, cutting across the white like a comet trail. The moment it forms, the landscape *reacts*. The sky, which had been molten gold and emerald spirals, suddenly deepens into twilight, and constellations ignite in sync with the brushstroke’s rhythm.

Another thought, and crimson swirls bloom from the corner of the canvas—an abstract flame. The ground beneath you softens into velvet dunes that undulate like breathing. You laugh, and the sound manifests as golden glyphs that spiral upward, dissolving into birds made of stained glass.

But then the canvas begins to move on its own.

A new shape emerges—dark, angular, foreign. It’s not your thought. It slices through your painted sky like a shadow blade. The landscape stutters. Colors flicker and invert. You try to paint over it, to dissolve it with sunbursts and ribbons of light, but the shape resists. It *grows*, branching like ink in water.

From within the dark form, a voice—neither loud nor kind—whispers:

**"You did not come here to paint. You came to remember."**

And suddenly, the canvas isn’t blank anymore.

It’s filled with a single image: a doorway. An ordinary wooden door, slightly ajar, leading into darkness. But you *know* this door. It’s from a house that no longer exists. From a time you buried.

The surreal world begins to fold inward, colors draining like water down a sink. The painted sky, the glass birds, the velvet dunes—all collapsing into the canvas, sucked into that open doorway.

And then, it’s just you and the door.

A choice hangs in the silent air.

Step through?

Or wake up?
