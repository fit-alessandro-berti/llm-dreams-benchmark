You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and…  

…a cluster of strangers laughing in a corner, their voices overlapping in a cacophony of jokes you can’t quite decipher. You edge closer, hoping to catch a fragment of familiarity, but their laughter morphs into a chorus of unfamiliar languages, and the room seems to tilt. A server passes by with a tray of glowing, translucent drinks that hum faintly. You reach for one, but your hand goes through it like smoke.  

Nearby, a group huddles around a table covered in intricate, shifting puzzles—wooden pieces that rearrange themselves into constellations, then into faces you recognize but can’t name. One of them glances up, their eyes briefly reflecting your own face, distorted and ageless. You freeze. *Is that…?* But when you blink, they’re gone, replaced by a woman in a sequined dress who offers you a slice of cake that tastes like static and nostalgia.  

You press on, weaving through a crowd that seems to multiply with every step. A man in a tuxedo plays a violin, but the notes he draws are shapes in the air—swirling vines, flickering flames, a keyhole that vanishes when you look directly at it. Behind him, a group debates fiercely about the meaning of time, their arguments echoing like thunder. One of them gestures wildly, and suddenly the clock on the wall begins to unravel, its hands dissolving into sand that falls like rain.  

Then, a voice—soft, familiar—calls your name. You turn, and there they are, standing beside a door that shouldn’t exist: a tall, arched portal framed with ivy, glowing faintly blue. But as you approach, the person’s face blurs, shifting between your friend and someone else entirely—a stranger with your own eyes. They smile, but their lips don’t move.  

“You’re late,” they say, their voice layered with echoes. “The party’s about to change.”  

Before you can respond, the room shudders. The guests dissolve into paper birds that take flight, the walls melt into water, and the door swings open to reveal not a hallway, but a starry void. Your friend steps through, beckoning. You hesitate—*this isn’t real, this isn’t real*—but the dream pulls you forward, the weight of the gathering fading behind you as the stars whisper secrets only you can hear.  

And then, you wake up, clutching a half-remembered name, the taste of static on your tongue.
