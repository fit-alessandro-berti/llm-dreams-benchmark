The sun glints off the endless glass and steel canyons, a blinding, directionless light. A cold knot of panic tightens in your stomach. *An important meeting. One hour.* The address, a string of numbers and a street name you’ve never heard, is printed on a crumpled slip of paper in your hand, but it’s a map to a place that doesn't exist on any map you can find.

You fumble for your phone. The screen is dark. No matter how long you hold the power button, it refuses to wake up. A passing businessman in a sharp suit bumps into you, not even breaking his stride, and mutters something about "tourists."

Desperation sets in. You approach a hot dog vendor, his cart smelling of onions and steam. "Excuse me," you say, your voice tight. "Do you know where this is?" You thrust the paper at him.

He squints at it, then at you, his face a mask of confusion. "This street... it doesn't run that way. Not in this part of the city. Maybe in Old Town? But that's a thirty-minute train ride, at least."

Old Town. The words ring a bell, a faint, distant chime from the depths of your memory. You thank him and start to run, the weight of your briefcase pounding against your leg with every step. The crowds part around you like a river around a stone, faces blurred and indifferent.

You find a subway entrance, a gaping mouth leading into the earth. The air grows cool and smells of damp concrete and electricity. You rush to a map, a tangled web of colored lines. Your eyes scan frantically for the Old Town stop. There it is: a tiny dot on the orange line. You calculate the time: twenty minutes on the train, if you're lucky.

You buy a token from a machine with coins fished from the very bottom of your pocket. The turnstile clicks, and you descend further, onto a platform where the air vibrates with the approach of a train. The electronic sign flickers: **DESTINATION: OLD TOWN.**

Relief washes over you. You step aboard as the doors hiss open. The car is strangely empty, lit by a sickly yellow light. The doors close, and the train lurches forward, picking up speed, faster than any subway should, the lights in the tunnel outside streaking into continuous, blinding lines.

You watch the stops on the illuminated map above the door. 42nd Street... 59th... 86th... The train isn't slowing. It rockets past your stop, the name "Old Town" flashing by the window in a blur.

"You missed your stop," a voice says.

You turn. An old woman is sitting in a corner seat you could have sworn was empty. She's knitting something complex and shadowy.

"The train doesn't stop there for you," she continues, not looking up from her needles. "Not today. You have to get off at the next station and take the stairway that isn't there."

The train screeches to a halt at a nameless platform. The doors open. The woman vanishes. You’re the only one who gets off.

The platform is deserted. The air is thick and silent. You look around. There’s the regular exit, a staircase leading up to daylight. And then, as if your eyes suddenly learn to focus on a new wavelength, you see it: another archway, darker, leading to a narrow, spiraling stone staircase descending deeper into the earth.

You have a choice. The rational stairs to an unknown street above, or the impossible stairs down.

With only twenty minutes left, you choose the impossible.

You start down the stairs. They are old, worn smooth by countless feet. The sound of the city fades completely, replaced by the whisper of your own breathing and the distant, melodic drip of water. The staircase ends in a long, narrow corridor lined with countless doors, each one identical and unmarked.

One of them, you know, is your meeting room.

You walk down the corridor, your footsteps echoing. You pause, your hand hovering over a doorknob made of cold, tarnished brass. This is it. A sense of certainty fills you.

You take a deep breath, turn the knob, and step through.
