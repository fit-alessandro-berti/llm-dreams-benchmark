gratefully accept their guidance. They lead you down a winding alley that seems unfamiliar, yet oddly comforting. As you walk, the cityscape around you begins to change—the buildings stretch taller, their windows glowing with soft, golden light. The air hums with a melody you can't quite place, as if the city itself is singing.

One of the strangers, a woman with luminous eyes, turns to you and says, *"You’ve been here before, haven't you?"* 

Before you can answer, the alley opens into a vast garden suspended in the air, floating high above the city. Strange, otherworldly flowers bloom in impossible colors, their petals shimmering with every shade of an unspoken memory. 

The strangers begin to fade, their outlines flickering like candlelight in the wind. The woman smiles one last time and whispers, *"This is where you're meant to be."* 

You look down and realize that your feet are no longer touching the ground—you are weightless, drifting into the sky as the city falls away beneath you. A feeling of peace washes over you, as if everything finally makes sense.

Then, just as you begin to understand the meaning of it all… 

You wake up.
