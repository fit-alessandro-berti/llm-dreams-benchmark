...the air crackles with an unnatural energy.

A few moments ago, dappled sunlight had danced through leaves, painting the forest floor in a mosaic of gold and emerald. Now, the wind, whispering secrets just moments before, had begun to howl.  Leaves, whipped up by the approaching gale, swirled frantically around me, a chaotic tapestry against the foreboding grey sky. Fat raindrops, each one carrying the sharp smell of ozone and damp earth, splattered on the moss-covered ground, a prelude to the impending deluge.

Panic tightened its icy grip around my heart. The once gentle breeze turned into a violent wind, rustling the leaves in a frenzy, carrying the faint scent of pine and approaching urgency. 

I quicken my pace, feeling the tremor in the earth as thunder rumbles in the distance. The forest, once alive with bird song and the murmuring kibble of the brook, seems to hold its breath, a nervous hush falling upon the rustling leaves. The forest is no longer peaceful. As the first drops become a downpour, the tension in the air builds.  

There, through the towering trees, a jagged bolt of lightning illuminates the path, striking a tree just off the trail with an explosive **crackle**. I stop dead, breathless, as a gust of wind slams the branches against a nearby rock, sending **shivers** down my spine.

My mind races. The sudden shift in the air is unsettling; this isn't a typical thunderstorm. It feels... purposeful.

Harmful creatures scurry away from the damaged tree, driven from their hiding places by the heat of the lightning strike. Something ancient and magnificent wakes beneath it. 

What rises from the ground is no mere animal. Its form is humanoid, but for its stark, white fur and glowing red eyes. Maybe it's the fear, the way the air crackles with uncertainty, that makes it favour the freshly-forged path.

**Something immense, though,

Because they see me just now standing rooted in

Fear, a large, hulking shadow, watches the falling leaves turn into streaks of sunlight in my wake. I stop dead, not from shock this time,

But from a gut-wrenching realization of being utterly lost

In this whispering, swirling chaos of green and brown.

Standing before a pointed, skeletal claw reaching out

From a gigantic, shadowy talon.

Not falling. Retreating before it. My breath comes in weak, muffled rasps.**


The dream shifted further.

**The forest itself was fleeing, the trees bending and swaying, their branches knocking against pruned trees, cracks appearing in its bark as a warning.  I heard the mournful cries of birds and the crashing of thunder closer now. We've discovered a new element to the fear. The storm now followed me as I stumbled blindly through the moonlit woods. I don't know how

Long I wandered, but it felt long

Before me was no longer visible, lost

in

My dream transformed

The woman with black eyes emerges from the shadows, fear radiating from her crimson

eyes resonating with the rumble. Her voice, when she speaks, is a

Low growl that vibrates through the saturated bark and leaves.

I move forward cautiously, peering into the darkened woods where every tree is swaying, running from the cascading fear that spills across them.  The golden light mocks the depths of my wanderings, but even as I marvel at the spectacle**...

The ground trudged backward, my path widened to a path! and it

reveals a creature with **snowy wings, a creature of the night, emerging.

The campfire, normally a tiny speck of orange light against the dark trees, was gone. All was pitch black.  

**This is where I leave the dream to your imagination. What happens next? Does the shadow become dominant? Do they find the creatures?**

**Do you think we can brainstorm some ideas together about what this looming creature might be and why they are causing the forest to react in such a scary way? What kind of atmosphere does this fear create? Let me know what you think!**
