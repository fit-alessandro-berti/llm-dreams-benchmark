...the air grew heavy with a stillness that felt almost ominous before the first fat raindrops began to splatter on the mossy forest floor, sending ripples outwards from where they landed. The silence was replaced by the unsettling grumble of thunder in the distance, a low threat growing steadily louder with every step I took. A shiver ran down my spine as thunder crackled closer and the wind whispered warnings through the leaves. 

The woods around me, previously bathed in dappled sunlight, grew dark and menacing under the gathering storm clouds. The peaceful rustling of the leaves now sounded like angry whispers, and the occasional sunbeam slicing through the canopy only seemed to highlight the tension in the air, the dappled light losing its charm. 

The storm arrived with a vengeance, a sudden gust whipping through the trees and tearing leaves loose. The sky, moments ago a vibrant blue, was now bruised purple, swirling with heavy rain and mirroring the darker turn in my dream.  Giant trees, once friendly giants, groaned under the force of the wind, their branches clawing at the sky like skeletal hands. I ducked for cover beneath a thick bough of an oak, clothes already soaked from the sudden downpour. The air, thick with humidity and the smell of wet earth, crackled with electricity. It was time for the storm to break – directly instrumental in my hands, at this moment.

The first fork of lightning struck the ground near me, a searing bolt that illuminated the nearby trees with an eerie brightness. The trees around me weren't the ones I knew. No, these were ancient, gnarled things with branches that seemed to reach out for me, their touch strangely frigid despite the storm raging around us. The rain quickly turned into a deluge, pounding the undergrowth with a startling ferocity.

But soon, the storm's fury abruptly focused in the center of a clearing. A fearless squirrel, impossibly large, perched on a rock, stood still for a concerning moment as it contemplated the swirling vortex of wind and rain, then a thick column of lightning sprang from its bushy tail with each strike unleashing a torrent of icy power. 

I watched, mesmerized, as a beam of pure white light shot from the center of the storm, arcing through the storm, scattering the dark energy and revealing a girl. She couldn't have been more than 12, her blonde braids swinging wildly in the storm as she gracefully dodged each bolt of energy, her eyes filled with a chilling, inhuman light. The girl stood in the center of the electrical storm, a halo of sparks around her brown fur lit face.  

With each coldising crackle of the lightning, her eyes seemed to glow brighter, but her fur grew whiter. Each spike, every flash a fragment of her embodied warmth vanished, replaced by a pure white, spectral fur. I watched in horror as she started to read poems aloud from a rolled book but the words coming from her lips were something the author had never written before. The words she spoke held a raw, untapped power – a coldness that seemed to reach out and yank at my very soul, sending an icy chill through myself.



The girl, with a mischievous smile, started reciting, but her words weren't the usual sonnets and ballads of poets lost to the decline. They were raw, cold words, filled with the power of ice and all speaking of a world iced over, froze a sea of scared onlookers' eyes to the clearing.

"She was a girl of autumn gold,

They think they know me, they have been

Told of my heart, so brave and bold,

But I’m a blizzard of words, you see, a surprise scene."

 "What strange rhymes," I thought, "for a clearing made bright with meadows. And what’s a 'suggestion box'

doing in this fantastical, chilling light?" 

She stepped

aside and there it stood, her pale eyes aglow.

The girl whistled. Her hand, now full

of embers and smoke"
a glowing, neon orange holodragon, papers flying by, a chaotic swarm,

in which a young woman sat on a chair made of ice, seemingly

unaware of the wintery storm she was riding.

"Don't steal these the poets' tales from her chair," the girl with the ghostly voice cautioned. "This is a work of her heated heart, understand.”

She tossed bundles of

difficulties into my hands, poetry the heavy and potent in them. I stared at her, perplexed.

"What poets?" she shivered, a delicate, rippling

sound, the words spoken to dinosaurs,

But then they took her hand, touched its shimmering, translucent skin,

feeling the warmth of her touch fade to

patterns, to scales and stuffing. 

The girl kidded

with statistics and she’s planning a route, a brilliant flurry of

information subzero.” She knew about the ultra-sonic puffs,

each one charged with words,

forming words

that echoed through the pre-dawn chill, materializing.  Coughing, I felt the words claw at my throat: “Such slow, damaging, yet puerile taunts,” I'm whimpering, “are these mortals’ simple games?”

 They chuckled, a coldising sound, icy 

something I couldn't understand, but not

for you, they whipped their head around,

snarling as they

looked at me, eight massive swirling eyes

Meeting the terrified blue gaze of a giraffe whose

skin color faded away with each word.
