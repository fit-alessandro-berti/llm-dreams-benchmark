Sure, here's a tailored outline for you to flesh out your dream’s apocalypse:

---

**You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world...**

You know nothing about your past until you discover a scrap of a document you can't shake: a map. The cover shown reads "Project Erebus: A Means of Survival for Concerned Scientists."

1. **Who are *concerned scientists*?** Assist Wayne Chen, a brilliant but resourcefulementealt engineer, who abandoned his ambitions when the apocalypse struck. He’s now seasoned in working with scavenged tech. **StyleTip: troubled past, obsession with solving the tech question**

2. **His latest codeword:** “Interlink-7,” which promises a working portal to a quarantined laboratory on the far side of the globe, but the weapon to activate it is buried deep within a heavily fortified, solar-powered bunker on a remote island. "Can you trust this, woman?" he grinds, his spectacles echoing through the whisper.

3. **The map itself:** A micro-film circuit with a cryptic message from a rogue scientist named “Spark” who was studying mutated organisms for echoes of memories. "Seek **The Claimant's Sanctuary.” **StyleTip: reading fingers tapping down as you study the map**

**Despite the hardships, you decide to..** 

A) *Seek survival for yourself and help Wayne reclaim his work.**

*At first, mysteries are everywhere. The air sometimes sizzles to remind you of power that once terrified you. You start documenting, too excruciating cramped keyboard to make bearable.*

B) *Raid resources in the hopes of friends or power. But beware — you’ll be hunted by everything that flies and everything that crawls.*

C) *Seek out the Claimant’s Sanctuary** just to unravel the puzzle of Spark’s claim and discover something more than humanity’s last blips.*

D) *Establish your own posse of scavengers, hoping to find sustenance and safety in a reality that’s already swept through.* 
*As you loop, the sound of attacked wreckage draws your eyes underwater. You begin to think, If *I* can’t be saved… *)*

E) *Leave** to wander the wilderness, searching for what could be beyond every horizon—so thinly imagined were the dense forests before. With nowhere to pick up anything except the bio-stress thrones she once master-ed, I’m about to freeze this conductor to freezing the rhythm of life. *

**Choose your path**, and design your world with a personal touch!

Feel free to explore these directions and add any due-to the opportunity to choose your own narrative! **Can you think of how this could react to a few of these options?** 

**A: As you start your journey with Wayne to reclaim Interlink-7:**
You find yourself on a loyal, six-legged dog beast, a creature you can’t fully understand but can still utilize. The dog stops at a rusty crate marked “Technometal Haveur’s Survival Kit,” filled with rods, ingredients for some Strogat troopers’ last dawning Waits. As you dig deeper, you realize this kit includes audio recordings of roaming metallic zombies, signs of a growing ecosystem a driver for championing the former mathematician. “She saved more than I would,” you say, “we should support this.”
You turn back to Casey critical. “That’s a novelty plan, but our tech’s barely even getting us home!” 

**B: Walking into a scavenged shanty, the cast sighs as guerrilla americans, a man who claims to have had “five anguishing marriages” just to run but ever-recalling the name of his first love, a fellow solider who vanished in dust. He takes you to “The Empulse,” but claims “any ones who argue” take him down.” “Right”. The term kama, an animal of coarse fur and extra canines that attacks anything inadvertently touched after an encounter with a collapsing gear scorpion, stares down at you with glowing eyes. You look up at the men and women, streams of tears streaming down Shane’s face.

**C: Discovering the Claimant’s Sanctuary**

Outside the shack (which you now see as a silent veil inhabited by a restickard creature shaped like a rusted, canoe-sized pirate craft), a dilation telescope reveals unusual broadcasts- dispatched to distant adherents. They bemoan the loss of humanity’s memories and correct what they insist, “this edifice’s a concept, a metaphor for chaos”. You create a small beacon, seeking out the signal. Unseen vertices emerge from the structure’s windows; the creature (or the strange creature) points at a swirling artistic vortex. “To what humbles, even the highest soul must fall?”

**Choose a direction and create your world!** How could you see your world in this path? You are welcome to adapt these examples. Let me know to help you further.
