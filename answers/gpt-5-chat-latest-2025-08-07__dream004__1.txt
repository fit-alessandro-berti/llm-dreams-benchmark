you feel an urge to touch it.  

The moment your fingertips graze the empty surface, the canvas shivers like water disturbed by a pebble. Colors seep out from your hands — first a deep violet, then a slow bloom of golden light — and spread across the blank expanse in swirling, living patterns. The shapes dance away from you, drifting off the edges of the frame into the air, as though the boundary between painting and reality has dissolved.  

Suddenly, the world around you begins to echo the patterns you’ve made. Trees twist into spirals, the ground forms a mosaic of shimmering tiles, and the sky rearranges itself into a vast, breathing mural. You realize that with every thought, every emotion, the landscape shifts again, responding as if it is alive and listening.  

In the distance, across a glittering river that flows upward into the sky, you see another canvas standing alone, radiating a soft pulsing light. You know instinctively that whatever you paint there will change this dream forever — but a voice, whispering from nowhere and everywhere, says:  

*"Only the truth can hold its shape here."*  

Would you like me to continue the dream and reveal what happens when you approach the second canvas?
