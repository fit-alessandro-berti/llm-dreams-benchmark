…and a single, humming paint-brush floating inches above it, vibrating like a tuning fork struck by silence itself. You reach out instinctively; the brush settles into your palm as though it had been waiting for your touch since the first dawn of color.

The bristles are white, but when you tilt them toward the sky the changing clouds are sucked into them—swirls of lavender, shards of gold, ripples of emerald. Every hue you have ever seen, every tint you have only imagined, gathers at the tip, eager to become something new.

You lift the brush to the canvas. It doesn’t meet resistance; instead, the surface opens like water. The first stroke releases a ringing note—turquoise with a flavor of sea-salt memory—and suddenly you are painting not with pigment, but with entire sensations. One stroke becomes the laughter of your childhood friends skipping stones. Another becomes the scent of rain on warm asphalt. A third blooms into a long-lost lullaby, sung by a voice you can’t quite place but absolutely trust.

The canvas widens, stretching beyond its wooden frame until it is the horizon itself. Your hand keeps moving, faster now, each gesture seeding whole constellations. When you flick your wrist, a flock of origami cranes bursts forth, their wings folding and unfolding in slow tides of magenta light. When you press the brush hard, mountains rise, their peaks capped with clouds that taste faintly of winter apples.

Then the colors around you—once wild and unanchored—begin curling inward, drawn to the painting in gravitational spirals. Reds slip off distant hills, blues drain from rivers that never ran the same direction twice, yellows peel from the undersides of treetops shaped like question marks. Everything the dreamworld was bleeding, it now offers to your growing masterpiece.

You hesitate. A shadow of emptiness crosses the landscape: all that remains unclaimed is a thin, gray hush. Have you robbed this place to feed your vision? You glance at the brush, heavy with stolen wonder. A pang of responsibility—or is it love?—moves through you, and you make one last, careful stroke.

Instead of adding, you give back. From the brush flows a quiet silver, the tone of dawn moments before birds decide to sing. It spreads across the blank places, gentle and spacious, inviting new colors to arise on their own terms. Balance returns: distant hills inhale fresh greens, skies sip new violets, rivers find blues no dreamer has named.

Satisfied, you step away. The canvas—as tall as the sky—ripples once more and solidifies. In its depths you glimpse your own silhouette, holding the brush, but the figure smiles independently of your face and nods a thank-you.

The world exhales. The brush dissolves into a sigh of starlight. You feel gravity loosen; your feet lift from the ground. As you rise, the painted horizon tilts like a closing book, and the final thing you see is a single line of text written where your first stroke began:

“Dreamers create the colors the waking world will need.”

With that, the scene folds into a soft white brightness, and you awaken—heart still echoing with turquoise laughter, fingertips tingling with silver dawn.
