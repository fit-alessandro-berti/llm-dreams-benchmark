# The Dream Continues...

...build a library.

It seems illogical—maybe it is—but in this crumbling concrete city where most people hoard ammunition and canned goods, you become obsessed with collecting books.

You start in an abandoned school, filling your backpack with water-damaged volumes. *Pride and Prejudice*. A field guide to birds that will never sing again. Engineering textbooks. Poetry. It doesn't matter if pages are missing.

Others think you're mad. A trader offers you a working generator for three books—a real generator—and you refuse. Your friend Sarah says you'll starve preserving dead words.

But then people start coming.

First it's a teenager who teaches herself medicine from an old anatomy textbook. Then an old man who just wants to remember what the world looked like before. A child who has never seen pictures of animals.

The library becomes more than survival. It becomes memory, and dream, and proof that humans are more than just hunger.

You wake before you learn if it survives the winter.
