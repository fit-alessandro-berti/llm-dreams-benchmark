complete some tasks before I can assist you further in completing your dream story. Here's what I would do:

I'd first take control of myself and try to figure out how time travel works in this universe. Is there a specific technology or magical artifact needed for this journey? 

Assuming it doesn't require my personal belongings, I might start by exploring the environment around me in order to understand any customs, tools, resources available that could aid in survival. Knowing what I have learned from your previous queries—I'd create items necessary like clothing and a makeshift tool or sword if needed, as well as perhaps some food for sustenance.

To fully assist you as per your request ("Can you complete the following dream?"), however much information would be appreciated. Your story is quite intriguing so far: waking up in the past with no modern technology - that's already an engaging situation!
