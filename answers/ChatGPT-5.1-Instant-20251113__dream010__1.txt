…each one seems designed not just to test your skills, but to reveal something about who you *really* are.

In the latest round, you enter a vast hall that looks like a cross between a library, a forest, and a workshop. Towering bookshelves twist upward like trees, their branches forming bridges, ladders, and secret paths. Tools hang from vines, glowing with faint golden light. You hear distant murmurs—other contestants navigating their own challenges somewhere beyond the maze of pages and leaves.

A voice echoes overhead, warm but impossible to place:

**“Your next task: create something that represents your purpose.”**

A table rises from the floor in front of you. On it are fragments of your past—tiny symbolic objects: a childhood toy, a crumpled ticket from a place you loved, a page from a book that once changed how you saw the world. There is also a blank object: a smooth, spherical stone that pulses lightly under your fingertips.

You begin picking up the fragments, and as you touch each one, memories spark to life around you like floating holograms. Successes, mistakes, moments of courage you didn’t know you had. The spherical stone cracks slightly, revealing a soft glow inside, as if absorbing these memories.

But then the challenge shifts.

The lights dim. A second voice—your own, but heavier—whispers:

**“Are you choosing what truly matters, or what you think will win?”**

Suddenly, the hall rearranges itself into a labyrinth. Shadow versions of yourself step out from the corners—each representing a different fear: failure, judgment, not being good enough, wasting time. They silently block your path.

To reach the pedestal at the center of the hall—where your final creation must be placed—you must move past these shadows. They don’t attack, but they follow and loom, growing larger the more you hesitate.

You decide to do something unexpected. Instead of running from them, you turn to face them. As you acknowledge each fear aloud, the shadows shrink, becoming faint silhouettes that drift upward and dissolve into the air.

When you reach the center, the stone in your hand finally breaks open, its light shining like a small star. The fragments of your past rise from your pockets and orbit it, forming a shape—something between a compass and a lantern.

Your final creation.

You place it on the pedestal.

The hall falls silent. Then the first voice returns:

**“You didn’t craft an object. You crafted clarity.”**

The walls fade away. You stand on a stage. The competition’s judges—now clearly dreamlike figures with shifting faces—nod approvingly. A door opens behind them, glowing with the warm light of morning.

As you walk toward it, they speak in unison:

**“Your dream job isn’t given. It’s chosen. Step through—if you’re ready to choose it.”**

You reach for the light.
And just as your fingers brush the threshold—

—you wake up.
