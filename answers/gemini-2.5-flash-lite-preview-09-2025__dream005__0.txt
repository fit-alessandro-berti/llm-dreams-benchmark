You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and **each encounter is a fleeting, almost surreal tableau, hinting at a narrative you can't quite grasp.**

The first group you approach is clustered around a grand piano, but the pianist is playing with their elbows, creating a sound that is both beautiful and slightly agonizing—a shimmering cascade of wrong notes. They nod vaguely at you, their eyes glazed over with concentration, and you realize they aren't playing music, but *translating* something whispered in the air.

Next, you wander past a circle where people are earnestly debating the flavor profiles of various colored shadows. One woman, wearing a hat made entirely of dried lavender, insists that 'Midnight Blue' tastes distinctly of regret and ozone, while a man across from her argues vehemently that all shadows share the fundamental note of cool, freshly dug earth.

As you weave through the crowd, the lighting begins to shift—it’s not electric, but seems to emanate from the very fabric of people’s clothing, glowing softly in shades of amber and deep moss green. You spot a flash of the familiar jacket belonging to the one person you know, only to have them dissolve into a column of gently swirling confetti just as you call their name.

Then you find yourself standing before a buffet table that stretches impossibly far. The food is laid out, but everything is made of polished wood or intricately carved stone. You pick up what looks like a perfectly ripe tomato, only to find it's a heavy, cool piece of jasper. A waiter with a face made entirely of smooth, white porcelain glides up to you, offering a silver tray piled high with tiny, ticking clocks instead of canapés. He smiles without moving his lips and whispers, "They’re counting down to the introduction."

The air grows thick with the scent of old paper and distant rain. You push past a set of velvet curtains, expecting another room, but instead find yourself looking out over a vast, silent ocean under a sky filled with two moons.

Finally, you see them. Your single familiar person, standing on a small, rickety pier jutting out over the water. They are waving frantically, their face alight with relief. You start to run toward them, the strange crowds fading behind you, the sound of the elbow-pianist growing faint.

You reach the end of the pier. As you step onto the weathered wood, your friend opens their mouth to finally speak, but instead of words, a single, perfectly formed soap bubble floats out, catches the light of the twin moons, and drifts slowly over the water.

You look down at your own hands, and realize they are beginning to feel translucent, just like the bubble. You know, with the deep, unshakable logic of dreams, that if you touch your friend now, you will both simply turn into the echo of a very pleasant conversation you never actually had.

You hesitate, caught between the urgent need for recognition and the profound beauty of the dissolving moment, when suddenly, the pier beneath your feet begins to gently vibrate, and **you realize the entire social gathering—the room, the ocean, the moons—is simply the inside of a very large, resonating bell.**
