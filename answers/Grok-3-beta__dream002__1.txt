the sky darkens, casting an eerie shadow over the once serene forest. The wind begins to howl, whipping through the trees and sending leaves spiraling chaotically around you. You hear the distant rumble of thunder, and a cold shiver runs down your spine as the first drops of rain start to fall, heavy and unrelenting. Seeking shelter, you spot a small, overgrown path leading to a weathered cabin nestled between ancient oaks. 

As you approach, the cabin’s wooden door creaks open slightly, as if inviting you in. You hesitate, feeling an inexplicable mix of curiosity and unease, but the intensifying storm pushes you forward. Inside, the air is musty, and the flickering light of a dying fire in the hearth casts dancing shadows on the walls. You notice old photographs and trinkets scattered across a dusty table, hinting at a life once lived here.

Suddenly, you hear a faint whisper behind you, though no one is there. The voice seems to call your name, soft and mournful, echoing through the cabin. Your heart races as you turn around, searching for the source, but the room remains empty. The storm outside rages on, lightning illuminating the windows in sharp, fleeting bursts. You feel a strange pull toward a narrow staircase leading to the attic, as if something—or someone—is waiting for you up there.

Do you ascend the stairs, or do you stay and investigate the cabin further?
