As you approach the blank canvas, its surface ripples like liquid mercury. Suddenly, a paintbrush materializes in your hand—its bristles shimmering with stardust. The moment you touch brush to canvas, the world responds:  

**The First Stroke:**  
A slash of cobalt blue bleeds across the canvas, and instantly the sky above you fractures into a mosaic of sapphire shards. The air hums with the scent of ocean spray.  

**The Second Stroke:**  
You drag vermilion red in a wild spiral. The ground beneath your feet liquefies, swirling into a vortex of molten lava that solidifies into rose quartz mountains. Crimson butterflies with geometric wings flutter from the peaks, leaving trails of glittering embers.  

**The Third Stroke:**  
A dab of gold erupts into a supernova at the canvas’s center. The explosion births a floating garden—flowers with petals like stained glass, stems twisting into fractal spirals. One bloom turns to you and whispers, *"Shape the silence."*  

**The Fourth Stroke:**  
You sweep emerald green in broad arcs. The garden’s roots plunge downward, weaving into a labyrinth of neon vines that pulse with bioluminescence. Shadows detach themselves from the leaves, becoming ink-black foxes with kaleidoscope eyes. They circle you, murmuring riddles in a language of chimes.  

**The Final Touch:**  
As you lift the brush, the canvas floats free, expanding until it becomes a doorway. Through it, you see a city where buildings are made of liquid light, bending like rainbows. A figure emerges—a being woven from constellations, holding a palette of pure void. It extends a hand, offering you a single, colorless seed.  

*"Plant this where dreams drown,"* it intones, its voice echoing from every direction at once.  

You blink—and wake clutching a phantom seed, its coolness lingering on your palm. The dream’s colors bleed into dawn.  

### What Happened?  
The canvas was a conduit: not just for paint, but for *consciousness*. Each stroke reshaped reality because you weren’t painting *on* the dream—you were painting *with* it. The seed? A fragment of the void, waiting to be given form in another dream... or perhaps awake.
