You have no idea where you're going but somehow know that this path is supposed to lead you closer to understanding why nature's fury is upon you. As you stumble towards a massive oak tree, its branches seem to stretch like welcoming arms shielding you from the impending storm. 

As night begins to fall around you, soft luminescent mushrooms start sprouting everywhere on the forest floor, illuminating your path ahead and lighting up faces that look just like old friends from childhood memories. Underneath their gentle glow, laughter echoes through the trees - it's as if they've been reunited with each other after many years apart but now have something new to share... a reason why this happens during the storm instead of when you normally think thunderstorms occur.

Suddenly, amidst this spectacle of life finding strength in adversity, there appears an old wise woman standing by her tree, holding its branches gently as if she has always been here to nurture these young spirits of your past selves. She reveals that storms symbolize transformation - just like how darkness makes light brighter and stormy seas teach us endurance and resilience, our lives too would change into something wonderful once we face challenges head-on.

And with this newfound understanding, the storm subsides not because it heard an order but simply because it recognized what was true about itself; a storm becomes still if one understands their purpose isn't destructive but rather necessary for growth and renewal - much like you yourself need these experiences to become stronger versions of who you are meant to be.
