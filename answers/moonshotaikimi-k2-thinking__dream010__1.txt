suddenly find yourself standing in a vast, white room with no doors. The judges—your childhood teacher, a famous CEO, and your future self—sit behind a desk made of clouds. They hand you a single paper clip and say, "Show us your potential."

The first challenge begins. The paper clip straightens itself into a tiny silver key. You look up and the room has transformed into a labyrinth of glass walls, each pane reflecting a different version of you: the one who dropped out, the one who played it safe, the one who never tried. You must find the *real* you before the others catch up.

You run, but your feet feel like they're sinking into warm taffy. The glass versions are gaining. One of them whispers your biggest fear—that you're an imposter, that you've never been qualified. You look at the key in your palm and realize it's growing hot, burning an imprint into your skin: the word "ENOUGH."

The maze dissolves. Now you're on a stage, but the audience is made of everyone you've ever disappointed. The second challenge: deliver a presentation about your greatest failure, but all the words in your mouth have turned to sand. Every time you try to speak, the sand spills out, piling at your feet until you're standing on a dune. The higher the dune grows, the more the audience fades into shadow. You realize the sand isn't suffocating you—it's becoming the foundation you're standing on.

The final challenge appears without warning. You're back in the white room, but now it's filled with desks, each one occupied by someone wearing your face. The judges are gone. A sign reads: "Pick your replacement." You walk the rows, seeing version after version of you—more confident, more skilled, more deserving. Your hand reaches toward one, then stops.

You sit down at an empty desk instead.

The room erupts in applause. The walls crack open, revealing not a job offer, but a mirror. You look into it and see not who you could be, but who you always were—the person who kept sitting down when every instinct said to run. The paper clip key in your pocket hums.

You wake up. Your phone shows a rejection email from a real company. But your hand is clenched around something small and warm. When you open it, it's empty—except for a faint silver imprint that reads: "ENOUGH."
