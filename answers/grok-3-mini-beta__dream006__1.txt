and you begin to speak, your voice echoing through the vast hall with a confidence you don't quite feel. The words flow at first—something about innovation and change, scripted in your mind for weeks—but as the crowd leans in, their faces blurring into a sea of expectant eyes, you realize you're forgetting the next line. Panic rises like a tide; the microphone feels slippery in your hand, and suddenly, the audience starts morphing. What was once a room full of people transforms into a forest of giant, nodding sunflowers, their petals whispering your name in the wind. You try to laugh it off, but your laughter turns into a melody, and now you're not just speaking—you're singing an opera in a language you don't understand. The sunflowers applaud with rustling leaves, and just as you hit a high note, the stage dissolves beneath you, leaving you floating in a starry void, wondering if this is the speech of your life or just the start of something even wilder.
