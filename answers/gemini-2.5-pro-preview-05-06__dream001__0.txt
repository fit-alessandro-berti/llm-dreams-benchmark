Okay, here we go:

You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to **frantically pat your pockets, a cold dread washing over you. No phone. No wallet. No crumpled piece of paper with an address. Just the smooth, empty fabric of your trousers and jacket.**

The buildings around you seem to lean in, their windows like a thousand unblinking eyes. The architecture is a bewildering mix of ornate, gothic spires piercing impossibly modern chrome structures that reflect the bruised-purple sky. The sounds are a cacophony: distant, mournful horns, the clatter of what sounds like a million tiny spoons, and a language you don't recognize, lilting and sharp.

"Excuse me!" you call out to a woman hurrying past, her hat adorned with what look like miniature, slowly revolving teacups. She doesn't even glance your way, her pace unwavering.

Panic claws at your throat. You need to find *someone*, *something*. You spot a kiosk, its sign written in glowing, shifting symbols. Behind the counter, a creature with too many fingers is meticulously polishing a single, luminous orb.

"Please," you stammer, approaching, "I have a meeting... a very important meeting... the... the Grand Converging Plaza? Or maybe it was the Central Nexus Hub?" The names feel slippery, like eels in your mind.

The many-fingered creature slowly raises its head, its eyes like polished obsidian. It doesn't speak, but instead points one long, delicate finger towards a narrow, shadowed alleyway that seems to vibrate faintly.

Desperate, you plunge into the alley. The air grows cooler, smelling of damp stone and something sweet, like overripe fruit. The walls seem to press in, and the light from the main street dwindles. Just as you think it's a dead end, it opens into a small, circular courtyard.

In the center of the courtyard isn't a plaza or a hub, but a single, enormous, intricately carved wooden door. There's no handle, no knocker, just the rich, dark wood. Above it, a clock with no hands, only phases of the moon, shows a sliver of a crescent rapidly waxing towards full. That must mean time is running out!

As you stare, a section of the door, no bigger than a letterbox, slides open silently. Two bright, inquisitive eyes peer out. A soft, melodic voice, like wind chimes, says, "Password?"

"Password?" you echo, mind blank. "I... I don't know the password! I just know I'm terribly late for a very important meeting!"

The eyes blink slowly. "Indeed. The most important meetings often begin when you realize you're unprepared for the one you *thought* you were attending."

Then, the ground beneath you begins to feel like soft moss, and the edges of the courtyard start to blur and ripple, like a reflection in disturbed water. The eyes in the door seem to smile, and the melodic voice whispers, "Perhaps the meeting is *about* finding your way..."

And just as you're about to ask what that means, you feel yourself sinking, not unpleasantly, into the mossy ground, the scent of overripe fruit and damp earth filling your senses as the city, the door, and the urgent need for a meeting dissolve around you...
