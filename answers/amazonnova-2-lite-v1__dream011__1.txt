### **Dream Continuation:**

You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are **written in a language you don’t recognize**—a mix of symbols, shifting letters, and images that seem to change when you look at them too long. The paper feels warm in your hands, almost pulsing, like it’s alive.

The room around you begins to distort. The walls, once solid and familiar, now ripple like water, revealing glimpses of other versions of yourself—some sitting at the same desk, others standing in fields, still others floating in a dark void. Each version is holding a different exam booklet, and their faces reflect a range of emotions: calm, panicked, determined, or resigned.

You glance back at the first question:

> **"Define the foundation upon which your future will be built. Provide three examples of choices you have made that no longer apply to who you are now. Then, describe the self you are becoming."**

But as you try to write, the pen in your hand begins to glow. It is no longer ink, but a stream of light pouring from your fingers onto the paper, forming words you didn’t consciously think of—words that feel deeper than thought, more like memory or truth being uncovered.

Suddenly, the voice of your past self echoes from somewhere behind you:  
> *"You always overthink everything. Just write what you know."*

But another voice, softer and newer, whispers:  
> *"Or maybe… write what you feel."*

The exam booklet shifts again. Now it’s not multiple-choice or essay format—it’s blank, and you realize you are meant to *draw* your answer. You Hesitatingly pick up the glowing pen and begin to sketch.

You draw a tree with roots tangled in books, its branches reaching toward a sky filled with constellations shaped like doors. In the center of the trunk, you write your name—but it morphs into symbols that resemble DNA strands and musical notes.

As the drawing takes shape, memories flash through your mind:  
- The time you stood up for someone even though you were afraid.  
- The moment you abandoned a long-held dream to follow a new path.  
- The day you looked in the mirror and didn’t recognize the person staring back—an stranger who seemed both stranger and more *you* than ever before.

The room quiets. The shifting walls still, the other versions of you fade, and the glow from your pen dims just enough for you to see clearly.

You turn the page.

The next question appears:

> **"What will you sacrifice to keep becoming? And what must you release to make space for the next version of yourself?"**

You pause.

Then, without thinking, you begin to write…
