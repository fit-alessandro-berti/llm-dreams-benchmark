...you notice the rules are not what they seem. The challenges are not tests of skill, but of *character*. The head judge, a woman with eyes like polished river stones, watches not your performance, but your reaction to the performance of others.

The first challenge is a room filled with intricate clockwork puzzles. You are about to solve yours when you hear a whimper from the corner. A fellow competitor, a gentle man with ink-stained fingers, is weeping because his puzzle seems impossible, gears grinding to a halt. The judge raises an eyebrow at you. The clock is ticking. Do you finish your puzzle first, securing your lead? Or do you abandon your path to help him fix his?

In the second challenge, you are led into a vast library. You are told to find one specific book that contains the secret to the dream job. You scramble, climbing shelves, pulling volumes, but you realize the titles are shifting. You finally spot the book you need on the highest shelf, just as another competitor, a swift and ambitious woman, is reaching for it. She is taller, faster. She will get it first. But you notice the ladder is rickety and unstable beneath her. A sharp tug could send her falling. Do you let her take the prize? Or do you warn her, sacrificing the book but saving her from harm?

In the final challenge, the room is empty save for a single, heavy door. The river-stone-eyed judge stands beside it. "The dream job," she says, "is behind this door. It is yours. But to claim it, you must leave behind everything you brought with you—your notes, your tools, your lucky charms. You must enter with nothing but yourself." You look at your hands, filled with the knowledge you've gained and the tools you've earned. To let them go feels like a death. But you know, with a certainty that chills you, that the job is not the prize you thought it was. The prize was the person you had to become to win it.

You take a deep breath, place your tools on the floor, and push open the door.
