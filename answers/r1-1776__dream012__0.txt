**The Dream Continues...**

The ship lurches violently, a wall of black water crashing over the bow. Lightning splits the sky, illuminating faces etched with fear. Your first mate grips the wheel, shouting over the gale, "Captain—the helm’s not responding!" The mast groans like a dying beast, sails ripped to shreds. For a heartbeat, doubt creeps in: *Is this how it ends?*  

But your father’s voice echoes in your bones, weathered by a lifetime at sea: *"Storms test the timber of a soul, not the ship."* You bark orders, sharp as cannon fire. "Reef the remaining sails! All hands to the pumps—*move!*" The crew scrambles, galvanized by your resolve.  

You spot the flaw—a jammed rudder chain. Without hesitation, you grab a knife, rope, and lantern. "Tie me to the rail!" you roar. The crew hesitates, but a young deckhand, eyes wide as moons, obeys. You dive overboard, suspended above the abyss. Saltwater claws your vision, but your blade finds the chain, sawing through rust and seaweed. A wave slams you into the hull—*ribs crack*—but the rudder loosens.  

Back on deck, bloodied and shaking, you seize the wheel. "Hard to starboard!" The ship heaves, riding the storm’s wrath like a wild stallion. Hours blur. Then—a sliver of gold on the horizon. The clouds tear open, sunlight spilling onto calm azure.  

The crew collapses in exhausted awe. The young deckhand murmurs, "Never seen a storm bent to a man’s will." You smile grimly, watching the horizon. Somewhere, your father’s ghost nods.  

**The dream fades, but the sea’s rhythm lingers—a heartbeat, relentless and unafraid.**
