...plant a garden in the cracked concrete of what was once a city square.

The air tastes of dust and static, and shadows stretch long and thin across the skeletal remains of buildings. Your hands, calloused and stained with soil from a forgotten world, press into the grey residue of the pavement. You’ve salvaged a few scraps: a rusted trowel from a collapsed basement, a cracked plastic crate lined with salvaged fabric, and seeds—*real seeds*, preserved in tin foil for decades, found in the brittle pages of an old botany book.

You dig with desperate care, breaking through the hardened layer, revealing faint traces of dark earth beneath. It’s not much, but it’s *something*. You sprinkle the seeds—tiny, hopeful things: lettuce, radish, sunflowers. You water them with collected rainwater, filtering it through layers of cloth and charcoal. You whisper to the soil, “Come back. Just once. *Please*.”

In the quiet that follows, you hear a sound: a tiny *crack*. Not of crumbling concrete, but of life pushing through. A green shoot, impossibly bright, breaks the surface. You gasp, tears cutting paths through the grime on your cheeks.

And then, a rustle in the overgrown ruin across the square. A figure emerges—thin, cloaked in rags, eyes wide but weary. They stop, staring not at you, but at the plant. Slowly, hesitantly, they kneel beside you. No words. Just a hand, trembling, brushing the tiny green stem.

For the first time in years, you aren’t just surviving.

You’re *remembering*. 

And that, in a world turned to ash, feels like magic.
