The questions are **written in a language you don't recognize – swirling, shifting symbols that seem to pulse faintly on the page.** You blink, rub your eyes, but the symbols remain, utterly alien. Panic starts as a cold trickle down your spine. You glance around the silent exam hall. Everyone else is scribbling furiously, heads down, seemingly understanding perfectly.

You flip through the pages desperately. Each question is worse than the last:
1.  **Page 1:** The symbols rearrange themselves into what looks vaguely like a complex chemical equation, but the elements are unfamiliar, glowing with impossible colors.
2.  **Page 2:** The text flows like water, forming intricate, three-dimensional geometric shapes that defy Euclidean geometry. A faint hum seems to emanate from the page.
3.  **Page 3:** It appears to be a philosophical treatise, but the concepts twist and writhe, promising profound insight just beyond your grasp, leaving you with a profound sense of vertigo.
4.  **Page 4:** Pure, abstract emotion washes over you – waves of despair, flickers of impossible joy, and a crushing sense of cosmic insignificance – conveyed solely through the visual patterns.

Your pen feels heavy and strange in your hand. You look down – it's melting, dripping dark, iridescent ink onto the desk, forming its own tiny, incomprehensible script. The clock on the wall ticks backwards, then forwards at double speed, then stops entirely.

Suddenly, the stern-faced professor stands beside your desk. He leans down, his eyes impossibly deep and dark, like pools of ink reflecting distant stars. He doesn't speak, but his voice echoes directly in your mind:

**"The questions are not on the paper. They are within the space between the symbols. Within the silence of the room. Within the rhythm of your own frantic heartbeat. Can you perceive the true examination?"**

He gestures towards the paper. As you look back, the symbols dissolve into shimmering mist, leaving the pages utterly blank. Yet, the *feeling* of being tested intensifies a hundredfold. The pressure isn't about recalling facts anymore; it's about confronting the terrifying, beautiful, incomprehensible void of possibility itself. The future career isn't just a job; it's the fundamental shape your existence will take in the face of the unknown.

The whispers of your classmates become fragmented echoes:
*   "...the angle of perception..."
*   "...must resonate with the substrate..."
*   "...choose the impossible path..."

**What do you do?**

*   **A) Close your eyes.** Breathe deeply, shutting out the visual chaos. Focus inward, trying to feel the "questions" the professor mentioned in the silence and your own being. Seek an answer not in knowledge, but in intuition or acceptance.
*   **B) Grab the melting pen.** Use the strange, iridescent ink pooling on your desk to start drawing *your own* symbols, patterns, or equations onto the blank page. Respond to the void not with answers, but with creation, defiance, or a map of your own confusion.
*   **C) Stand up.** Walk away from the desk. Approach the professor or the blank clock on the wall. Decide that the true test is refusing to play by the impossible rules presented. Seek a different path entirely.

**The dream awaits your choice... What does this mean for your future?**
