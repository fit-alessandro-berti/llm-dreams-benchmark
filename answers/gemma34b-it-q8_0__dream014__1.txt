You are feeling a thick layer of humidity clinging to your wool coat as you're lost within the relentless throb of the city – a concrete ocean of rushing feet and roaring yellow cabs. Buildings loomed, impossible to read, their glass reflecting a distorted version of your anxious face. Everything seemed urgent and overwhelming, pulling you in conflicting directions. You clutched your worn messenger bags tighter, a pathetic comfort against the rising panic. You’d taken a wrong turn three alleys over, each one a carbon copy of the last, and now felt utterly, profoundly alone.

Suddenly, a group of hands appeared before you, gentle but firm, steering you towards a less constricted space. It was a collection - an old woman with silver braids piled neatly atop her head reading a tattered book, a young busker strumming a surprisingly melancholic tune on a battered violin, a quiet man in a sharp suit holding a briefcase and, most interestingly, a vibrant street artist wearing a smear of purple paint across his cheek. “Let the storm pass, dear traveler," the street artist smiled, his turquoise eyes twinkling. “You look utterly discombobulated.”

“I… I know,” you stammer breathed, “I'm supposed to be meeting someone here, near Luminary Park… but I have absolutely no idea where I am. Everything just... blends together.”

“Don't worry," the old woman replied, holding out her book, a page turned open to a detailed street directory drawn in intricate pen and ink. “Maps have eyes only if you let them see you. We’ve all been lost, in one direction or another.”

The man in the suit, surprisingly, joined the group. He pushed open a compartment in his briefcase, pulling out, not papers, but a perfectly shaped marigold. He pressed it gently into your hand. "Carry this,” he said quietly. “It brings clarity.”

Without asking, they began to gently, deliberately guide you. The violinist continued to play, his melody shifting and subtly adapting, like a reflection of your unspoken anxieties dissolving. There was no pressure, no direction or impatience emanating from them. They simply flowed around you, forming a living, breathing current in the chaos of the city. 



... But as we turn down a familiar-looking cobblestone street, I realize the music stops. The marigilod wilts, crumbling in my hand. The faces of the kind strangers fade slightly, becoming...transparent.  I reach out to grasp at one's hand again, but they slip through my fingers.  The city suddenly shifts, morphing into an endless field of sunflowers, all identical and silently watching. And then, I understand – *this* isn’t a city. It's the memory of being lost, revisited again and again in perfect, heartbreaking detail... each time yearning, just barely, for the comforting presence of strangers, hoping someone *kever* knows the way back.  The overwhelming loneliness returns, stronger than ever, and I wake with the salty grit of tears on my cheeks and the faint smell of marigolds hanging in the air.
