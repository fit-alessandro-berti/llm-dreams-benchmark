You are dreaming. Can you complete the following dream?  

You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and...  

**The air turns thick and electric**, like licking a battery. The birdsong cuts off mid-note—a silence so abrupt it *hums* in your ears. Sunlight, moments ago dappled gold through the oaks, vanishes. Not blocked by clouds, but *sucked away*. The forest darkens as if dusk fell in seconds.  

Wind slams into you—not from one direction, but *all* at once—ripping leaves from branches like tearing paper. The trees don’t sway; they **wrench sideways**, roots groaning as if the earth itself is heaving. Rain doesn’t fall—it *hurls* down in silver sheets, cold enough to burn. Your clothes soak through instantly, heavy as chains.  

Then you smell it: **ozone and wet iron**. Not lightning—something *older*. You glance up. The sky isn’t storm-gray. It’s *purple*, swirling like oil on water. Thunder cracks, but it’s not a boom—it’s a **voice**, low and guttural, speaking words you can’t understand but *feel* in your bones: *"Too late. Too late. Too late."*  

A flash—not light, but *darkness*—and the forest transforms. The path you walked vanishes. The trees twist into blackened claws, their bark peeling like burnt skin. Something moves in the rain: figures, tall and thin, with too many joints, slipping between trunks. They don’t walk—they *unfold*, silent as shadows. One turns its face toward you. Where eyes should be, there’s only **still water**, reflecting your own terrified expression back at you.  

The voice again, inside your head now: ***"Run, but you won’t outrun the storm. It’s not outside. It’s in your blood."***  

You bolt. Your feet churn mud, but the path stretches infinitely. The figures glide closer. Rain stings your eyes—but when you wipe them, your hands come away **stained crimson**. The storm isn’t water. It’s *tears*. The forest is crying, and the tears are yours.  

Suddenly—a single note of birdsong. Clear, impossibly bright. The purple sky rips open. Sunlight spills through, warm on your face. The trees stand tall and green again. The mud underfoot is just dirt. The rain has stopped. You’re dry.  

But in your hand, you clutch a single **black feather**, still damp with rain that never was. And the voice whispers one last time, not in fear, but in sorrow:  
***"You left the door open."***  

You jolt awake. Your room is quiet. Sunlight streams through the window. But your pillow is damp… and clutched in your fist is a feather—dark as a shadow, smelling faintly of rain and iron.  

*(You are dreaming. Or are you?)*
