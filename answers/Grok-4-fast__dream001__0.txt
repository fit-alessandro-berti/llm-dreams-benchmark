You start to wander the labyrinthine streets, where skyscrapers twist like melting clocks and the sidewalks pulse faintly underfoot, as if the city itself is breathing. Neon signs flicker in languages you almost understand—hieroglyphs of coffee cups and winged shoes—promising directions that dissolve into riddles when you get close. Your phone, clutched in a hand that feels both yours and not, shows a map that's a swirling vortex of stars, the meeting location marked only as "The Heart of Echoes."

Panic bubbles up, but it's laced with a strange thrill, like chasing a shadow you secretly want to catch. You hail a cab that's more beetle than car, its driver a fox in a pinstripe suit who grins with too many teeth. "The meeting? Oh, it's wherever you left your shadow," he says, and suddenly the streets blur into a carousel of memories: your childhood treehouse perched on a billboard, a forgotten lover waving from a cloud-shrouded balcony.

The cab lurches to a halt before a grand archway of living vines, blooming with glowing invitations. You step out, heart pounding, and there it is—the meeting room, a vast greenhouse orbiting the moon. Inside, faces from your life (and a few from fevered books) argue passionately over tea served in thimbles. You're late, gloriously so, and as you take your seat at the center of it all, the fox driver slides in beside you, whispering, "Dreams don't have agendas, kid. What's the rush?"

You laugh, and the world tilts, the greenhouse blooming into daylight. Your eyes flutter open to the familiar ceiling fan, the alarm's soft beep pulling you back. But for a moment, you swear you can still hear the city's breath, waiting for you to return.
