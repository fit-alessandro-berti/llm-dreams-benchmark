...and you reach for the file, but the moment your fingertips graze the cover, it dissolves into a swarm of blue butterflies that scatter into the fluorescent lights. You try to speak, to explain, but your voice comes out as the sound of rain on a tin roof. 

Your boss nods solemnly, their face shifting like a glitching video screen, and points to the clock. The clock has no hands, only a single eye that blinks at you, counting down in heartbeats instead of seconds. The walls of the office begin to breathe, pulsing inward, and the carpet turns into thick, green moss. 

You feel the panic rise in your throat, but then you notice your feet are no longer touching the ground. The "impossible deadline" isn't a time anymore; it's a tide. Water starts seeping from the vents, not cold, but warm like bathwater. The boss sinks beneath the rising surface without struggling, becoming a mannequin made of driftwood. 

You realize then that the project was never meant to be finished. It was just an anchor. So you stop trying to swim, let your lungs fill with light, and float upward through the ceiling, drifting into the sky until the sound of your alarm clock pulls you back to shore.
