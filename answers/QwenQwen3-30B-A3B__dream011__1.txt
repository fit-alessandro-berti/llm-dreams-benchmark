You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language that shifts and swirls like ink in water—words morphing into symbols, then into fragments of memories. One question reads: *"What if your greatest strength is the reason you fail?"* Another says, *"Answer truthfully, but remember: truth is a mirror, and you may not like what it shows."*  

The exam paper is blank, but as you stare, it fills with text that seems to bleed from your own thoughts. You try to write, but your pen floats mid-air, refusing to touch the page. Around you, the classroom dissolves into a vast, echoing void. Shadows of past failures whisper in your ear, while a voice booms, *"This isn’t about knowledge—it’s about what you’re willing to sacrifice."*  

Suddenly, the questions rearrange themselves into a single, impossible prompt: *"Choose: Your dream job, or the life you’ve always feared."* The options are etched in glowing, trembling letters. Your hands shake. The clock ticks backward. And somewhere, a door creaks open—uninvited, unmarked—leading to a hallway you’ve never seen, where the walls pulse like a heartbeat.  

What do you do?
