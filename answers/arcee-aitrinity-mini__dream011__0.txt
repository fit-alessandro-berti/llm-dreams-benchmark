The questions begin to shift. They're not just difficult; they're *impossible*. Instead of straightforward exams on thermodynamics or literature, they manifest as:

1.  **A quantum physics question written in glowing neon letters floating in the air.** "Explain the unified theory connecting consciousness with quantum entanglement, using only the color red as a metaphor, within the time it takes for a neutrino to cross the solar system. Show your work in fractal geometry."
2.  **A complex historical analysis question projected onto the classroom wall.** "Analyze the economic policies of the fictional 23rd-century empire of Zetar, drawing direct parallels to the cultural revolutions of 1968, while simultaneously resolving the philosophical inconsistencies between Hume, Kant, and a newly discovered 9th-century Sanskrit manuscript, *all* while factoring in the unintended consequences of parallel universe travel. Justify your methodology using only haiku."
3.  **A simple, haunting question appears at your desk.** It's stark and ancient: **"What is the sound of one hand clapping?"**
4.  **The questions stop shifting. They become overwhelming.** Thousands of questions, each more bizarre and impossibly complex than the last, swirl around you – equations in impossible languages, fragments of philosophical arguments, images of things you've never seen, demands for solutions to problems that seem to violate the fundamental laws of reality and logic.

**As you stare in bewildered panic, the dream shifts.**

The classroom dissolves. The exam hall isn't real. The questions aren't real. You're standing at the edge of a vast, endless, featureless plain under a sky that seems both day and night simultaneously. The *concept* of the exam, the weight of your future, the impossible burden of the questions, now feels like an immense, invisible weight pressing down on your chest. The plain stretches infinitely in all directions, devoid of any mark, any hope, any path forward. The silence is deafening, echoing the absence of answers that should be there but aren't.

**The dream ends there, hanging in that overwhelming silence, leaving you with the profound, unsettling feeling that the final exam wasn't just a test of knowledge, but a test of sanity itself.** The future feels irrevocably lost, swallowed by the impossible questions that never found their answers, and the plain offers no refuge from the crushing weight of that realization. You wake up gasping, the echoes of impossible questions still ringing in your mind, wondering if the dream was a warning about the pressures you face, or simply a fragment of your own mind's terrifying, unanswerable riddles.
