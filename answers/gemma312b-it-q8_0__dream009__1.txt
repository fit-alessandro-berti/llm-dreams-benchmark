You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find something to eat, fast. Dust muddled the setting sun into long, orange streaks across a field of swaying, unfamiliar greenery. It wasn's farmland - thick, interwoven plants like nothing I'd ever seen filled a landscape that stretched as far as the eye could see. And the air, thick and sweet with pollen, prickled against my tongue. 

My head throbbed. One minute, I was browsing YouTube; the next… this. The clothing on my back was bizarre – roughspun tunic and what looked like woven straw sandals. This felt… medieval. Ancient even. Forget Wi-Fi – I couldn’t even tell what time it was.

I stumbled along, pushing past giant blooms larger than my own head, when I saw smoke on the breeze. Hope flared within me! Maybe there would be people.  A scattering of grey stone shapes revealed themselves nestled between a steep rise and the unfamiliar vegetation – a village. 

The closer I got, the clearer it became. Ramshackle houses, built with stones chinked with mud. Chickens pecked in the dirt, and goats milled nervously nearby, watched over by a lone shepherd with weathered face and sheepskin cloak. The aroma of roasting… something smoky and meaty made my stomach rumble urgently.

As cautiously as I could – attracting attention was *not* on my to-do list – I entered the settlement. People paused to stare, their gazes wary and filled with questions I suspected I couldn't begin to answer without further inciting confusion. All conversation ceased. 

Finally, a girl, no older than ten, broke away from a cluster of women mending nets. She approached me with wide, scared eyes, holding out a flatbread dusted with something herbal. "...Are... you alright, good sir?" she asked in a lulling language that felt strangely familiar on the edge of recognition. My attempts at speaking English got blank stares, but I smiled gratefully – understanding wasn't language, surely? – and took the bread.  

It was dry and nutty and unexpectedly filling. While nibbling on it, I watched as the little girl’s mother, a sturdy, woman with calloused hands and kind eyes, beckoned hesitantly.  Apparently, mere sustenance, and a polite smile, wasn't enough to be completely accepted. To earn their trust, to *survive* in this strange past life, I realized I needed…**master a useful skill of this age quickly, ideally one that involved hands and didn’t require explaining YouTube.**



That’s my current pressing desire. Which skill, though? Weaving? Carpentry?  Blacksmithing…? The possibilities felt overwhelming and profoundly frightening with the sun sinking low towards the horizon – a horizon unmarred by telephone wires, satellites, or streetlights. Tonight I would eat. But tomorrow… tomorrow would require action.
