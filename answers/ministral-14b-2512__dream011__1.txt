**The Exam That Wasn’t There**

The moment you sit down, the paper in front of you isn’t just blank—it’s *wrong*. The questions aren’t written in ink; they’re carved into the surface like ancient runes, shifting slightly when you blink. The first one reads:

**"What would you do if the answer you *know* is the one that destroys everything you love?"**

Before you can react, the next question pulses to life, its letters rearranging into a mirror of your own handwriting—except the words are in a language you’ve never seen, yet you *understand* them instantly. It whispers:

**"The door at the end of the hall has your name on it. Do you open it?"**

A cold draft slithers under the desk. You glance up, and the proctor—a figure you’ve never met, but whose face is somehow *familiar*, like a half-remembered dream—smiles and says, *"Time’s up."* The clock on the wall spins backward, its hands melting into smoke.

Then the paper dissolves into ash, and you’re standing in a hallway you’ve walked a thousand times before. The door at the end is slightly ajar. Inside, you see *yourself*—older, exhausted, holding a single sheet of paper with a single word scrawled across it:

**"Begin."**

**Would you like to explore:**
- **The language of the questions?** (It might be the voice of your subconscious—or something older.)
- **The door’s contents?** (Is it a choice, a trap, or a loop?)
- **The proctor’s identity?** (Are they a guide, a trickster, or a version of you?)
- **The "final exam" itself?** (Is it really about a career, or about *you*?)
