…notice that the puzzles become more intricate, their symbols shifting and glowing faintly as if alive. The air thickens with anticipation. Each time you solve a puzzle, a cool breeze sweeps through the stone corridors, whisking away your doubts for an instant. As you move deeper into the maze, you find that the walls ripple gently at your touch, and sometimes you glimpse reflections—memory fragments—caught in their surfaces.

In one chamber, an enormous clockwork mechanism blocks your path. Its hands spin erratically, powered by riddles whispered out of nowhere. You must listen carefully, piecing together clues, senses sharpening as you try to match the rhythm of your heartbeat to the ticking.

Past the clockwork room, the maze narrows. Odd, flickering lights draw you onward. Instead of puzzles on pedestals, now the entire environment is the puzzle: floors tilt when you step, and the ceiling rearranges itself behind you, making retreat impossible. The sense of urgency increases, driving you forward.

At last, you reach a chamber with a domed ceiling made of mirrors. In the center, a pedestal holds an unlit lantern and a puzzle box, its surface covered with shifting glyphs you recognize faintly from old dreams. Solving this final challenge means all the doors will open at once. But as you lean closer, the maze—your mind—whispers a new question: 

What will you find if you solve the puzzle... and what, exactly, are you searching for?
