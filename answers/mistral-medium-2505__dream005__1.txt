**Dream Continuation:**

As you weave through the crowd, the hum of conversation and laughter swirls around you. The room is vast—high ceilings, flickering chandeliers, and clusters of people engaged in animated discussions. You spot a group near a grand fireplace, their faces illuminated by the warm glow. One of them, a woman with a mischievous smile, waves you over.

*"You look lost,"* she says, her voice playful. *"Come join us—we’re debating the best way to travel through time."*

Before you can respond, the group erupts into competing theories—some argue for ancient rituals, others for futuristic machines. You laugh, but your eyes keep scanning the room. Then, a familiar voice calls your name.

There, near a towering bookshelf, is the one person you know—your friend, holding two glasses of something sparkling. *"Took you long enough,"* they say, grinning. *"I’ve been saving you from the time-travel enthusiasts."*

As you step toward them, the room shifts subtly—the walls stretch, the crowd blurs, and suddenly, you’re both standing in a quiet garden under a starry sky. Your friend hands you a glass. *"Dreams are funny like that,"* they murmur. *"You never know where they’ll take you."*

And just as you’re about to reply, the scene dissolves into something new—perhaps a door opening, a whisper in the wind, or the sudden sensation of floating.

**How would you like the dream to unfold next?**
