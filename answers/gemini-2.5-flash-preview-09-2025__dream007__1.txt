...and you decide to stop talking, not out of surrender, but because the words feel like they’ve become too heavy, thick, and brown, like wet clay clinging to the inside of your mouth.

As the sound cuts out, the energy doesn't dissipate; it crystallizes. The air around you shimmers violently, and the cramped library you were arguing in suddenly melts. The floor gives way, and you find yourself standing not on wood, but on a vast, vibrating sheet of taut silver water.

Your friend’s furious face begins to ripple, losing its sharp definition. The anger drains out of their eyes, replaced by a soft, glowing, internal blue light, like the heart of a captured star. The crucial, important thing you were fighting over—which you realize you can no longer remember—has transformed into a large, shimmering, obsidian key that hovers exactly equidistant between your chest and theirs.

You look down at your hands. They are no longer your hands; they are carved from smooth white stone, perfect and cold. You and your friend are now mirror images of each other, eternally poised above the deep, silent silver pool.

The argument hasn't ended, it has merely changed mediums. You realize that the only way to resolve the conflict is not to grab the key, but to synchronize your breathing. If either of you takes a breath that is too shallow or too deep, the key will shatter, and the silver water will rise up to claim you both.

So, standing there in the humid, silent glow, you both begin the impossible task: breathing together, perfectly, focusing every fragment of your emotional intensity not on being right, but on achieving absolute, shared stillness. And you know, deep in your stone chest, that you could stand there holding that shared breath for an eternity.
