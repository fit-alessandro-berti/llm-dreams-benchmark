As you move deeper into the maze, you encounter a colossal door etched with shifting symbols that seem to breathe in the dim light. The air hums with latent energy, and a disembodied voice echoes: "Truth lies in patterns unseen." Before you, three pedestals rise from the floor—each holding an object: a fractured crystal prism, a clock with missing hands, and an ink-stained quill.  

You realize this puzzle demands synesthesia—*solving with senses beyond sight*. The prism must refract light onto the clock to reveal hidden numerals, while the quill’s ink, when applied to the door, exposes faint equations. Your mind races:  
1. **The Prism**: You align it to catch a beam from a crevice above, casting rainbow patterns that land on the clock’s face. Where violet light strikes, the number "VII" glows.  
2. **The Clock**: You place the missing hands at VII and III—*7:15*—the time when the maze’s shadow forms a key shape on the floor at dawn.  
3. **The Quill**: Dipping it in a pool of liquid shadow (gathered from the wall’s shifting crevices), you trace the equations revealed by the ink: `∇·E = ρ/ε₀` (Gauss’s law). The symbols on the door rearrange into a tessellating keyhole.  

The door grinds open. Beyond lies a garden of floating gears and burning roses, where fire blooms spin mathematical constants into golden thread. A path of glowing Fibonacci spirals beckons you toward a pulsing nexus of light—the maze’s heart.  

But as you step forward, the ground liquefies. You’re sinking into a sea of liquid logic, where numbers swirl like fish. *Concentrate*. The solution forms: swim toward the irrational (√2, √3, √5) to find buoyancy. You kick through the chaos, breath held, mind sharper than ever...  

*(The dream lingers—what awaits in the nexus?)*
