the air grows thicker, humming with an almost electric tension—like the moment before a storm breaks. The walls of the maze shift subtly around you, their surfaces no longer just stone but a living tapestry of shifting symbols: geometric patterns that pulse faintly, as if breathing. You reach out to touch one, and your fingers sink slightly into the surface, not like stone, but like the membrane of a soap bubble—resistant yet yielding. A whisper slithers into your ear, though no one is there:

*"The deeper you go, the more the maze remembers you."*

You press forward, and the puzzles grow stranger. One chamber holds a **mirror that does not reflect your face**, but instead shows a version of you from a future you’ve never lived—older, wearier, holding a key you don’t recognize. The inscription beneath it reads: *"What you seek is what you’ve already lost."* You stare at your other self, and for a heartbeat, she stares back—then reaches out, pressing her palm against the glass. The mirror shatters, and the fragments rearrange themselves into a **door**.

Beyond it, the maze splits into three paths:
1. **The Path of Echoes** – A corridor lined with statues of people you’ve known, but their faces are blurred, as if erased by time. Their voices murmur in unison: *"You were never here. You were never gone."*
2. **The Bridge of Unwritten Rules** – A narrow walkway over a chasm, its planks made of **equations** that shift when you step on them. The abyss below isn’t empty—it’s filled with **gears turning in slow, hypnotic motion**, and the deeper you look, the more you realize the gears are **teeth**, grinding against something vast and unseen.
3. **The Garden of Forgotten Choices** – A lush, overgrown space where every plant is a **metaphor made real**: vines that whisper regrets, flowers that bloom into memories you’ve suppressed, and a single **black rose** at the center, its petals unfolding to reveal a **clock face** with no hands. A voice—your own, but distorted—says: *"Pick the thorn. Or don’t. It doesn’t matter now."*

You hesitate. The maze *wants* you to choose, but the weight of the air suggests that **no path is the right one**. Then, from the corner of your eye, you notice something new: a **fourth option**, hidden behind a curtain of ivy. It wasn’t there a second ago. The ivy parts just enough to reveal a **staircase descending into darkness**, and at the bottom, a faint **blue light** flickers like a dying star.

A child’s laughter echoes from below.

**What do you do?**
*(Do you take one of the three paths, investigate the hidden staircase, or something else entirely? The dream is yours to shape.)*
