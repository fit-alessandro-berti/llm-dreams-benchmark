...realize that their voices don't match their movements. A tall man in a tuxedo is laughing heartily, but the sound coming from him is the low, mournful moo of a cow. You try to sidestep him, but the floor feels sticky, like taffy, slowing your steps.

You weave through a circle of women wearing ballgowns made entirely of crumpled blueprints. They are speaking in rapid-fire whispers, but when you lean in to ask if they’ve seen your friend, they all turn to look at you at once, revealing that they don't have eyes—just smooth, pale skin where their faces should be.

Panic starts to rise in your chest, cold and sharp. You spot your friend standing on a balcony across the massive hall. They are wearing the exact same outfit they wore to your high school graduation, even though the event is clearly a black-tie gala. You wave your arms to get their attention, shouting their name, but your voice comes out silent, like you’re shouting underwater.

You run toward the balcony, but the faster you move, the further away it seems to get. The room stretches and distorts, the walls expanding like an accordion. Just as you reach the stairs, the balustrade turns into a hedge of thorns. You look up, and your friend is no longer there. Instead, a giant grandfather clock stands where they were, its face spinning wildly, the hands ticking backward so fast they blur.

Suddenly, the music stops. The hundreds of faceless guests freeze mid-sentence and slowly turn their featureless heads directly toward you. A chandelier above you begins to melt like wax, dripping hot, glowing light onto the floor, which has turned into the surface of a calm, dark lake. You take a step back, your foot breaking the surface of the water, and you begin to sink, not down, but up—floating weightlessly toward the ceiling, watching the party shrink smaller and smaller until it’s just a speck of light in the distance.
