You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written not in words, but in swirling constellations of light that shift and stutter as you stare. The air hums with a low, electric frequency, and the answers—when they appear at all—glow in colors that don’t exist in any spectrum you’ve ever seen: cobalt fire, violet silence, the shimmer of a dream just before waking.

Your pencil floats off the desk and hovers above the paper, as if drawn by an unseen magnet. When you pick it up, the tip begins to write itself—not your hand, but something beneath it, something ancient. The answers form rapidly: equations of emotion, philosophical riddles in ink that smells like rain on stone, and a single sentence that repeats in every question, in every language, in every voice in your memory: *“You already know this.”*

But the clock on the wall isn’t ticking. It’s breathing. Slow, deep breaths. And as time stretches, the room around you begins to dissolve—into a library made of roots, a city built into the sky, a child’s laughter echoing from a door that leads nowhere.

You glance down and realize the exam paper isn’t paper at all—it’s a living thing, its edges fraying like skin, whispering your name in a voice that’s half yours, half someone you knew before you were born.

And then, just as you reach for the next question, you wake.

Still breathing. Still in bed. The clock shows 3:17 a.m.

Your hands tremble.

And somewhere, deep in the quiet of the night, you realize: you *did* answer it.  

And the dream already passed.
