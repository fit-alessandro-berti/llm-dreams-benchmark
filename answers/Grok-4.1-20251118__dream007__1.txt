…decide to shut them up the only way that makes sense in dreams: by suddenly growing to the size of a skyscraper.

One moment I’m eye-to-eye with them in their cramped living-room, the next my head is punching through the ceiling like it’s made of tissue paper. Plaster rains down. Their voice shrinks to this tiny, tinny squeak far below as I rise up through the roof and stand in the street, cars swerving around my ankles.

I look down (way, way down) and there they are, a little action-figure version of my friend, still yelling up at me, red-faced, fists clenched. Their words are just faint, angry chirps now, like a furious sparrow.

And instead of feeling triumphant, this horrible guilt floods in. Because even though I’m enormous, I can still see the hurt in their microscopic eyes. The argument suddenly feels so stupid, so small. I crouch, slowly, carefully, trying not to crush the neighborhood, and lower my face until it fills their entire sky.

“I’m sorry,” I whisper, and the words come out as a warm wind that flattens trees for three blocks.

They stop yelling. For a second we just stare at each other (me, a colossus; them, an ant with my best friend’s face). Then they reach out and put one tiny hand on the tip of my giant nose.

The world tilts. The city folds in on itself like paper. Suddenly we’re both normal-sized again, sitting on the living-room floor surrounded by broken drywall and moonlight. They’re crying a little. So am I. Neither of us remembers what we were fighting about.

We hug. The dream starts to fade, but just before it does, they murmur into my shoulder:

“Next time, just use your words, you absolute kaiju disaster.”

And then I wake up laughing, reaching for my phone to text them:  
hey. coffee? my treat. no growing involved, promise.
