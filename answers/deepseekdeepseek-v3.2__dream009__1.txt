You wake in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find a way back, or at least understand where—or when—you are.**

The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth. The buildings are timber and wattle, thatched roofs sagging with age. People pass by in rough-spun tunics, their faces smudged with soot or soil. No wires, no engines, no glass panes—only the creak of carts and the cluck of hens in the muddy lane.

Your heart hammers, but a strange calm settles over you. *Observation first*, you think. *Panic later.*

You approach a woman drawing water from a well. “Excuse me,” you say. She stares at your clothing—your synthetic jacket, your zippered pants—as if you’ve descended from the moon. Her reply is in a tongue that sounds almost like English, but the vowels are round and strange, the consonants softened. You catch only fragments: “…from the south?…King’s men…?”

You nod uncertainly and move on, keeping to the edge of the village. At the tree line, you find a low stone marker, moss-choked, with letters carved deep: **ANNO DOMINI 1347**.

The year catches in your throat. *1347*. Just before the Black Death would sweep through places like this. You feel the weight of history, not as a chapter in a book, but as the very ground beneath your feet.

That’s when you realize what you truly need. It isn’t just shelter, or food, or even the language.

**You need to survive the timeline itself.**

And perhaps, you think as you watch the sun sink behind the wooded hills, you need to decide whether “getting back” is even the right goal—or if you were sent here for a reason no dream has yet revealed.
