wake up in a bustling medieval village, the air thick with the scent of wood smoke and fresh bread. The sun is just beginning to rise over the thatched rooftops, casting long shadows on the cobblestone streets. You stand at the edge of a marketplace, where villagers are already setting up stalls—carpenters hammering away, blacksmiths tending to their forges, and women arranging baskets of vegetables and cheeses.

As you wander through the narrow streets, you realize you have no money, no identification, and no knowledge of the local language or customs. Your clothes, though clean, are clearly out of place—modern, unadorned, and lacking the traditional garb of the time. People glance at you curiously, but you can sense suspicion in their eyes. 

You know you need to find a way to survive in this unfamiliar world. Food, shelter, and safety are immediate concerns, but beyond that, you must figure out how to adapt to this new reality. You decide to start by finding someone who might be willing to help you—a kind-hearted villager, perhaps a priest or healer, or even a merchant who seems more open-minded.

As you walk, you pass a small inn with a sign swinging above the door. Inside, you catch a glimpse of people gathered around a fire, sharing stories and food. It feels like a safe place to start, so you push open the door and step inside, hoping to blend in and learn more about your new home.

But as you sit down at an empty table, you realize you have no coin to pay for anything. The innkeeper, a burly man with a weathered face, approaches you with a wary look. You try to explain your situation, but the words come out in a strange, broken dialect that only confuses him further.

He points to the door, indicating you should leave. But before you can get up, a young woman with bright eyes and a warm smile steps forward. She speaks in a language you understand, though it’s not exactly your own—it’s a mix of the local tongue and something familiar. She introduces herself as Elara, a traveler herself, who has spent years learning the ways of the village.

Elara offers to take you under her wing, teaching you the basics of survival: how to barter, how to speak the local dialect, and how to earn your keep. In return, she asks for your help with a task—she needs someone to assist her in gathering herbs for a nearby apothecary. It’s a simple enough job, but it requires you to venture into the surrounding forest, where danger lurks in the form of wild animals and bandits.

With Elara by your side, you set off into the woods, the morning sun filtering through the trees. As you walk, she tells you stories of the village, its history, and the challenges it faces. You begin to feel a sense of purpose, knowing that you’re not entirely alone in this strange new world.

But as you approach the forest’s edge, you hear a distant cry—a sound that sends a chill down your spine. It’s the call of something ancient, something that doesn’t belong in this time. You exchange a worried glance with Elara, who nods knowingly. She pulls out a small, intricately carved dagger from her belt, holding it tightly in her hand.

"Stay close," she whispers. "We’re not the only ones who’ve found this place."
