**Continuation of the Dream**

...start to panic, feeling a wave of anxiety wash over me as I glance around at the sea of unfamiliar skyscrapers, neon lights, and bustling streets. Every face in the crowd seems to hurry with a sense of purpose, except mine. I try to recall any details about the meeting—time, location, even the purpose—but my mind is a complete blank. All I remember is the urgency and importance attached to it.

I reach into my pocket to grab my phone for any clues, but it's not there. Instead, I find a crumpled piece of paper with a cryptic message: "Eclipse Tower, 3rd Eye Cafe, Wear the Mask." No phone, no watch, just the paper and the fading light of day indicating time is slipping away.

Without hesitation, I approach a passerby, a woman with a kind face, and show her the paper. "Excuse me, can you tell me where Eclipse Tower is? And what's the 3rd Eye Cafe?" I ask, trying to sound calmer than I feel.

As I approach Eclipse Tower, its silhouette against the twilight sky is imposing, with lights flickering to life like a thousand fireflies. I rush in, dashing through the lobby towards the elevators. The display above the elevator reads "22" as the doors open, inviting me in. 

Upon arriving at the 22nd floor, I push open the door to the 3rd Eye Cafe, and a bell above the entrance chimes softly. The cafe is dimly lit, with tables empty save for one in the corner, where a figure sits with their back to me. On the table, facing me, is a mask—it gleams with an ethereal light, as if waiting.
