Wake up in a mist-shrouded morning, the scent of pine and woodsmoke heavy in the air. Sunlight filters through rough-hewn timber frames, casting long shadows across cobbled streets in a village where time seems to move in steady, slow rhythms. You’re wearing a woolen tunic and trousers—clothes of practicality, worn but clean—mingling with the musty warmth of early 19th-century life. A gentle pause: no hum of engines, no flickering screens, only the slow cadence of horse hooves and distant church bells.

As you step into the village square, you notice curious glances—locals speaking in dialects old and measured, their hands moving deliberately as they mend fences, load wooden carts, or tend to simples stalls dripping with fresh bread, dried herbs, and forged tools. The air buzzes with quiet human exchange: barter, storytelling, laughter shared over mugs of spiced cider.

You realize—you need to find shelter, but not just any shelter: a place where knowledge waits and practical skill is passed like a torch. A small, unassuming workshop catches your eye: tools laid out methodically, a spinning wheel nearby, handwoven cloth on a loom. Above, faded oil paintings flicker in dim light—old maps, botanical sketches, diagrams of machinery long past.  

Perhaps here, you must learn the art of craft, not by sight alone but through hand and patient hours. To survive here, you must adapt—trade might for survival, listen to the elders, and master forgotten rhythms. The dream deepens: in this world, your93また thread through time, not as observer, but as weaver—building connection between past and present, one learned step at a time.
