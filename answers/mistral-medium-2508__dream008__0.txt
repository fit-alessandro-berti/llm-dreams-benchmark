feel a strange mix of panic and exhilaration. The project is a glowing, shifting hologram floating above your desk—a labyrinthine blueprint of a city that doesn’t exist yet, its streets pulsing like veins, its buildings morphing like living things. Your boss’s voice echoes, but their face is blurred, their words stretching and warping: *"We need this by sunrise. Not tomorrow’s. The one in five minutes."*

You reach for your keyboard, but the keys are made of liquid mercury, slipping through your fingers. The screen flickers—suddenly, it’s not code you’re writing, but *music*. The project is a symphony, and the deadline is the moment the last note must fade. Your colleagues are all playing instruments you’ve never seen before, their hands moving in perfect, impossible sync. One turns to you and grins—a face you recognize but can’t place—and says, *"You’ve done this before. In another life."*

The walls of the office dissolve into starry void. Your desk is now a raft on a black ocean, the hologram-city floating above you like a constellation. Your boss’s voice is the wind: *"Just begin. The deadline is the point where time forgets itself."* You take a breath—and realize you don’t need to breathe here. The first note, the first line of code, the first brushstroke (because now you’re holding a paintbrush, and the canvas is the sky) *happens on its own*. You’re not creating it. You’re remembering it.

Then the alarm clock screams. You jolt awake—your real desk is cluttered with half-finished work, your actual deadline *is* impossible (but only in the normal, boring way), and for a second, you *swore* your coffee cup was still humming with the ghost of that symphony. You grab a pen, scribble one frantic line on a sticky note—*"The city breathes at 3:37 AM"*—before the dream slips away like smoke.

(How’s that? Want to tweak the vibe—more surreal, funnier, darker?)
