You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, you **begin to feel the puzzles *changing* you.**

It started subtly. The first puzzle, a rotating series of glyphs, left a faint tingling in your fingertips for hours afterward. The second, a sound-based riddle requiring perfect pitch, seemed to sharpen your hearing to an almost painful degree. Now, after navigating a chamber filled with interlocking geometric solids that demanded spatial reasoning beyond anything you’ve ever experienced, you notice something truly unsettling.

Your vision isn’t quite…normal. Colors seem richer, more vibrant, and you can perceive minute details you never could before. You glance at your hands, and the lines on your palms seem to shift and rearrange themselves, forming fleeting patterns that echo the shapes of the solids you just manipulated. 

The air hums with a low frequency, a resonance that seems to vibrate *within* your bones. It’s not unpleasant, but it’s…invasive. You feel a growing sense of detachment from your own memories, as if they’re becoming less solid, less *you*.  

Ahead, the maze walls are no longer stone, but shimmering, iridescent surfaces that ripple with light. The next puzzle isn’t a physical object, but a swirling vortex of equations and symbols hanging in the air.  A voice, not audible but *felt* directly in your mind, whispers, “To proceed, you must *become* the solution.”

Fear, cold and sharp, pierces through the growing detachment. You realize the maze isn’t just testing your intelligence, it’s…rewriting your very being. Each solved puzzle isn’t just a step forward, it’s a piece of yourself being replaced, refined, *transformed*. 

You hesitate, staring into the vortex.  Do you dare solve another puzzle, knowing it will further erode the person you once were? Or do you try to find a way *out*, even if it means abandoning the quest and risking being lost forever in the labyrinth, a fragmented echo of your former self?  

A single, perfect tear rolls down your cheek, leaving a shimmering trail that dissolves into the iridescent wall.  And then, a strange, compelling curiosity takes hold.  What *will* you become?
