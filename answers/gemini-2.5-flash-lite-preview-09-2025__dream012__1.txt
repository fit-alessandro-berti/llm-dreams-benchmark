You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you **reach for the massive, tarnished brass speaking-trumpet, its metal strangely warm against your palm, and you don't shout into it—instead, you raise it to your lips and begin to *whistle* a tune.**

It’s not a shanty, or a command. It’s a melody so clear, so impossibly pure, that it seems to cut through the roaring wind like a laser. The tune is one you haven't heard since childhood, a lullaby your grandmother used to sing.

As the notes drift out over the churning grey peaks of the waves, something miraculous begins to happen. The foam on the water stops being angry white and starts to shimmer with an internal, soft blue light. The rain, which had been slamming down like gravel, thins into enormous, slow-motion droplets that drift down like giant, perfect tears.

The wind doesn't stop; it *changes its mind*. It shifts direction, no longer trying to tear the sails, but gently guiding them. The waves don't flatten, but they lift their crests and settle them back down with a sigh, as if the sea itself is finally relaxing.

Your crew, hardened sailors whose faces are etched with fear just moments ago, lower their terrified gazes. They look not at the sea, but at you, their eyes wide with awe, perhaps even confusion. They don't understand how this is happening, but they feel the shift in the very fabric of the air.

You keep whistling, your gaze fixed on the horizon, which is no longer a menacing black line, but is beginning to bloom with an impossible color—not the rising sun, but a vibrant, deep violet that smells faintly of ozone and lilac.

When you finish the last, high, sustained note, the silence that follows is profound. The sea is now slick and polished, reflecting the violet sky perfectly. The ship bobs gently, utterly safe.

Then, from the deep, impossibly clear water directly beneath the bow, a single, colossal shape begins to rise. It is not a whale, or a kraken. It is a structure of smooth, obsidian glass, spiraling upward, covered in glowing runes that pulse in time with your fading heartbeat.

You know, with the absolute certainty of the dream state, that this structure is the true destination, and the storm was merely the necessary chaos to awaken the right kind of music. You lower the trumpet, a smile spreading across your face, and command your crew:

**"Batten down the dreams, lads. We're docking."**
