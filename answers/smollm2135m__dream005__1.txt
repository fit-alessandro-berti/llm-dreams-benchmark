The music swirl fills my senses as I enter the scene. The thumping drums and wailing guitars in the background create an eerie ambiance that makes me feel like I am right there with them rather than anywhere else. I'm not sure what kind of night it is, but I notice a few tables filled to overflowing with the collective laughter and lively chatter.

Everywhere you look, people are engaged in some form or another – dancing, singing, playing music on guitars, and more. The air seems heavy with tension, as if all this energy is causing me unease. Suddenly, I catch sight of a woman standing next to me at the back of the table, her hood swiveling slightly as she catches my attention. Her eyes seem open from the moment her hand fell off just before we made entrance, and I can tell that she's not just another person in a group – she might be someone else altogether.

Her name is Luna, and she introduces herself as a mysterious figure who comes to us seeking adventure or information, but it seems there might be more to her than meets the eye. As soon as she speaks, I feel an urge to dance – this moment has already become one of pure escapism for me, surrounded by such cacophony that my mind is flooded with the sounds of people trying to avoid each other and the feeling of unease in the crowd.
