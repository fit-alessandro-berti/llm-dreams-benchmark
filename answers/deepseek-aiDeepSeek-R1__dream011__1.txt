**Dream Completion:**

You sit at the desk, palms slick against the exam booklet, the clock’s ticking unnervingly loud. The first question glows on the page: *"What did you abandon to get here?"* Your breath hitches. The next: *"Map the crossroads where you chose fear over curiosity."* The words twist like smoke, rearranging into *"Describe the color of regret."* 

The room warps. Walls dissolve into a haze of old memories—the internship you declined, the art class you skipped, the nervous *"no"* to a love that might’ve rerouted everything. The exam paper bleeds ink, pooling into a puddle at your feet. When you reach to mop it, your hand phases through, and the questions now float in the air, voiced by people from your past: a teacher chiding *"Unprepared!"*, a friend whispering, *"What if you’d said yes?"* 

A blank page materializes. No multiple-choice, no essays—just a pen that hums in your grip. You scribble *"I don’t know,"* and the words ignite, ash spiraling into constellations. The desk melts into grass, the ceiling a starscape mirroring your uncertainty. A final question echoes, not from paper, but your ribs: *"Who will you become if you stop running?"* 

You write until the pen etches light, not ink. The answers aren’t solutions—they’re bridges. The exam hall crumbles, but the chair beneath you roots into earth, steady. When you wake, the ghost of the pen lingers in your fist, and the clock’s ticking sounds softer, slower, like it’s waiting for you to begin.
