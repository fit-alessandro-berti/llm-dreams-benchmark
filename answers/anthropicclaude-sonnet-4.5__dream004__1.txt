...as your fingers touch its surface, the canvas ripples like water. 

Colors begin bleeding through from the other side—first a deep violet that pulses with your heartbeat, then gold fractals that spiral outward in impossible geometries. You realize the canvas isn't blank at all; it's been waiting, listening to thoughts you haven't yet formed.

When you step closer, your reflection doesn't appear. Instead, you see a garden growing in reverse—flowers closing into seeds, trees shrinking into saplings, fruit leaping back onto branches. A hummingbird made entirely of crystallized sound hovers nearby, and each beat of its wings releases a different memory: the smell of rain from childhood, the taste of a word you've forgotten, the feeling of a place you've never been.

You reach out to paint something, but there's no brush. Your hand moves anyway, and where it passes, the air itself changes texture—becoming velvet, then smoke, then something like frozen music. The shapes you create don't stay where you put them. They drift off the canvas and orbit around you like curious creatures, humming questions in colors you can somehow hear.

Behind you, footsteps approach that sound like pages turning. You know without looking that whatever is coming will ask you to paint something impossible: the sound of silence, the weight of a dream, or perhaps the exact shade of the feeling you get when you remember you're remembering.

The canvas whispers: *"Show me what you've forgotten you know."*
