You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas. Intrigued, you place your hand on the canvas, which reacts by filling with a night sky and a cityscape. A figure made of stardust invites you into the painted world where you can shape reality with your thoughts. After a while, you feel a tug on your consciousness and the figure tells you that the world will always be within you. As the dream fades, you wake up in your bed, the memory of the dream still vivid and real.
