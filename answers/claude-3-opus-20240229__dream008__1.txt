...frantically search for your laptop, only to realize it's missing. Panic sets in as you rummage through your desk drawers, hoping to find it. Your boss approaches, asking for an update, and you mumble an excuse about your laptop being misplaced. As you continue your search, the office suddenly transforms into a labyrinth of endless cubicles.

You start navigating the maze-like office, trying to find your way back to your desk, but each turn leads you further into the unknown. Coworkers you've never seen before pass by, their faces blurred and distorted. You call out for help, but your voice seems to be swallowed by the eerie silence that blankets the office.

Suddenly, you find yourself standing in front of a door with your name on it. Hesitantly, you turn the knob and step inside, only to find yourself in a dimly lit room with a single desk at the center. On the desk sits your laptop, glowing invitingly. You rush towards it, eager to start working on the project, but as you reach for the device, it begins to levitate and float away from you.

You chase the laptop through the room, but it always remains just out of reach. The walls start closing in, and the air grows thick and heavy, making it difficult to breathe. Just as you feel like you're about to be crushed, you hear your boss's voice booming from above, demanding the project be completed.

In a last-ditch effort, you leap towards the laptop, finally grasping it in your hands. As soon as you touch it, the room starts spinning, and you find yourself back at your desk, laptop in front of you, and your boss nowhere to be seen. You look at the screen, only to see a message flashing: \ Deadline: Yesterday.\
