You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you hesitate—your voice seems to vanish in the noise of passing traffic and chatter. But one of them, an elderly woman with warm, crinkled eyes, gently touches your hand and says, “We were all lost once. But sometimes, being lost is how we find what we didn’t know we needed.”

They form a loose circle around you, their presence like a soft shield against the city’s chaos. One holds a map that glows faintly at the edges; another hums a melody that sounds familiar, like a lullaby from childhood. You begin to walk with them, not toward any specific destination, but simply *forward*—and with each step, the streets seem to rearrange themselves, revealing paths lined with lanterns that weren’t there before.

As you walk, the weight in your chest lightens. You start to remember fragments—your name, the reason you came to the city, a song you used to sing in the rain. The strangers exchange knowing glances, but say nothing. Then, at a crossroads where silver mist curls around lampposts, they stop.

“This is where we leave you,” says a young man with ink-stained fingers. “But you’re not alone anymore, are you?”

You look down and realize you’re holding a compass—not pointing north, but steadily rotating until its needle aligns with your heartbeat.

“No,” you whisper. “I’m not.”

And as the city softly fades into dawn, you take your first certain step toward what comes next.
