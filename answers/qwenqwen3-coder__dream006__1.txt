...begin to speak, but the words feel different somehow - lighter, more musical than usual. The audience leans forward, captivated not just by what I'm saying, but by the way the words seem to shimmer in the air between us.

I realize I'm speaking about dreams themselves - how they connect us, how they reveal the hidden landscapes of our minds. As I talk, the theater walls seem to dissolve, and I can see that the audience is no longer just sitting in rows, but floating gently above their seats, their faces peaceful and open.

The speech flows effortlessly now, each sentence building on the last like waves. I'm telling them about the bridge between sleeping and waking, about how in dreams we're all citizens of the same impossible country. The crowd nods as one, understanding something they've always known but never quite remembered.

As I reach the final words, the stage lights begin to fade, but instead of darkness, the space fills with a warm, golden glow. The audience doesn't applaud - they simply smile, as if we've all just shared the most natural thing in the world.

And then I wake up, smiling myself, trying to hold onto that feeling of connection and the strange, luminous quality of the words that seemed to write themselves.

What would you like to happen next in this dream?
