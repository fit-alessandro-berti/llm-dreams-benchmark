...find a way to explain myself. I awoke to the smell of woodsmoke and the sound of someone painstakingly hammering metal in the distance. Sunlight, a weaker, softer light than I remembered, filtered through a haze that hung thick in the air. I sat up, heart pounding, from a pile of what seemed to be hay. It was then that I realised – this wasn't hay. It was straw, damp and scratchy, of a quality I hadn't seen since I'd last wielded it myself as a child.

Had I *fallen* into a Renaissance Faire?  I shook off the daze, swatting at a loose strand of the same scratchy, prop-like straw that, curiously, hadn't changed under my weathered hand. No, this is no ordinary straw. This is dry, brittle hay piled high on a makeshift platform for... yes, it *is* hay. My mind reeled. Hay as far as I could see, woven between stalls of leatherwork and smelled beadwork. The pleasant confusion I'd felt in the initial blooming of my consciousness vanishes. Panic claws at me. My clothes – I'm wearing a roughspun tunic and doublet – are all wrong. My phone isn’t in my pocket.

The hammering grows closer, louder, as I look around, frantically trying to make sense of everything. A medieval village stretches out around me, bustling with activity. I'm no longer in sterile, brightly lit alarm studios. I'm surrounded by tents and wood carts, the air alive with the sounds of laughter, singing, and the occasional clucking rooster.

There’s a crowd gathered around a gliding duo – a knight and his beautifully-dressed squire – the metallic tang of their swords unwelcomely sharp in the air. They are the stars of the festival today, the calliper, a visitor from the nearby castle&#8217^s code. Maybe I can swipe a castle-code from the vendor’s satchel! I reassure myself when the knight, noticing my bewildered gaze, gestures Elaborate stage prop stalls loaded with colourful flags, valiant armour, artisans   polish with smiles like a glimpse of the future had wrapped an arm around their shoulders, like they’re in a dance.

**...blend into the crowd, find a way to explain why I'm in the midst of this bustling fantasy market. I've got to think of something clever. I mean, who strands at a castle fair in a doublet? Where did I even get the idea?**

Suddenly, a vendor with wild hair and a leather apron winked at me, his smile filled with mischief. He wore a straw hat cocked at just the right angle, and around his neck hung a small, handhacked toy soldier carved from a strangely-pleasant, white wooden block, and fiercely sharpened metal tools were used for nearly everything and are worn by me –**

The dream shifted, pulled out of its indulgence in gouda cheese and hissing ale, pulling me back to the present.

**These tools** needed to be useful and beautiful to begin with, I reminded myself, cutting through my own poorly-made, cheesy attempt at a j^us**tif My name is Bard, and I remember now, this stitch-by-stitch, delicate work. This was my craft.
