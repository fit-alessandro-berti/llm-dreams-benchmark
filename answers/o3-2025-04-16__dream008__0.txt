…feel your pulse spike. The fluorescent lights over your cubicle begin to hum louder than usual, strobing like a heartbeat. When you glance at the wall clock its hands are spinning so fast they blur into a silver halo.  

Your boss—now inexplicably ten‑feet tall and wearing a suit stitched from spreadsheets—leans down. His neck stretches like taffy.  
“Well? Get started,” he says, each word echoing as if spoken inside a parking garage.

You sit, open your laptop, and discover the keyboard has melted into liquid letters. Each key is a floating tile of the alphabet bobbing in mercury. You try to type but vowels slide through your fingers, consonants sink out of sight.  

Panicked, you search your desk for a pen, but the drawers have become drawers of actual draws: tiny artist’s easels, each holding an unfinished sketch of a clock showing a different, equally terrifying deadline. The sketches animate, their minute hands ticking toward zero.

The room tilts. Cubicle walls fold into one another like collapsing dominoes, revealing an endless open‑plan floor that stretches to a horizon lined with copier machines exhaling clouds of paper snow. Colleagues glide by on wheeled office chairs, chanting project milestones in Gregorian harmony:

“Phase one yesterday,  
Phase two yesterday,  
Phase three yesterday…”

Their voices form a wind that lifts you from your chair. As you hover, you notice every coworker’s face is your own, aged forward or backward by decades. One version of you—grey‑haired and serene—catches your eye and mouths: “Remember you’re dreaming.”

Lucidity flicks on like a desk lamp. The chaos pauses, frozen mid‑flutter: papers hang in mid‑air, spinning keyboards become still ponds of ink. You inhale, and time inhales with you; the spinning wall clock slows until its hands touch twelve and stop.

“Impossible deadline?” you mutter. “Let’s try impossible solution.”

You clap once. The mercury letters on your desk surge upward, rearranging themselves into a shimmering 3‑D blueprint of the entire project: tasks, dependencies, risks, all orbiting you like satellites. With a gentle push you send the model soaring toward the towering boss. It fractures into a million origami cranes that land on his colossal shoulders and begin typing, stapling, coding on his behalf.

The boss shrinks back to normal size, suit transforming into a comfortable cardigan. He smiles, suddenly kindly, and offers a mug that reads WORLD’S OKAYEST DEADLINE. Steam rises; it smells of Saturday mornings and no alarm clocks.

The office lights dim to the amber of a sunset. Cubicles blossom into bamboo gardens, copier clouds drift away as lazy cumulus, and a skylight opens to reveal constellations shaped like paperclips and coffee cups. You ride an updraft through the ceiling, cranes escorting you in a gentle spiral.

Far below, the spreadsheet cardigan waves. The deadline, now written across the sky, dissolves into stars, each pop sounding like a bubble of laughter.

Weightless and calm, you close your eyes inside the dream and feel yourself drift toward waking, certain of one thing: the real day ahead will never be as impossible as the one you just conquered in your sleep.
