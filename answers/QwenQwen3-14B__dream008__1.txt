You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you—  

—notice the clock on the wall has stopped, its hands frozen at 3:07 a.m. Your boss, usually a stern figure in a tailored suit, now wears a tuxedo made of melting ice, their face half-obscured by a foggy mirror. They hand you a folder labeled *“Project: Infinity.”* Inside is a single sheet of paper with one sentence: *“Build a bridge between the first breath of dawn and the last sigh of night. Deliver it by tomorrow.”*  

You stare, paralyzed. Your coworkers vanish, leaving only the hum of fluorescent lights and the faint sound of a distant, distorted lullaby. Your keyboard morphs into a piano; your screen flickers with equations that rewrite themselves every time you blink. You try to ask your boss for clarification, but their voice echoes like wind through a canyon: *“You always knew the deadline was impossible. Now prove it isn’t.”*  

Panicked, you sprint to your desk, only to find your computer replaced by a chessboard. Each piece is a miniature version of your colleagues, frozen mid-motion. You realize the project isn’t a task—it’s a riddle, a test of reality itself. You spend hours (or minutes, or centuries) rearranging the pieces, trying to force logic into the chaos.  

Then, a breakthrough: You knock over the chessboard, scattering the figures. The room dissolves into a desert of glass shards, each fragment reflecting a different version of yourself—some laughing, some screaming, some already dead. You kneel, pick up a shard, and see your boss standing atop a dune, their ice-tuxedo now a flowing robe of starlight. They smile, and the desert collapses into a single, glowing thread of light.  

You grab the thread, tie it into a knot, and present it to your boss. They nod, and the impossible deadline vanishes. But as you exhale, you notice your hands are now made of smoke, and the office walls are slowly turning to sand. You wake up—still at your desk—but your coffee is cold, and there’s a tiny bridge made of spaghetti on your keyboard.
