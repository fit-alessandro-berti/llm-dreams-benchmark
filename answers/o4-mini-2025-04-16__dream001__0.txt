You start to walk, your shoes clicking on a sidewalk that ripples beneath each step like water. Streetlights pulse in time with your heartbeat, casting long, wavering shadows. Every corner you turn seems to rearrange itself: shopfronts melt into mirrors, lampposts bend into archways, and neon signs flicker words you almost recognize—“This Way,” “Trust Me,” “Hurry.”

Your pocket buzzes. You pull out a phone that wasn’t there a moment ago. The screen shows a map splattered in ink, routes branching chaotically in dozens of directions. There’s a single blinking dot labeled “Meeting.” You tap it. The map ripples, then reveals only a single line leading down an alley.

You slip into the alley. The walls close in until you’re in a narrow tunnel of graffiti and broken glass. A shadow flickers at the far end—someone holds out a folded piece of paper. You reach for it and unfold a hand-drawn floor plan of a building you’ve never seen, corridors looping impossibly, staircases that go nowhere and everywhere at once.

Time is slipping away. You sprint back into the open street. City traffic parts as if moved by an unseen hand: yellow taxis hover inches above the road, cyclists pedal backwards toward you, pedestrians stare with blank, knowing eyes. You pass a tower made of glass bubbles, each reflecting a different version of yourself—some confident, some lost, some asleep.

Panting, you check your watch. Thirty minutes left. You glance up: the sticky sky is turning violet and green, clouds sliding sideways. You notice a soaring rooftop garden above you, vines trailing down like welcoming arms. The vines form a living ladder. Without thinking, you grasp one and climb.

Reaching the top, you find a courtyard lit by lanterns shaped like oversized lilies. A single door stands at its center, painted the color of twilight. You step inside—and find yourself in a vast conference hall. Rows of seats stretch into darkness; at the front, a lectern bathed in soft light.

Your heart hammers. The doors at the back close with a gentle click. You walk down the aisle, every footstep echoing. On the lectern rests your own reflection in a polished nameplate. You read your name, and beneath it: “Welcome.”

The audience is empty, yet you feel dozens of gazes. You swallow, approach the lectern—and realize this meeting isn’t with others at all but with yourself. The hourglass on the podium flips itself over. Sand begins to fall. You take a deep breath, straighten your shoulders, and begin to speak—though the words have yet to form, you know this is where you were always meant to be.
