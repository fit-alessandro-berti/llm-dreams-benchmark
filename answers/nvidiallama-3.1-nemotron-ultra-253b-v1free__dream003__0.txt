...symbols etched into the lid, shimmering with a soft, ethereal glow. The patterns seem to shift and swirl before your eyes, like the surface of a serene lake disturbed by a gentle breeze. As you reach out to touch the box, the glow intensifies, and the air around you grows thick with an otherworldly energy.

Suddenly, the symbols begin to rearrange themselves, forming a cryptic message that pulses with a soft, blue light:

"When shadows fall, the key is born,
In reflection's heart, the path is sworn.
Seek the truth where darkness reigns,
And claim the key that unlocks the box's ancient pains."

As the message fades, the box emits a low, humming noise, and the lid begins to rise, just a fraction of an inch. You peer inside, but the darkness within seems to defy the light around you, making it impossible to discern what lies beyond the threshold.

You look around, taking in your surroundings. You find yourself in a vast, moonlit garden, with towering trees that seem to stretch up to the sky like giant sentinels. A meandering path, overgrown with vines and moss, disappears into the shadows. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the distant, melancholic call of a nightingale.

You notice a few objects that catch your attention:

1. A small, ornate **mirror** hanging from a nearby branch, its surface cloudy and opaque.
2. A **lantern** lying on the ground, its wick smoldering, casting flickering shadows on the trees.
3. A **stone pedestal** in the distance, upon which rests a small, leather-bound **book**.

Which object do you approach first?

**Please respond with the number of your chosen object.**
