…grip the wheel tightly, feeling the salt spray sting your face as the waves roar like living giants around you. The ship groans against the pressure, but you know it has weathered many trials before. Lanterns swing wildly, casting fractured light across the deck where your crew waits, their eyes wide but trusting.  

You inhale deeply, and with that breath comes clarity. You raise your voice above the howl of the storm—not with panic, but with a steady command. The sails are adjusted, ropes secured, and every sailor moves with renewed purpose.  

The sea tests your resolve, surging higher, thrashing against the hull, but within the storm there is also a rhythm, a hidden current calling you onward. It doesn’t feel like a battle to win, but a passage to endure—a portal leading somewhere new.  

As the ship crests a massive wave, for a moment, everything stills. Lightning flashes, illuminating not chaos but a distant glow beyond the horizon—a shimmering line where storm and sky part, beckoning you forward. And in that glow, you feel as though the sea itself is guiding you, carrying both ship and soul toward a destination unknown, yet deeply familiar.
