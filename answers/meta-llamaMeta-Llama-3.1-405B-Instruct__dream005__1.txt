I pass by a group of flappers dancing the Charleston, their beads and fringe flapping wildly as they spin to the music of a live jazz band. Next to them, a cluster of medieval knights in armor are engaged in a heated debate about the merits of jousting.

I continue to scan the room, and my eyes land on a group of futuristic-looking individuals sipping neon-colored cocktails and chatting about the latest advancements in intergalactic travel.
