As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are not written on a paper, but painted on the very surface of the air itself.

The blue-grey sheet of the clerk’s desk dissolves into mist, and faint, luminous glyphs rise from your fingertips, forming sentences in the wind. They curve like vines around the lampshade and drift downwards, turning into a stream of silver ink that splashes into your lap.

“Describe the colour of ambition,” one of the questions asks, in a voice that comes from the opposite wall, a tune that feels like the first promise of sunrise. A soft, golden light blooms around your shoulders, and your reflection in the pane of glass morphs into a young child holding a small white square.

Another above the corner, shimmering in copper, blinks: “Which of these paths do you hear?” By your left are three luminous archways, each casting a different hue: the blue one made of marble bricks, the green of wild forests, and the red of bright fire-lit streets of neon. Each arch whispers a different song—one of measured steps, one of winding roots, and one of adrenaline.

When your pen touches the first word, the ink slides like water over the page, swirling in a slow, deliberate dance. The question dissolves into a door. Hurtling forward, a sharp silver comb appears, growing an impossible feather cage before your eyes; above it, a tiny, glimmering star punctures your mind’s hall from which one might choose the correct reply.

You feel your breath fog as you stare at the quill of sketched script that gnaws at your barked rebellions and negatives until it clears with a sunny light. When you finally read the answer, you see your past—a teenage girl in her backyard using a stone quader to stare at the sky. A quiet dream lying beyond the city, according because your choice demands, you find yourself rootly banging the the brick open in that erased guilt.

A thunderous crack sorts the template of your future with fraying argument, and somewhere deep inside, you hear the tap, the cheat out the hidden curtain reveals, the answer you want has become the one truth: a responsibility of fate.

As you rise from that desk the whole panoramic thing collapses into flat spirals and the writing dims; it slides out of the paper leaves like a stone carving into a silent ghost of wisdom. The dream ends with the last question that applies to the future: 

“What is your future?” and now your fingers seamlessly reach out and paint the answer in a glowing comet of fierce ambition and realize that your path glows bright and unbreakable. The exam has passed and you open the door.
