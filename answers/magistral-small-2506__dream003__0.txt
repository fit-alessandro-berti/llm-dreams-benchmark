**The Dream Continues...**

You run your fingers over the intricate patterns on the box, tracing swirls and symbols that seem to shift slightly under your touch. A faint, rhythmic pulse hums beneath the metal—almost like a heartbeat. The air around you grows heavy, charged with something unseen.

Then, a whisper cuts through the silence: *"Only what you’ve lost can unlock what you seek."*

You freeze. The words make no sense—yet they feel *important*. Glancing back at the box, you notice a small, hidden groove along one edge. It resembles the shape of a handprint, but not quite human. The symbols around it resemble a language you almost recognize—one from a half-remembered childhood dream.

Your reflection in the polished surface of the box distorts. For a split second, it isn’t *you* staring back, but someone—or something—else. A pair of glowing eyes blink at you before the illusion fades.

Heart pounding, you press your palm against the groove. The box shudders, and the patterns begin to peel away like layers of skin, revealing a gaping darkness inside. A voice, layered with many others, murmurs:

*"Step through. The key is the end of what you hide from."*

The dream shifts—you’re falling, but there’s no fear, only curiosity. The box, the whisper, the shifting symbols—it all dissolves into a swirl of colors, and you wake with the taste of metal on your tongue and a single, final thought:

*It wasn’t a box. It was a lock.*

And you were the key all along.
