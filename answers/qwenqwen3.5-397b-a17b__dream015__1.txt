...cultivate a single patch of earth, not for food, but for beauty.

You clear the ash from a small crater near the skeleton of a rusted skyscraper. Your hands, wrapped in frayed cloth, tremble not from fear, but from the sheer weight of the absurdity. In a world starving for calories, you are choosing to starve for color.

You dig until your trowel hits something soft. Not dirt, but memory. From your pocket, you produce a seed you found in the lining of a coat that didn't exist yesterday. It pulses with a faint, warm light. You place it in the ground and pour your last ration of water over the dust.

In the fluid logic of the dream, time accelerates. A green shoot spirals upward instantly, unfurling leaves that look like stained glass. A bud forms, swells, and bursts into a flower that hums with a low, resonant frequency. The sound vibrates through the ruins, shaking dust from the bones of the old world. Responding to the song, other flowers sprout nearby, glowing softly against the encroaching twilight.

The choking gray sky above shifts to a bruised purple, then a soft, dawn pink. You realize then that the true danger wasn't the wasteland, but the resignation. As the scent of impossible jasmine fills your lungs, the edges of the world begin to blur. The ruins dissolve into mist, and you wake with the smell of soil still on your hands.
