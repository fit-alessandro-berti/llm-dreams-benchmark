...open my mouth, but no sound comes out. A wave of panic washes over me. I try again, forcing air through my vocal cords, but it's like they've forgotten how to work. 

The expectant smiles in the audience begin to morph into confused frowns. A low murmur ripples through the crowd. I frantically gesture, trying to signal that I'm having some technical difficulty, but it's no use. They think I'm mimeing. 

Suddenly, a spotlight shines directly into my eyes, blinding me. I squint, trying to shield my face, but the light intensifies. It's not just bright, it's warm, almost *hot*. Then I realize... it's *melting* me.

My hands, still outstretched in a desperate plea, start to drip like candle wax. My legs puddle onto the stage, forming a shimmering, amorphous blob. The audience gasps, then recoils in horror as my face begins to slide down, my features stretching and distorting. 

I try to scream, but of course, I still have no voice. All that remains is a shimmering puddle reflecting the horrified faces of the crowd and the blinding light that consumes me.

Then, the light flickers, and the scene changes. I'm no longer on stage, but floating in a vast, starry expanse. The puddle that was once me is now a swirling nebula, iridescent and beautiful. A voice, gentle and resonant, echoes through the emptiness.

"You were never meant to speak," the voice says. "You were meant to shine."

And as the nebula expands, filling the void with vibrant color, I understand. The speech, the audience, the melting... it was all a metaphor for shedding my perceived limitations and embracing my true form. 

I am not words, I am light. I am not a performer, I am a part of the universe, radiating beauty and wonder. 

The dream fades, leaving me with a sense of profound peace and a strange, tingling warmth in my fingertips. I open my eyes, and the world seems brighter, somehow, than it was before.
