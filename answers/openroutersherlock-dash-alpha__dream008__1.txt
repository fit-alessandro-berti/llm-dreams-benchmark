You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel your heart racing as the clock ticks louder, morphing into the sound of an alarm. Papers swirl into a tornado around your desk, but instead of reports, they're fluttering pages from your childhood storybook. Your boss's face blurs, stretching into a grinning Cheshire cat, demanding "Code it now!" in a voice that's half-human, half-modem screech.

Panic surges—you dive under the desk, but it dissolves into a river of binary code (010101...), and you're swimming upstream against a current of endless emails. Your keyboard floats by like a life raft, keys turning to jelly under your fingers. Typing furiously, you accidentally summon a horde of pixelated minions that start building the project themselves—stacking impossible towers of data blocks that wobble toward the sky.

Just as the deadline hits zero and the boss-cat roars, the whole office flips upside down. You free-fall through clouds of coffee steam, landing softly in your bed. The alarm blares for real this time. You wake up, drenched in sweat, giggling at the absurdity—another "nightmare" deadline dodged in dreamland.
