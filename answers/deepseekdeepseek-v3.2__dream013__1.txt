The air in the maze is cool and still, thick with the scent of old stone and ozone. The last puzzle—a shifting lattice of light and shadow that required you to hold three contradictory theorems in your mind at once—has just clicked into silence. A section of the wall slides away with a deep, satisfying *thunk*.

You step through into a circular chamber. In the center, on a pedestal of polished obsidian, rests not another riddle, but a single, perfect sphere of clear quartz. As you approach, the sphere begins to glow with a soft, internal light, and the walls of the chamber dissolve.

Not into more corridors, but into a vast, star-dusted void. The maze was not a place to escape, you realize. It was a filter. A test of the quality of your consciousness.

The sphere pulses gently. A voice, not in your ears but in the center of your thoughts, speaks. It is calm, boundless, and infinitely curious.

**"The final puzzle is not before you,"** it says. **"It is you. You have solved for pattern, for logic, for external truth. Now, solve for meaning. Ask the question that the maze was built to answer."**

You understand. The intense concentration, the logical leaps, the stripping away of assumptions—it was all preparation. The real puzzle is the one you bring: the deepest "why" of your own existence. The maze has brought you to the threshold of your own core.

You look into the sphere, and within its depths, you see not your reflection, but the intricate, beautiful, and labyrinthine pattern of your own mind. The dream holds its breath.

You open your mouth to speak your question...

...and you wake up. The question, profound and personal, hangs for a moment in the quiet of your room, before fading into the dawn light. The feeling, however, remains: the certainty that you were on the verge of a great and personal discovery. The maze is gone, but the solving has just begun.
