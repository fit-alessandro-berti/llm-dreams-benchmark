You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you **bellow orders over the roar of the waves**, your voice cracking like the thunder above. The deck tilts violently; ropes snap like whips, and a mast splinters, sending wood shards flying. A crewman grabs your arm, eyes wide with terror—“*The hold’s flooding!*”—but you wrench free, climbing the slick steps to the helm.  

Your first mate, a scarred woman named Veyra, shouts a warning: a towering wave, black as ink, is cresting dead ahead. You have seconds. **“*Hold fast!*”** you roar, gripping the wheel until your knuckles gleam. The ship lurches skyward, then plummets into the trough, the impact jolting bones and snapping chains belowdecks. A scream echoes—a barrel of rum has crushed a deckhand. You don’t look back.  

The compass spins wildly. You remember the old mariner’s tale: *“When the storm’s a beast, let it eat your shadow, not your soul.”* You yank the wheel hard to starboard, steering straight into the tempest’s heart. The crew protests, but you see it—the faint glint of a submerged reef, its jagged teeth waiting to gut the ship. **“TRUST ME!”** you thunder, and somehow, they do.  

The wave hits. Water swallows the deck. When it recedes, two crew are gone, and the hull groans like a dying thing. But the reef lies behind you, and the storm’s eye flickers ahead, a ghostly calm. Veyra meets your gaze, her lips tight. You nod. **“Bury the dead. Mend what’s broken.”**  

As dawn breaks, the sea exhales. The survivors work in silence, their faces etched with loss—and respect. You linger at the bow, salt on your tongue, wondering what price the ocean will demand next. Captains don’t get to grieve. Not yet.  

The dream fades, but the weight stays with you.
