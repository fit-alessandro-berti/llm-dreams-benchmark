you notice something peculiar - it's already painted with vibrant hues. Every color is mixed differently, yet beautifully blends to create an art piece that seems to reflect your own dreams. You approach the canvas but when you touch the colors, they change shapes and form into various objects from your wildest fantasies. This dreamscape is alive as creatures made of different shapes come out of the paints, playing with sounds generated by their bodies. The shapes communicate a melody that harmonizes into an enchanting symphony filling the air around you. Every time something changes on this canvas, your emotions change too, and vice versa, creating an extraordinary dialogue where emotions dictate reality making it possible for both to be intertwined in endless possibilities. The world can create anything as you wish, free from limits of time or space.

Suddenly, a figure approaches the blank canvas - "Who are you?" he asks in dreamy language, his voice blending with sounds made by living creations on the paintwork.
