As you examine the locked box more closely, you notice intricate patterns etched into the surface. The patterns seem to be a complex series of interlocking symbols and geometric shapes. You try to remember if you've seen anything like this before, but your memory is foggy.

Suddenly, you hear a soft whisper echoing through the room. The voice seems to be coming from the box itself. It says, "Greetings, traveler. I am the guardian of this box. To unlock it, you must solve my riddle."

The riddle is as follows:

"I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

You take a moment to think. The riddle is intriguing, and you feel a sense of determination. You know that solving this riddle is your key to unlocking the box.

After a few moments of deep thought, you realize the answer. You whisper the answer softly to yourself, "An echo."

The box trembles slightly, and the patterns on the surface begin to glow softly. The voice from the box responds, "Correct! The box is now unlocked for you."

With a sense of accomplishment, you reach out and open the box. Inside, you find a small, beautifully crafted pendant. The pendant is made of a shimmering material that seems to change color in the dim light. As you pick it up, you feel a surge of energy coursing through you.

Suddenly, the room around you begins to shift. The walls transform into a lush forest, and the ceiling opens up to reveal a vast sky filled with stars. You find yourself standing in a clearing, the pendant glowing brightly in your hand.

You look around and see a figure standing at the edge of the clearing. It's an old man with a kind face and wise eyes. He smiles at you and says, "Welcome, traveler. You have proven yourself worthy. Take this pendant as a symbol of your journey."

With a newfound sense of purpose, you take the pendant and continue your journey through the enchanted forest. The dream feels both magical and real, and you know that this is just the beginning of your adventure.
