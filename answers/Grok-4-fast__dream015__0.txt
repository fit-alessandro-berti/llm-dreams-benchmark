...start a garden. Not just any garden—a defiant patch of green in the cracked concrete of what used to be a bustling city square. The soil is poisoned, they say, laced with the fallout from the bombs that turned the sky to ash. But I've got seeds smuggled from a forgotten greenhouse, tiny miracles wrapped in foil, and a stubborn will that refuses to wither.

The first day, my hands blister as I claw through rubble with a rusted shovel, unearthing shards of glass and twisted metal that whisper warnings. Mutated rats skitter at the edges of my vision, their eyes glowing like embers, and in the distance, the howls of the wanderers—those hollow-eyed souls who've traded humanity for survival—echo off the skeletal skyscrapers. Water is the real killer; I ration it from a leaky canteen, each drop a gamble against dehydration. But I plant anyway: tomatoes that promise red bursts of joy, corn that could tower like sentinels, herbs to mask the rot in our meals.

By week two, sprouts pierce the earth like green fingers reaching for a sun that's half-hidden behind perpetual haze. I name them—Eden One, Hope's Root—whispering encouragements as if they can hear. Word spreads through the ruins; a scavenger with a scarred face and a child's hand in his pauses at my barricade of scrap metal. "Fool's errand," he mutters, but his eyes linger on the fragile shoots. I offer him a corner plot, and he stays, teaching me to rig rainwater traps from old billboards. Others trickle in: a mechanic with oil-blackened fingers who fashions drip irrigators from car parts, a former teacher who recites botany lessons from memory to the wide-eyed kids who trail her like ducklings.

Dangers mount as the garden grows. Raiders spot the green from their perches on crumbling overpasses, drawn like moths to our fragile light. One night, under a moon bloated with radiation, they come—silhouettes with jagged blades and desperate snarls. We fight not with guns we've long since traded for food, but with ingenuity: caltrops of rebar, snares from scavenged wire, and the mechanic's homemade flash-bangs that erupt in blinding fury. I swing a shovel like a scythe, heart pounding a rhythm older than the apocalypse—protect what you've built. We repel them, bloodied but unbroken, and in the aftermath, we plant marigolds along the perimeter, their golden petals a ward against the dark.

Months blur into a rhythm of soil and sweat. The garden swells, vines climbing chain-link fences, pumpkins swelling like forgotten dreams. We trade excess with distant camps: a handful of beans for a battery, a cucumber for stories of the world before. Laughter returns, tentative at first, bubbling up around communal fires where we roast ears of corn and swap tales of the stars we can barely see. I've lost count of the scars—on my skin, in my soul—but here, amid the thorns and the triumph, I remember what it means to create. To choose life over the void.

And then, as the dream frays at the edges, the sky cracks open—not with thunder, but with color. A rainbow arcs through the haze, impossible and vivid, washing the ruins in promise. I wake with dirt under my nails and a seed in my palm, wondering if it was all a vision... or the blueprint for tomorrow. What do you decide to do next in this dream?
