You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak—but your voice sounds distant, as though it’s echoing from underwater. The words you meant to prepare for this moment have dissolved, leaving only a jumble of syllables and half-formed ideas. You glance down at your notes, but the text is shifting, morphing into hieroglyphs, then into swirling ink that drips off the page like liquid shadow.  

The audience leans forward, their faces blurring into a single, featureless mass with a thousand mouths all murmuring in unison: *"Say something. Say something real."* Your hands tremble as you reach for the microphone, but it transforms into a long, serpentine rope that coils around your wrist. Panic surges—then, suddenly, a child’s laughter rings out.  

From the back of the hall, a small figure darts forward: a version of yourself, no older than seven, holding a glowing lantern. The crowd parts, intrigued, as the child lifts the lantern toward you. Its light spills into your chest, warm and golden, and the hieroglyphs on your notes rearrange themselves into simple, perfect sentences. You recognize them—not from preparation, but from your earliest memories: stories your grandmother told, poems you once loved, truths you’d buried.  

You speak. Your voice grows steady, resonant. The serpent-rope unravels, becoming vines that bloom across the stage into flowers that sing along with you. The audience dissolves into a field of stars, each one blinking in rhythm with your words. And as you finish, the child version of you claps, and for the first time, you realize the speech wasn’t about *impressing* anyone—it was about remembering who you’ve always been.  

The dream fades, but the flowers remain, their songs lingering in your bones.
