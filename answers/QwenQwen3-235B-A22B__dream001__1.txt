You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to **run**, but your legs feel weighted, as though wading through invisible molasses. The streets twist unnaturally—sidewalks curve into spirals, lampposts lean like drunken sentinels, and the sky pulses with a faint, greenish hue. You pull out your phone, but the screen flickers with static, then morphs into a childhood photo of yourself, grinning under a forgotten summer sky.  

A clock tower in the distance chimes, though the hands are spinning backward. **Fifty minutes left.**  

You grab a stranger in a trench coat, who dissolves into mist at your touch, leaving behind a single key. A woman with a fox’s tail tosses you a map scribbled on parchment that smells of burnt cinnamon. “Follow the shadows,” she hisses, vanishing into an alley that wasn’t there a moment ago.  

The map’s ink bleeds and reforms as you walk, directing you to a bridge suspended over a chasm of stars. Halfway across, the planks crumble, but you leap—and land not in the abyss, but in a sunlit boardroom. The table is empty except for a ticking pocket watch and a note: *“You’re early.”*  

The walls begin to melt. **Fifteen minutes left.**  

You wake up at your desk, heart racing, the meeting still an hour away. But on your calendar, the event has changed: the title now reads *“The City That Ate Time,”* and the location is simply an asterisk.
