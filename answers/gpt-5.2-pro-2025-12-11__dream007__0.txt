…step away before you say something you can’t take back.

You turn and walk out, but the door you push through isn’t the one you came in by—it’s a thin curtain of rain hanging in the air like a stage prop. The moment you pass through it, the argument’s words stop meaning anything. They don’t vanish; they turn into objects. A sharp sentence becomes a shard of glass in your hand. An accusation becomes a small, heavy stone in your pocket. Your friend’s last line—something that hurt more because it was almost true—folds itself into a paper bird and flutters after you, tapping your shoulder like it wants to be read again.

You’re suddenly in a long hallway that feels familiar the way a childhood smell does. It’s lit by buzzing fluorescent lights, but every few steps the lights change into something else: candlelight, sunrise, aquarium-blue. Doors line the walls. Each door has a label, but the labels won’t stay put. They slide around like magnets on a fridge: “Pride,” “Fear,” “Being Right,” “Being Understood,” “That One Thing We Never Talk About.”

Behind you, your friend is still talking, but their voice comes through the vents like an announcement in a train station: calm, distorted, impossible to answer. You try anyway, but when you open your mouth, a handful of sand pours out—warm and dry, slipping through your fingers. The more urgently you try to explain, the faster it spills, piling at your feet until your shoes sink.

A door marked “Apology” appears. You grab the handle, but it’s hot, like it’s been sitting in the sun. You pull your hand back and notice, for the first time, that your palms are covered in ink—blue-black, smeared, the way you look after signing too many forms. On your wrists there are tiny stamped dates, none of them real: “Next Tuesday,” “The Summer We Lost,” “Five Minutes Ago.”

Somewhere ahead, water is running.

You follow the sound and the hallway opens into an enormous indoor pool that stretches out like an ocean under a ceiling of clouds. The surface is perfectly still. Floating on it are hundreds of small boats made from notebook paper, each one covered in handwriting. You recognize your own sentences on some of them. On others, your friend’s. Some are from years ago, things you forgot you ever said. Some are blank, as if waiting for the moment you’ll fill them with something you don’t yet know how to say.

At the pool’s edge sits a lifeguard chair. In it is an older version of you—hair different, posture tired, face calm. They blow a whistle once, not loud, just enough to cut through the buzzing of your thoughts.

“No running,” they say, like it’s the only rule that ever mattered.

You look down and realize you’re holding the glass shard and the stone. The paper bird circles above you, frantic. Your friend stands across the pool now, somehow already on the other side, arms folded. They look smaller than they did in the argument. You can’t tell if that’s because you’re farther away or because the anger has drained out of the room like someone pulled a plug.

You want to shout, but you remember the sand.

Instead, you kneel and set the stone down. It lands with a soft, wrong weight, like setting down a word that’s been carried too long. You place the glass shard next to it. The shard reflects your face, but fractured into versions: you-without-defensiveness, you-without-fear, you-who-meant-well, you-who-was-wrong.

Then you reach for one of the paper boats and unfold it.

It’s a sentence you don’t remember saying, but you feel it in your bones: *I’m scared that if you don’t agree with me, you don’t love me.*

The ink on your hands begins to dissolve, washing away in invisible water, and the pool responds—ripples widening from where you kneel, gently rocking the boats. The lifeguard-you watches, expression unreadable but not unkind.

Across the water, your friend unfolds a boat too. You can’t see what it says, but their shoulders lower. They sit down at the edge, mirroring you without thinking.

A bridge rises between you—quietly, mechanically, like a theater set piece—made of nothing but the paper boats snapping together into a walkway. It looks too fragile to hold anyone, but in dreams you don’t question engineering.

You step onto it. The paper flexes under your weight, but it doesn’t tear. Each footfall makes a soft sound like turning a page.

Halfway across, the paper bird finally lands on your shoulder. It has stopped tapping. It just rests there, warm and light, as if it’s tired of being a messenger and wants to be forgiven into silence.

You reach the other side and sit beside your friend. Up close, you can see that their eyes are wet, though they’re not crying. They glance at you as if expecting you to restart the fight, to sharpen your words again.

You don’t.

You take a breath and—miraculously—no sand falls out.

“I don’t want to win,” you say, and it’s the first thing in the dream that sounds like your real voice. “I want you here.”

Your friend looks down at their hands. The stone and the glass appear in their lap too, as if the dream insists both of you carry the same weight. They set them down without ceremony.

“I don’t know how to say it without it sounding like blame,” they whisper.

“Try anyway,” you say. “And I’ll try to hear it without armor.”

For a moment, the pool’s ceiling of clouds shifts, and you see a patch of night sky through it—stars arranged like punctuation. A comet scratches a long line, like someone crossing out a sentence.

Your friend nods once, slowly, as if learning the movement. “I felt like you chose being right over… us.”

The words hurt, but they don’t cut. They land like something honest, not thrown.

You close your eyes. When you open them again, the hallway is gone, the pool is gone, the lifeguard chair is gone. You’re back where the argument began—same room, same light—but the air is different. Softer. As if the walls have stepped back to give you space.

Your friend is still in front of you. Their face holds the same history, the same affection, the same stubbornness. But their mouth is closed now, waiting.

You glance down. The ink is gone from your hands. The stone is gone from your pocket. The shard is gone from your palm. Only a single folded paper boat remains, tucked behind your ear like a childish joke.

You pull it out and open it.

Inside, in handwriting that could be yours or theirs, it says: *Say something that makes room for both of you.*

You look up, and for the first time in the whole dream, you feel the argument turning—not into victory or defeat, but into a doorway.

You decide to walk through it together.
