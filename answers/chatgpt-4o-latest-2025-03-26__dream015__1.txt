…press on, determined to find a pocket of peace in the chaos. The sky above is bruised with hues of ash and crimson, remnants of the old world lingering like faded memories. You tighten the worn strap of your backpack—inside, a few cans of food, a cracked compass, and a photograph of a smiling face you barely remember.

You walk for hours through broken cities and silent forests. Strange creatures move in the distance—twisted by whatever cataclysm reshaped the earth—but you keep your distance, guided by instinct and the flickering hope of something better.

Eventually, you come upon the ruins of an old train station, buried beneath ivy and shattered stone. The wind whistles through the broken windows, carrying with it a faint, rhythmic sound—music?

Against all odds, someone is playing a piano inside.

Drawn by the haunting melody, you step into the building. A woman sits at the rusted instrument, her fingers coaxing beauty from decay. She looks up, meets your gaze, and smiles—not with suspicion, but recognition, as if she'd been waiting for you.

She speaks softly: "You're just in time. The others are gathering. There’s something we’re building beneath this world… something new."

And in the surreal hush of that moment, you realize you’re not alone—that amidst the ruins, a dream of rebirth pulses quietly, waiting.

You step forward, ready to help shape the world anew.
