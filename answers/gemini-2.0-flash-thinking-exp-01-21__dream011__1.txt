... **written in elegant calligraphy on thick, creamy parchment.  They look official, important, almost…ancient.**  You take a deep breath, trying to calm your racing heart, and finally focus on the first question.

It reads:

**Question 1:  Describe the sound of your ambition.**

You blink.  Sound of your ambition?  What does *that* even mean? You reread the question, thinking maybe you misread it in your pre-exam jitters.  But no, it's definitely "sound of your ambition."

You glance at the other questions, your confusion growing with each one.

**Question 2: If your future career were a color, what shade would it be and why?**

**Question 3:  What is the texture of your greatest fear?**

**Question 4:  Imagine your success as a flavor. Describe it in detail.**

**Question 5:  (This question is simply a blank space with the instruction:  "Listen closely.")**

You stare at the exam paper, a cold dread creeping into your stomach.  This isn't right. This isn't the exam you studied for.  Where are the formulas, the theories, the practical applications?  This feels… personal.  Intensely, unnervingly personal.

A nervous giggle escapes your lips, quickly turning into a shaky breath.  Is this some kind of elaborate prank?  Are you in the wrong room?  But everyone around you seems to be just as confused, their brows furrowed, pens hovering hesitantly above the parchment.

You try to answer the first question, to write *something*, anything.  But how do you describe the sound of ambition? Is it a roaring engine? A quiet hum?  A crashing wave?  Your mind races, trying to grasp at something concrete, but all you find are slippery, abstract images.

The silence in the room is thick with bewilderment and a rising tide of panic.  You look around again, noticing details you hadn't before.  The room seems to have shifted slightly.  The windows are now taller, the light filtering through them casting long, strange shadows.  The air feels heavier, almost viscous.

And then, you realize, with a jolt that sends shivers down your spine, that the pen in your hand isn't a pen at all.  It's a feather quill, scratching faintly against the parchment as you try to write.

This isn't an exam.  This is something else entirely.  And the questions… the questions are somehow asking you to define yourself, not your knowledge.  A strange, unsettling feeling washes over you, a sense that you've stumbled into a dream within a dream, and the answers to these bizarre questions will determine something far more profound than just your career.  You look down at the parchment again, at the question about the sound of your ambition, and a faint, whispering sound seems to echo in the vast, silent space of your mind, as if the dream itself is waiting for your answer.
