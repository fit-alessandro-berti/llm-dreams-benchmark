…not questions at all, but blank spaces where questions should be.

Each page is a pale, humming emptiness: numbered lines, no text. At the top of the first page, in a careful serif font, it simply says:

“Final Examination: Demonstrate that you are the person you claim to be.”

There’s no professor at the front, only rows of students, all hunched over their desks, writing furiously. Somehow they’ve found something to answer. Pens rasp, pages flip. You look more closely: every other exam has questions printed clearly. Only your booklet is empty.

A slow heat crawls up the back of your neck.

You flip through all the pages. Blank. The clock above the board is wrong; its hands spin quickly, then jerk, then move backwards. Your own name is written on the cover in unfamiliar handwriting.

A soft voice behind you says, “You’re late.”

You turn. The seat is empty.

When you look back at the exam, the first line of the first page has filled itself in with a faint gray sentence:

1. Explain, in detail, why you still believe there will be instructions.

Your pen is already in your hand; you don’t remember picking it up. The ink doesn’t look like ink. It looks like something between shadow and smoke. You try to write: “Because—” but the word writhes and blurs, letters slipping out of formation. The page shudders, absorbing the attempt and leaving only a smear.

The room feels tighter. Fluorescent lights hum louder, flicker. One by one, your classmates raise their hands. Each time one finishes, they stand, walk to the front, and vanish as they cross some invisible threshold. No door opens. No sound.

You are on question 3 now, though you never saw question 2 appear.

3. List all the things you did instead of preparing for this moment.

As you read, the answer begins writing itself in tiny, cramped script across the page: every procrastinated hour, every half-finished plan, every time you said, “I’ll deal with it later.” It’s unsettlingly precise. It includes things you had forgotten, things you didn’t admit even to yourself. The list keeps going, spilling into the margins, curling up the sides of the paper.

You try to tear the page out, but it won’t rip. The paper stretches like skin.

The clock chimes, not like a school bell, but like a grandfather clock submerged underwater. You glance up. The hands now read: SOON.

A new sentence appears, centered, perfectly clear:

4. What are you actually afraid will happen if you fail?

Your heart thuds. You know this one. You think: “I won’t become who I’m supposed to be.” You think: “Everyone will see I was pretending.” You think: “There won’t be another chance.” You press the pen down to write, and this time the ink bites into the page, too dark, too real. The words push back at you as you form them, letters thick and heavy, like you are admitting them to something that has been waiting.

The overhead lights go out. No one reacts. The other students keep scratching their pens on paper you can’t see.

A glow rises from your exam booklet instead, illuminating only your desk, like a spotlight. The exam has fewer questions now. Questions 5 through 99 have vanished. There is just one final prompt, written in a hand that looks disturbingly like your own:

Final Question (100% of grade):
Without using future tense, describe the life you have chosen.

You realize the trick: not the life you hope for, plan for, promise yourself you’ll start on Monday. The life you have chosen, by your actions, by the days that already passed.

You hesitate. The glow pulses.

“I choose—” you start to write, but the pen locks. The nib hovers a hair above the page.

Another line etches itself beneath the prompt:

You may not lie.

Your pulse spikes. Images flicker at the edges of your vision: jobs you don’t want but tolerate, conversations you never had, projects unopened, the version of you that only exists in conditional clauses. You feel something towering behind your shoulder, reading with you.

You lower the pen. Slowly, you write:

“I have chosen a life where…”

The truth that follows does not feel like you are composing it. It feels like you are discovering it, already carved in the page, waiting for you to trace.

As each word lands, the exam room around you warps. One sentence: the walls dissolve into the gray of early morning bus commutes. Another sentence: the air presses with the weight of other people’s expectations. Another: your own voice, smaller than you thought.

You want to stop. But your hand keeps moving, and you keep learning what you’ve actually been choosing all along.

You finish with a period that sounds like a door closing.

Silence.

Then the page softens. The ink seeps downwards, and the answer you wrote becomes a reflection: there you are, sitting in that life. The version of you that comes from these choices: tired eyes, careful, competent, slightly dimmed. Not tragic. Not monstrous. Just not the person you have insisted you “will become someday.”

The exam speaks, though no words are printed:

THIS IS YOUR PASSING GRADE.

You flinch. “Wait. No. I can change. I didn’t know. That’s not what I meant to choose.”

The clock ticks. The hands read: NOW.

The page blanks again, except for a single handwritten note at the bottom margin, small enough you almost miss it:

Retake available only at time of awareness.

You look up.

The classroom is gone.

You are sitting upright in your bed, the last word of your plea caught in your throat.

Your heart races. The residue of the exam clings to you—the blank pages, the ink that knew too much, the final question that refused the future tense. You realize you are, uncomfortably, exactly at “time of awareness.”

On your nightstand, where your alarm clock sits, the digital display should read 3:17 AM, but for one impossible second, before it snaps back into numbers, it glows a single word:

CHOOSE.
