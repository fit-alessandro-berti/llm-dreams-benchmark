...take a step back. You realize that the intensity of the emotions is clouding your judgment, and you suggest, "Hey, let's pause this for a moment. I need some air, and I think we both need to cool down before we say something we'll regret."

The scene shifts. The room dissolves into a quiet, misty forest path. The air is cool and smells of pine and damp earth. Your friend is still there, but the tension has lifted, replaced by a shared sense of bewilderment at the sudden change of scenery. You walk together in silence for a few paces, the crunch of leaves underfoot the only sound.

"Look," your friend says softly, pointing.

You follow their gaze to a clearing ahead. In the center stands a massive, ancient tree. Its bark is silver-grey and etched with patterns that look like constellations. Instead of leaves, the tree is covered in softly glowing lanterns of all shapes and colors—some like paper, some like glass, others like captured starlight. They sway gently in a breeze you cannot feel.

As you approach, you realize the lanterns are not just hanging; they are whispering. Each one holds a memory or a feeling connected to your friendship—the time you stayed up all night talking, the time one of you helped the other through a tough moment, the time you laughed so hard you cried.

You both stand in the quiet awe of it, the argument you were having suddenly feeling very small and far away. Without a word, you reach out and gently touch one of the lanterns—a particularly bright, warm-colored one that hums with the memory of unwavering support. It brightens at your touch.

Your friend touches another—a cool blue one that glows with the quiet understanding of shared solitude. It pulses in response.

You look at each other, and in that look is the understanding that the foundation of your friendship is deeper and more complex than the single point of disagreement. You don't have to resolve the argument right now. What you need to do is nurture the light that's already there.

You wake up, the feeling of the cool forest air still on your skin, and the faint echo of a whisper in your ear: "Remember the lanterns."
