accept, feeling a sudden warmth spread through your chest that chases away the chill of isolation. You take the hand of the person nearest to you, whose skin feels surprisingly warm, like sunlight stored in stone.

As you begin to walk together, the chaotic noise of the traffic softens into a rhythmic hum, like a distant choir singing in a language you almost understand. The skyscrapers around you stop looming and begin to sway gently, like tall grass in a breeze. The strangers don't speak, yet their intentions are clear in your mind: *Follow. You are safe.*

They lead you down an alleyway that wasn't there moments before, paved with smooth river stones instead of cracked concrete. At the end of the path, there is no building, only a large, wooden door standing freely in the open air, framed by arches of blooming jasmine. They gesture for you to open it.

You turn the handle, and behind the door lies not another street, but your own childhood bedroom, bathed in the golden light of a Sunday morning. The scent of toast and coffee drifts through the frame. As you step across the threshold, you look back to thank them, but the strangers have dissolved into motes of light that float upward into the city sky. You realize then that the city wasn't a maze meant to trap you, but a map you were finally ready to read. The door clicks shut behind you, and the feeling of being lost fades completely, replaced by the gentle buzz of your alarm clock as you wake.
