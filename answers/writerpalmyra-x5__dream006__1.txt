Then, just as panic starts to rise, the lights shift, and suddenly you’re not alone. A single hand raises from the audience, holding a small, glowing notebook. It’s open to a page filled with your handwriting—words you don’t remember writing, but feel deeply true. The person offers it to you, smiling like they’ve been waiting.

And the room leans in, not judging, but listening, as if you’ve finally said the thing you’ve always needed to say.

What do you read from the page?
