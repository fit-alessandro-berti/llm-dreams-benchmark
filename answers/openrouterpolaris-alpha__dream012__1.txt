…and you grip the rail until your knuckles burn white.

Lightning claws across the sky, turning the waves into jagged mountains of glass for a split second at a time. The hull shudders as another wave slams into the starboard side. The air tastes of salt and iron and something older.

Your first mate, eyes wide, shouts above the roar, “Captain! Orders?”

You feel their fear like a living thing. And alongside it, a strange quiet in your chest, as if some part of you has been here before.

“Hands to stations!” you call, voice cutting clean through the wind. “Reef the mainsail, keep the bow into the waves! No one goes overboard tonight, you hear me?”

They scramble to obey. Ropes snap taut, canvas thrashes, boots hammer the deck. Another blast of wind tears across the sea, and for an instant you glimpse something under the water—vast and pale, rolling beneath the surface like the shadow of a sleeping god.

A wave rears up ahead, taller than your mast.

If you try to cut across it, you’ll roll. If you take it wrong, it’ll break you.

“Straight on!” you shout. “All ahead, now!”

The helmsman swears but obeys. The bow climbs—higher, higher—until the sea falls away and your ship hangs at the peak like it’s poised on the edge of the world.

Time slows.

In the frozen white glare of lightning, every droplet of spray hangs suspended around you like shattered glass. You see your crew, faces tilted up, trusting you completely. You see your own hands on the rail, steady, unshaking. You see your reflection in the brass of the compass, and for an instant you see that your eyes are not your own; they are old, fathomless, filled with stars.

The wave breaks.

You plunge down the far side with terrible speed. The ship shrieks, but holds. Water slams across the deck, knee-deep, then chest-deep, then draining away as the bow knifes through.

A cheer rises—but is strangled halfway; the sea ahead has gone utterly black. No whitecaps, no reflection of lightning—just a jagged, circular absence, a hole in the ocean, swallowing light.

The storm’s wind is no longer pushing you away from it. It’s circling, driving you toward the dark.

You know, with the unquestioning certainty that only exists in dreams: this is the heart of the storm. The place no compass points to, because it is where all directions end.

Your first mate leans close, whispering, “Captain… what is that?”

You don’t know how you know, but the name is there in your mouth: “The Maw.”

The crew waits. Someone crosses themselves. Someone else grips a charm so hard it cuts their palm.

Another lightning flash—and your ship’s figurehead turns its wooden face toward you. Cracked paint, carved eyes full of rain, suddenly animate.

“Decide,” it rasps in a voice like water in the hull. “Turn away and drift forever. Or sail through and change.”

The wheel thrums under your hands. You understand that if you turn away, the storm will never quite end. You’ll survive, but condemned to these seas, forever avoiding the dark at the center. Familiar fear. Familiar struggle.

If you go forward, you might lose everything you recognize, including who you are.

The crew looks to you.

“Captain?” the helmsman asks. “Your call.”

The dream waits.

You feel that strange quiet in your chest again. It feels, suddenly, like freedom.

“Straight into it,” you say.

Gasps. A protest. Someone falls silent mid-curse, realizing you’re serious.

“Trust me,” you say—not as an order, but as an invitation.

Your words spread along the deck like a warmth. One by one, they nod. They put their hands back on ropes, on rails, on each other’s shoulders.

You set your jaw, tighten your grip on the wheel, and aim the ship directly for the impossible black.

As the prow crosses its edge, the roar of the storm cuts out mid-thunderclap. Sound vanishes. Weight vanishes. The world folds inside out. The stars spill downward where the sea should be, and the sea rises above you like the night sky.

For a heartbeat you are ship and sea and storm and captain all at once.

You inhale—not air but light—and wake standing on your own deck in perfect calm. The sky is dawn-soft, the sea glass-smooth, your crew safe and blinking at the sudden gentleness of the world.

Above you, the sails are full with no wind you can feel. The figurehead’s wooden eyes are closed, smiling.

Your compass spins once, then settles—not on north, but on a point that’s never existed on any of your charts. You understand you’ve brought them somewhere new. That you have become someone new.

“Orders, Captain?” your first mate asks quietly.

You look out at the unknown coastline rising in the pastel distance—lush, green, edged in gold—and you find yourself smiling.

“We make a new map,” you say. “All hands. Let’s see where we’ve landed.”
