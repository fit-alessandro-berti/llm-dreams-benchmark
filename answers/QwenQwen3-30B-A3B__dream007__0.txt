You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **reach out and grab their hand, hoping to ground yourself in the moment**. But as your fingers touch theirs, the world around you dissolves into a cascade of glowing sand, and the two of you are suddenly standing atop a floating island made of shattered mirrors. Each fragment reflects a different memory—some joyful, others painful—and the air hums with the weight of unspoken words.  

Your friend’s face flickers between anger and confusion, their voice echoing strangely as they say, *“You always do this. You shut down when it matters.”* But you notice something strange: the mirrors are cracking, and the island begins to tilt. You realize, with a jolt, that this is not just a dream—it’s a manifestation of your shared history, a place where unresolved conflicts take physical form.  

Suddenly, the sand below you starts to swirl, forming a vortex that pulls at your feet. Your friend reaches for you, but you hesitate. In this dream, you’ve never been able to fix things before. Yet now, you see the truth: the island is collapsing because you’ve both been clinging to the same old wounds, refusing to let go.  

You take a breath and step forward, into the vortex. The mirrors shatter, and for a moment, everything is silent. Then, you wake up—sitting on the edge of your bed, heart racing, the echo of the argument still lingering. But this time, you remember: the dream wasn’t just a fight. It was a warning. And maybe, just maybe, it was also a chance to begin again.
