You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak—only to realize your voice has turned into the sound of a thousand fluttering doves. Their wings fill the hall with a delicate,rippling symphony, and instead of words, the audience smiles, nodding as if they hear every sentence perfectly.

You look down. Your hands are made of stained glass, refraction painting rainbows across the podium. The papers in your hand dissolve into origami cranes that spiral upward, each one carrying a single memory: your grandmother’s laugh, the smell of rain on pavement after your first heartbreak, the quiet moment you held a stranger’s hand at a funeral and didn’t let go.

The crowd doesn’t react to your silence—they *remember*. Each person in the room begins to weep gently, but not from sorrow. From recognition. They’re not listening to you. They’re hearing their own unsaid truths, echoing through the bird-song of your voice.

A child in the front row stands up. She walks to the stage, takes your glass hand, and whispers, “You don’t need to speak. We’ve been dreaming this speech all our lives.”

You wake up—not with a jolt, but with a sigh, warm and heavy, like the last note of a song you didn’t know you were humming.

On your nightstand: a single paper crane, folded with impossible precision. And on its wing, written in faint silver ink:  
*“You were the message all along.”*

You smile.  
You don’t remember what you were supposed to say.  
But now, you know why you were meant to speak.
