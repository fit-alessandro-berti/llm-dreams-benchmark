feel your heart pounding as you glance at the calendar—only **24 hours** to complete what should take weeks. The office around you blurs into a surreal haze, the fluorescent lights flickering like distant stars. Your computer screen displays an endless stream of tasks, each more daunting than the last.  

Then, something strange happens. A glowing keyboard materializes in front of you, its keys shifting between symbols you don’t recognize. Without thinking, your fingers start typing at an impossible speed, lines of code (or is it an incantation?) pouring out:  

```python
def complete_project(reality_bend=False):
    if reality_bend:
        return "Task accomplished. Time loop initiated."
    else:
        raise DeadlineError("Not enough hours in the day.")
```

Your boss leans over your shoulder, but their face keeps changing—colleague, mentor, childhood teacher—all watching expectantly. A whisper in your mind says, *"What if time isn’t the problem?"*  

Suddenly, the walls dissolve into equations:  
$$ t' = \gamma(t - vx/c^2) $$  
The deadline stretches like taffy. You wake up—or do you? The keyboard is still there, now floating above your bed, pulsing softly.  

(Do you reach for it?)
