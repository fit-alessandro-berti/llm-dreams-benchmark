As I enter the study room and begin preparing for my final exam, I am aware of countless thoughts swirling within me. Some of these thoughts include:

1. What will their feedback look like? Will they be more supportive or discouraging than usual?
2. What is it about this course that will set me apart from others in the class?
3. How can I best prepare myself to meet the expectations of my instructors?
4. What adjustments am I going to make during my preparation time, and what are the risks associated with these changes?
5. How do I ensure I stay focused during this exam without simply relying on flashcards or practice questions?
6. Who will be there that day to check my work – my instructor, peers, a review buddy, or even their parents?
7. Will they notice anything particular about me? (I wonder if I might stand out as the one person who was present that day)
8. What is the most important topic that has been covered in class recently and what will it be on the exam?
9. Can I really learn from past exams, or are those just excuses to avoid work?
10. What about this course overall – does it have its share of difficulties for students like me?
