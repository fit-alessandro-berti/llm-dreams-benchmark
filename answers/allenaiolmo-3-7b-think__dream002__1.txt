**Completion of the Dream:**  

You feel a storm’s approach as the temperature drops sharply, the sky darkening with brooding clouds. The first crack of thunder sends a shiver through the forest, and the wind howls, tearing at your clothes. Rain begins to fall in sheets, blurring the path as the ground trembles underfoot. Just as panic sets in, a bolt of lightning strikes a nearby tree, splitting it into two with a sound like glass shattering. From the split trunk, glowing vines snake across the forest floor, forming a bridge to an unseen path. Heart pounding, you step onto the glowing bridge, and as the storm rages behind you, the forest around you begins to shift—trees morphing into towering doors, each etched with symbols that pulse with the storm’s energy. You realize this is a gateway, and with a deep breath, you step through…  

The other side opens into a realm where time flows sideways, skies rotate like broken wheels, and rivers of liquid starlight carve through landscapes that defy geometry. The storm’s chaos lingers in your mind, but now it feels like a key. Behind you, the forest door closes, leaving only the echo of thunder and the faint scent of ozone. You are no longer just walking through a forest—you’re *becoming* the storm.
