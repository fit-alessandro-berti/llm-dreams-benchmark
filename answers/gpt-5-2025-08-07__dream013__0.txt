…you begin to notice that each solution costs you something small. A whisper in your ear goes quiet. The taste of a word you’ve always liked fades to the back of your tongue. A tune you were humming when you entered becomes unfamiliar. You step carefully anyway, because the floor tiles of the next room flicker between numbers and letters, and you can feel the answer vibrating in your calves.

In the first chamber you counted red tiles and avoided prime numbers. In the second you listened to a wall tell you three truths and a lie and pretended you knew which was which. Now the corridor is narrow and lined with mirrors, each reflecting the corridor at an angle that shouldn’t be possible. The puzzles have stopped apologizing for being impossible; they simply are. A sign says Speak the word that opens. Your mouth fills with silence. When you try to force a word out, the mirrors cloud as if embarrassed for you. It’s only when you exhale the way you do when you finally put down a heavy bag—almost a sigh—that the sign, satisfied, slides aside and the door yields.

You keep moving, hand skimming a wall that feels like cool paper. Dust clings to your fingertips. In your palm it looks like ground-up numbers. You rub it together experimentally and the corridor lengthens by three paces. Realizing this rule, you turn, rub backward, shorten the hall. The maze is not a place; it’s a language with a grammar you’re learning by ear. When you think this, the ceiling lowers in approval.

In another room an hourglass hangs from the ceiling, but the sand only falls when your eyes are closed. The riddle on the door reads: Make time pass without looking. You laugh, because you have been practicing that your whole life. You close your eyes and listen. The sand’s hiss is like distant rain, like your breath. When you open your eyes, the glass is empty. The door unlatches, but a single grain of sand clings to the narrow waist—stubborn, luminous. You wait. It does not move. You could blow on it, tap the glass, but you don’t. You bow instead, ridiculous and sincere, to a grain of sand, and that small respect is what the maze wanted. The last grain falls.

The deeper you go the more the puzzles stop asking about numbers and start asking about you. One hall has three doors: Always, Never, and Sometimes. The walls whisper what you told someone once after midnight, the fill-in-the-blank promises you gave to yourself and broke without ceremony. The solution dawns, and you take the door labeled Sometimes because it is the only honest one. The other two dissolve with the sound of paper tearing.

A chamber waits that smells like a classroom you recognize. Chalkboard green, chalk dust hanging in air that isn’t moving. Half-erased equations. A child’s poem in the margin, your own handwriting. The puzzle is a simple one, written in thick white lines: Name yourself. Your throat tightens, because there are so many names you’ve answered to. You pick up the chalk, write a name you no longer use, and the room shakes its head gently. You try your full name, the version people say when they’re angry or proud. The chalk breaks. Finally you put the chalk down and touch the smooth board with your hand. My name is whoever is touching this board, you say. The door opens, and you feel the memory of your first day at that school slide away like a coin dropping in water. You let it go. There is grief, small and precise, the size of a pebble in your shoe.

By degrees the maze stops resisting you. Either you are better at it, or you have become more like it. You find a passage with no lights and realize the rule here is trust your hands. You walk with your palms reading the walls, and the walls ripple under your fingers like the backs of sleeping animals. In another place, stairs go up and down at once, and the notes at each landing are written by someone whose handwriting looks like yours but tilted a little, as if written with the other hand. Some say Go back, others say Be bold, and one says Stop making sense and listen. You obey the last note. In the hush that follows, you hear a heartbeat that is not yours, but is also not not yours. You follow it.

At the center there is no center. There is a small round room with a table in it and on the table a folded map. The map shows the maze from above, except it keeps drawing new corridors as you watch, ink crawling like ivy. The key in the corner explains the symbols, but the key keeps revising itself, demoting what was important five minutes ago. The map asks you a question: What is the one route that can never be drawn? You recognize the shape of the question from old paradoxes, slippery and self-eating. You want to argue with the paper, but you are tired of arguing. You fold the map along a crease the map didn’t know it had and the walls of the round room unfold in sympathy, laying themselves flat into a spiral.

You step into that spiral. As you walk, you feel the things you left behind waiting for you—not to be reclaimed, but to be acknowledged. A tune returns at the edge of hearing, altered. A forgotten word returns with a different meaning. The hall opens onto a door without a latch, only a single instruction printed on wood: Open. You try your hand. It doesn’t move. You try logic, leverage, pleading. Nothing. You remember the sign that asked for a word and the hourglass that fell when you weren’t looking, the respect bowed to a grain of sand, the choice of sometimes. You don’t ask the door to do anything. You open, instead. Something in you unfastens—a thought you’ve gripped like a handle, a conclusion you’ve been carrying like a packed suitcase. Your shoulders drop. The door swings inward.

On the other side is not exit but sky, a good blue that could belong to late afternoon or early morning. The maze ends where you decide to stop walking it. You stand in the doorway a moment, not crossing, feeling the interesting ache of having nearly solved something that refuses to be solved. The wind brings you the smell of rain you haven’t seen yet. You think you will remember this, the way the puzzles taught you a soft kind of attention, the way solutions sometimes look like surrender and sometimes like precision. You step through.

You wake with the faint taste of chalk, sure of nothing except that you’ve left a door open somewhere inside you, and that the maze, pleased, will be waiting when you next close your eyes.
