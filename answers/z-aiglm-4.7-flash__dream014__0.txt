...and you feel a sudden, overwhelming sense of relief as you nod and accept. The strangers—dressed in coats of varying, vibrant colors that seem to shimmer in the city lights—guide you. As you walk, the chaotic noise of the taxi horns and jackhammers morphs into a rhythmic, comforting beat, and the towering skyscrapers soften into tall, welcoming trees.

They don't lead you to a specific address; instead, they simply walk beside you, pointing out the magic in the mundane—the way the rain looked like scattered diamonds, or the way the streetlights synchronized like a breath held in unison. Reaching a small, hidden courtyard bathed in golden sunset light, they smile and fade away, leaving you alone in that quiet, glowing space. In that moment, you realize that even in a place so vast, you never really were lost—only waiting to be seen.
