You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to **panic, your heart hammering against your ribs like a trapped bird. The street is a canyon of glass and steel, impossibly tall, reflecting a sky that seems both too bright and unnaturally grey. You check your phone – dead. A flicker of despair, then you remember a crumpled piece of paper in your pocket: the address. You pull it out, your fingers trembling, but the ink bleeds like watercolor in the damp air, the numbers swirling into illegible smudges before your eyes.**  

You look around wildly, asking passersby for directions. They wear identical grey suits, their faces featureless like smooth stone, and they point silently in conflicting directions before dissolving into the shifting crowd. You start running, your feet pounding on pavement that feels spongy, unstable, like running on wet sand. Alleyways yawn open unexpectedly, leading to dead ends filled with whispering trash cans or crumbling into nothingness over bottomless chasms.  

Suddenly, a parade materializes out of thin air – marching bands playing dissonant melodies, floats shaped like giant, ticking clocks. You try to shove through, but the crowd parts like smoke, reforming instantly. Glancing at a towering digital billboard, you see the time: 9:15 AM. The meeting is at 10:00 AM. A desperate thought strikes you: *Find the tallest building. The meeting must be up there.* You spot a chrome skyscraper spiraling into the low-hanging clouds and sprint towards it.  

The revolving doors move impossibly fast, threatening to slice you in two. You manage to dive through, landing hard on a marble floor that stretches into infinity. The lobby is empty, save for a single receptionist behind a desk miles away. You run towards her, shouting, but the distance never shrinks. You look back; the doors are gone. Your breath comes in ragged gasps. Glancing at your wrist, you see you aren’t wearing a watch, but the skin there glows faintly, showing the time: 9:47 AM.  

You spot an elevator with doors like polished obsidian. They slide open silently just as you reach them. There are no buttons inside, only a vague sense of ascending. The numbers flash chaotically: 13... 7... 42... Floor: ∞. A bell dings, the doors open onto a rooftop garden bathed in soft, violet moonlight, despite the grey sky outside. A figure in a flowing white robe stands near a giant, ancient oak tree, holding a steaming teacup.  

"You're late," they say, their voice echoing like wind chimes. "The meeting was in the *past*. But tea? It’s Chamomile. Helps with the..." They gesture vaguely towards the city below, which now seems to ripple like water under the moonlight. You feel the overwhelming urge to explain the ink, the faceless crowd, the distance, but the words dissolve on your tongue like sugar cubes. You sip the tea. It tastes like forgetting. Just as you realize you’ve missed everything, the rooftop gives way, and you’re falling slowly, gently, through layers of starlit dust towards... a bicycle parked neatly on a cobblestone street. You grab the handlebars, and instinctively know if you pedal fast enough, you’ll arrive exactly on time at *The Place*, a building utterly familiar yet forever nameless.
