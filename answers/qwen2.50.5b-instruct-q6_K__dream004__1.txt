Oh no! Here's a rough idea for your dream:

```
The Dream Begins
Your fingers dance over the surface of a luminous, shimmering sheet of fabric. Suddenly, an image begins to form within you, vivid and intricate. The painting is vibrant, yet somehow tinged with melancholy colors - orange, brown, pink, and purple.
You look down at the ink on your fingers—some are black, some white—but they glow a deep, rich red.
With each movement of your hand, the fabric glitters like gold dust in the moonlight. 
The painting begins to blend into an overwhelming, swirling mass of hues - rose, lavender, chartreuse, and lemon yellow intertwines.
You feel the world around you change color, from a gentle sky blue that filters sunlight through trees and roofs to a harsh, overcast cerulean that casts shadows and highlights objects far below. 
You gaze out the window wide-eyed, unsure of what colors will emerge next.

Your dream then spirals into a contemplative state as your reflection in the canvas begins to change color—soft orange on one side, then crimson across your entire body.
