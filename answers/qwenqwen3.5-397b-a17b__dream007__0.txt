you decide to **reach out and grab their hand to make them stop.**

But the moment your skin touches theirs, their hand turns to cold glass. The shouting doesn't cease, but it distorts, slowing down until it sounds like a cello string being bowed underwater. You look down and realize the floor is no longer wood, but a surface of dark, still water. Your reflection stares back up at you, but it isn't wearing your clothes; it's wearing your friend's.

The room begins to peel away like wet wallpaper, revealing a forest of towering clocks behind the walls. The pendulums swing in time with your friend's breathing, which is now the only sound in the world. They aren't angry anymore. They are holding a lantern, and inside the lantern is the argument itself—a small, stormy cloud crackling with tiny thunder.

"You're holding it too tight," they say, but their voice comes from the lantern, not their mouth.

You try to let go of their hand, but you are fused to it. The glass begins to crack. You realize the disagreement wasn't about the topic at all; it was about who was holding the light. As the glass shatters, the storm cloud escapes, turning into a flock of black birds that fly up into the clock trees. The weight vanishes. You float upward, lighter than air, watching your friend shrink below you until they look like a toy soldier.

You wake up with the sensation of falling still in your stomach, and the distinct taste of ash on your tongue.
