...feel a cold dread seep into your stomach. You glance at the clock on the wall, and its hands are spinning wildly, blurring into a smudge, then suddenly it freezes at 11:59:59 PM, yet the sun is streaming in through the window as if it's midday.

Your boss, who was just a moment ago standing directly beside your desk, is now at the end of a long, impossibly silent hallway that wasn't there before. He isn't moving, just staring, his eyes like two dark, bottomless wells, unblinking.

You try to grab your keyboard, but your fingers feel like they're made of lead, heavy and unresponsive. The monitor flickers to life, not with your usual desktop, but with a single, glaring, flashing word: **"BEGIN."** You try to speak, to ask for clarification, but your voice is gone, replaced by a faint, metallic clicking sound that seems to echo from the very walls themselves.

The project brief on your desk begins to dissolve, the words turning into swirling black smoke that rises and forms into indecipherable symbols above your head. The office walls start to undulate, breathing slowly in and out, and the fluorescent lights hum louder and louder, until the sound is physically vibrating in your teeth.

You attempt to stand, but your chair has rooted itself to the floor, its legs growing into gnarled, wooden tendrils that wrap around your ankles, holding you fast. The impossible deadline isn't just a time constraint anymore; it's a physical weight pressing down on your chest, crushing the air from your lungs. Your boss is still there, at the end of the impossibly long hallway, but now he seems impossibly *far away*, a shrinking pinpoint of dark, and simultaneously, his face is impossibly *close*, filling your vision, distorted and silent, a terrifying, expectant mask.

Panic claws at your throat. You know, with a dream's chilling certainty, that you *must* complete this project, but every movement is molasses, every thought scattered like dust. The impossible task isn't just about work; it's about escaping this collapsing reality, but the more you try to move, the more anchored you become, until the only thing left is the overwhelming hum of the lights and the silent, unblinking stare of your boss, waiting, waiting, waiting...
