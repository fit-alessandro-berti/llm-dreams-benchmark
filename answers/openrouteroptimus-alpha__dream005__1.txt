you notice that their conversations are strange and fragmented, as if you’ve wandered into the middle of countless stories at once. In one corner, a group is arguing softly about the color of the sky. In another, laughter bubbles up over a table covered in mismatched dinnerware—plates seem to appear and disappear when you’re not looking.  

You try to catch someone’s eye to ask if they’ve seen your friend, but everyone you approach always turns away just before you speak. You move through the crowd, the faces shifting in and out of focus, until you spot a flash of familiar clothing—a red scarf that your friend always wears.

You push through the crowd and call their name, but your voice makes no sound. The person with the scarf turns, but it’s someone else entirely. They smile and hold out a glass to you. When you take it, you realize your hands are transparent, and the contents of the glass ripple through your fingers like smoke.

Suddenly, music swells around you, and the floor beneath your feet gently gives way, turning liquid, pulling you toward the center of the room, where a spotlight flickers on. All eyes are on you now, and you sense your friend close by, just out of sight. The crowd’s faces blur, swirling into a kaleidoscope, and you realize that everyone at the gathering is, in some way, waiting for you to say something.
