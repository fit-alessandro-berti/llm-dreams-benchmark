…grip the soaked railing, feeling the ship shudder beneath your boots. Lightning fractures the sky, illuminating the terrified faces of your crew. You raise your voice above the roaring wind.

“Hold fast! Bring her about thirty degrees to starboard!”

Your first mate hesitates. “Captain, the waves—”

“Trust me!” you shout.

The helmsman turns the wheel, and the vessel groans as it pivots, climbing the side of a towering wave. For a moment, the ship hangs suspended on the crest, the world balancing on the edge of silence.

Then, as if guided by an unseen hand, the storm parts just enough to reveal a faint glow on the horizon—a pale, moving shimmer like moonlight dancing on calm water.

Your crew stares. “Captain… what is that?”

You don’t know, but something inside you does. It feels like a memory you never lived.

“It’s our way through,” you say, though you’re not sure why.

The glow widens into a path of still, silver water stretching forward—a corridor of calm carved through chaos. The ship slides toward it, and as you pass into the light, the storm’s roar fades to a distant whisper.

Your crew exhales in disbelief. You look ahead, and the shimmering path twists gently, leading somewhere beyond the horizon.

“Where are we headed, Captain?” someone asks.

You feel the answer before the words reach your tongue.

“Somewhere we’re meant to be.”
