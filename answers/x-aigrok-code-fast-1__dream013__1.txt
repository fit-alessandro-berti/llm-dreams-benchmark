... encounter increasingly surreal challenges. The walls shift like living shadows, whispering riddles in forgotten languages. Each puzzle solved reveals a new layer to your mind—doors that aren't doors, mirrors that reflect alternate selves, and locks that demand not keys, but the sacrifice of a cherished memory. As the maze twists inward, the air thickens with the scent of enigma, and you realize: the walls aren't confining you; they're built from pieces of unsolved dreams, waiting to collapse under the weight of insight.

And you? You smile, for the maze is not a prison—it's a mirror, sharpening your gaze on the infinite corridors of possibility. What now, wanderer? Do you solve, or does the maze solve you?
