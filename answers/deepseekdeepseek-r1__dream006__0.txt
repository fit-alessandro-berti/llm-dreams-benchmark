As you step onto the stage, the weight of countless eyes presses against you, a sea of anticipation rippling through the air. You clear your throat, and the first words tumble out—hesitant, then steadying. Suddenly, the room shimmers. Your voice takes on a physical form: golden letters materialize above the crowd, each syllable crystallizing into glowing symbols that hover like fireflies. The audience gasps as the words morph into vivid shapes—a flickering dove, a stormcloud, a cascade of ember-lit keys—all dancing to the rhythm of your speech. 

But the symbols grow bolder, swelling beyond your control. The dove fractures into a flock of paper cranes, the stormcloud crackles with unintended truths, and the keys clatter into a dissonant symphony. The crowd leans forward, not in judgment but in collective awe, their faces now reflecting the kaleidoscope of light. Panic rises—*What if I can’t rein this in?*—until you catch your own reflection in a floating shard of word-glass. 

*This is a dream.* 

The realization anchors you. You inhale, and with deliberate calm, you whisper, “Balance.” The chaos stills. The symbols melt into a river of liquid light, weaving around the audience, connecting them in a luminous web. When you utter your final word—“Awake”—the stage dissolves into a soft, sunlit haze, leaving you with the echo of a question: *What worlds might we shape when words are not just spoken, but felt?* 

Then, the curtain of sleep lifts, and you rise, breathless and grinning, the power of your voice still humming in your bones.
