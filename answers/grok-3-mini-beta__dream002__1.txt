You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the once-gentle breeze turns into a howling wind that whips through the trees, bending their branches like fragile fingers reaching for safety. Dark clouds boil overhead, swallowing the sunlight in an instant, and rain begins to fall in heavy, icy sheets that soak through your clothes and chill you to the bone. Thunder rumbles like the growl of some ancient beast awakening beneath the earth, and lightning flashes in jagged streaks, illuminating the forest in eerie, flickering glimpses.

As the storm intensifies, the path ahead twists and warps, the ground softening into a muddy quagmire that pulls at your feet. Strange shapes emerge from the shadows—trees that seem to whisper your name, their leaves rustling with urgent secrets, and animals with glowing eyes that watch you from the underbrush, unmoving and unblinking. You try to run, but the wind pushes back, as if the storm itself is alive and toying with you. In a surreal twist, the rain transforms into a shimmering cascade of colors, painting the world in vibrant hues that defy logic, and for a moment, you feel a strange sense of peace amid the chaos.

Just as the storm reaches its peak, a hidden clearing appears, bathed in an otherworldly glow. You step into it, and the winds die down, the rain fades to a gentle mist. In the center stands a massive, ancient oak, its roots glowing softly. As you approach, the dream begins to fade, the forest dissolving into fragments of light. You wake up in your bed, heart pounding, wondering if the storm was a warning or just a fleeting whisper from your subconscious.
