…and you realize you have no idea what the project is.

Everyone else in the office seems to know. They’re typing furiously, screens glowing with graphs and code and documents that somehow look finished already. Your monitor is the only one that’s black. When you move the mouse, instead of icons and folders, a single blinking cursor appears in the middle of a white, empty screen.

Your boss leans over your shoulder. You can’t see their face—just a shirt, a tie, hands clasped behind their back.

“We’re all waiting on you,” they say, but their voice is coming from the ceiling speakers, from under your desk, from your own throat all at once. “It’s due in… three minutes.”

A huge digital clock flickers into existence on the wall: **00:03:00**.

Tick.

You try to ask, “What is the project?” but when you open your mouth, a stack of sticky notes falls out instead. Each one has a different word on it:

“urgent” — “now” — “late” — “again?” — “hurry” — “faster”

They scatter across your keyboard, your lap, the floor.

No one helps you pick them up. No one even looks.

The clock says **00:02:34**.

Your fingers hover above the keyboard. The keys have changed — they’re not letters anymore, just tiny little labels: “SHOULD,” “MUST,” “FAIL,” “MORE,” “NOT ENOUGH.” When you press one, it makes a hollow sound, like knocking on a door that no one answers.

You try to stand up, to go find someone who can explain the assignment, but your chair has quietly grown seatbelts. Not the normal kind—these are office supplies: tangled ethernet cables, measuring tapes, power cords. They loop around your waist and your chest and your arms, winding tighter the more you struggle.

The clock says **00:01:58**.

Your boss’s hand appears on your shoulder. Heavy. Warm.

“Just do your best,” they murmur in that everywhere-voice. “But it has to be perfect.”

Your vision blurs for a moment. When it clears, your desk has become impossibly long, stretching into the distance like a conveyor belt. On it, a line of tasks glides past: emails, spreadsheets, presentations, half-written documents, all marked with red stamps that say “OVERDUE” and “YOU FORGOT” and “REMEMBER THIS?”

You try to grab one task to look more closely, but as soon as you touch it, the paper doubles, then doubles again, multiplying like a glitching photocopier. Suddenly your entire desk is a pile of paper, leaning, sliding, collapsing toward you in a silent avalanche.

The clock says **00:01:12**.

The office lights flicker and dim. In the sudden shadow, the hum of computers turns into whispering. You can’t make out words, but you know they’re about you.

Not fast enough.
Can’t keep up.
They’re going to notice.

The screen in front of you flashes. Text appears on it by itself:

> DEFINE PROJECT:

The cursor blinks.

You finally manage to speak, and this time no sticky notes fall out. Your voice is small but clear:

“I don’t know what the project is.”

The moment you say it, the entire office goes silent, like someone hit mute on the world.

Your boss steps around to face you.

For the first time, you try to look at their face, but it keeps shifting: sometimes it’s your boss, sometimes a teacher you had years ago, sometimes a parent, sometimes it’s you. The features flicker and swap like faces in a badly buffering video.

“What do you mean,” the shifting face asks, “you don’t know?”

You swallow. “No one told me. You just said it was due. You never said what it *is*.”

The clock on the wall jumps.

It no longer says **00:00-something**.

It just says:

> LATE

The word pulses gently, like a heartbeat.

There’s a long, strange pause.

Your boss—you—whoever that face is—tilts their head.

“So,” they ask, “if no one told you, what have you been trying to finish all this time?”

You look down at your hands. They’re still resting on the keyboard, on all those keys that say “SHOULD” and “MUST” and “NOT ENOUGH.”

You realize you’ve been typing nonsense this whole time, trying to meet a deadline for something you never actually saw.

The whispering in the office changes tone, softening, stretching out. It’s still unintelligible, but it no longer sounds like criticism. More like… wind in a hallway.

The conveyor belt of tasks disappears. Your desk shrinks back to its normal size. The messy piles of paper fold themselves into paper cranes and flutter away, perching on light fixtures and monitors, on people’s shoulders. No one else seems to notice them.

Your monitor clears again. New text appears:

> IF THIS IS A DREAM, YOU CAN CHANGE THE RULES.

The cursor blinks. Waiting.

You glance up at the clock. The word “LATE” has turned into:

> WHEN YOU’RE READY

Your boss’s hand lifts from your shoulder. The cables and cords binding you to the chair loosen and fall away, snaking back into the floor as if they were never there.

You take a breath that feels like it starts at your toes and ends somewhere above your head.

“Okay,” you say slowly, testing the shape of the idea, “if I can change the rules… then the project isn’t impossible.”

The fluorescent lights warm into something more like late afternoon sunlight. The cubicles around you stretch taller, then shorter, then melt into open space—your workplace slowly rearranging itself into something softer. The harsh edges of desks round off. The hum of the air conditioner becomes waves on a beach, or distant traffic, or maybe just your own breathing.

“What *is* the project, then?” your boss asks. Their voice is quieter now, closer to your own.

You look at the blank screen.

You know the answer before you realize you’re thinking it.

“The project,” you say, “is deciding what actually matters… and only doing that.”

The words on the monitor rearrange themselves:

> PROJECT: DECIDE WHAT MATTERS
> DEADLINE: NONE
> STATUS: IN PROGRESS

All the other screens in the office go dark, one by one, until only yours is lit. People stand up from their desks, but instead of glaring or rushing or checking watches, they just… fade, like they were drawn in chalk and someone wiped the board.

You’re alone in the office now.

You stand up easily—no cables, no cords, no seatbelts. When you look back at your desk, it’s empty except for a single sticky note.

You pick it up.

It says:

> YOU’RE ALLOWED TO REST.

For a heartbeat, you expect the clock to scream at you, for alarms to go off, for your boss to reappear with another “urgent” project.

Nothing happens.

Instead, the office door at the far end of the room swings open on its own. Beyond it, there’s no hallway, no elevators—just a calm, wide sky and a faint sense of fresh air, like standing near an open window after rain.

You step toward it.

As you do, the sticky note in your hand warms and glows softly, as if lit from within. The letters rearrange themselves one last time:

> YOU’RE ALLOWED TO WAKE UP.

You reach the doorway.

And somewhere between one breath and the next, you start to notice things: the feel of your actual bed, the distant sound of something in your real life—a car, a heater, someone walking in another room.

The office, the clock, the boss, the impossible project… all of it becomes thin, like tissue paper held up to the light.

You take another step.

And you wake up.
