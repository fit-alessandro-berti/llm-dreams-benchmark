You begin to speak—only to realize, with growing panic, that your voice has turned into the sound of distant, hollow wind chimes. The words *almost* form, but they shimmer and fade before reaching the audience. You try again, clearing your throat—now your fingers are made of translucent glass, and they *tinkle* softly against each other.  

The crowd hasn’t noticed yet. They still smile, nodding along, as if waiting for a profound metaphor to unfold. But the clock on the stage wall begins to run *backward*, and the stage floor softens like warm wax beneath your feet. One foot sinks in up to the ankle. You look down and see your reflection in the floor—not your face, but a map of constellations, shifting, rearranging into shapes you almost recognize.  

Then, from the front row, a child raises their hand. You lean closer—because, strangely, you *can* hear them. Their voice is clear and bright as a struck tuning fork:  
> “It’s okay. You don’t have to speak *words*. Just… *breathe*.”  

And with that, the wind chimes in your throat soften. You close your eyes. Breathe in—  
—and the air smells like rain on warm stone.  
Breathe out—  
—and the wax beneath your feet solidifies into smooth, cool obsidian, reflecting the constellations in perfect symmetry.  

When you open your eyes, the audience is gone.  
You’re standing on a floating island, suspended in a twilight sky, with paper boats drifting lazily in the air like silver fish.  

And then you remember:  
This isn’t a speech.  
It’s a *invitation*.  
To land softly. To listen. To begin again—not with words, but with wonder.  

You smile.  
The island trembles—not with fear, but with anticipation—  
—and you take one gentle step forward into the open sky, knowing you will not fall.  

*(The dream ends as your stomach drops—not from falling, but from laughter.)*
