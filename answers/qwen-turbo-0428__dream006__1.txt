You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak. But as your voice fills the room, something strange happens — your words come out in a language you don’t recognize. The audience nods as if they understand, their faces calm and attentive. You try to switch to your native tongue, but no sound comes out. Panic rises in your chest, but then you notice something even more bizarre: the people in the crowd are not just listening — they are mirroring your movements, as if they are part of you.

Suddenly, the stage dissolves into a vast, endless hallway, and you’re walking down it, your own footsteps echoing behind you. Each door you pass opens briefly, revealing fragments of your life — childhood memories, unspoken regrets, moments you wish you could change. You reach the end of the hall, where a single door stands ajar. Inside, you find yourself standing in front of a mirror, but when you look into it, you see not your reflection, but a version of yourself that is older, wiser, and smiling.

They speak without moving their lips: “You are ready.” The dream shifts again, and you wake up, heart racing, with the lingering feeling that you’ve just glimpsed something important — something you were meant to remember.
