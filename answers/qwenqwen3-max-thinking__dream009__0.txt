...find a way to communicate. The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth, and the low morning sun filters through thatched roofs. You’re standing in a muddy village lane, barefoot, wearing rough-spun wool that itches your skin. Chickens peck at the ground nearby, and a distant cow lows.

People move about—men in tunics, women in long skirts and head coverings—but none speak a language you recognize. Their words are guttural, rhythmic, alien. Panic flutters in your chest. No phone. No map. No way to explain who you are or where you came from.

You spot a woman drawing water from a well. She notices you staring and eyes you warily—but not unkindly. You point to yourself and say your name slowly. She tilts her head, then gestures to herself: “Elswyth.” Her voice is warm, like honey over stone.

You mimic her name. She smiles faintly. Then you mime hunger—rubbing your stomach—and she nods, beckoning you toward her cottage. Inside, the hearth crackles, and the scent of stewed roots fills the air. She offers you a wooden bowl.

That’s when you realize: survival isn’t about finding a way back—not yet. It’s about building trust, one gesture at a time. You need to learn their ways, their words, their rhythms. Only then might you uncover how you got here… or whether you were meant to stay.

And as you eat, warmth spreading through you, you notice the strange tattoo on your forearm—one you don’t remember getting. It glows faintly in the firelight, shaped like an old rune you’ve never seen before… but somehow know.
