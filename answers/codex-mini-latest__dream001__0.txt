…panic. Your heart beats like a jackhammer against your ribs as you scan the street for any clue—an address scrawled on a neon sign, a building name, even a stranger whose badge might read “Conference Center.” But the city stretches on and on: impossibly long boulevards crisscrossed by skybridges, towers of glass that shimmer like liquid dreams, alleys lit by humming lanterns that pulse in time with your pulse. You take a deep, shuddering breath.

You start to run.

Your shoes click against polished stone pavements. You burst through an arched gateway inscribed with curling, unfamiliar characters that glow turquoise. A flock of paper birds—folded cranes, swans, phoenixes—drifts overhead, folding and unfolding their wings as if murmuring secrets you almost understand. They guide you down a stairwell that spirals downward into a corridor of fog. Somewhere above you, the city’s pulse hums in distant bass.

At the bottom, you emerge into a cavernous hall. A gigantic clock dominates the far wall: twelve hands rotate in every direction, each one ticking to its own tempo. You realize each hand might represent an hour in some other time zone, or perhaps a different possibility—a choice you could make, a path you might follow. You press your palm to its smooth surface. The clock’s hands shudder, and for a moment they align, pointing due north. A hidden door slides open at the base of the wall.

Stepping through, you plunge into a labyrinth of corridors lined with doors of every shape and hue. Some doors are carved like laughing masks; others are sleek panels that glow softly when you approach. You try the first: it swings open onto a room filled with mirrors, each mirror reflecting versions of yourself at different ages—child you, teenage you, a wizened future you smiling serenely. You take a trembling step inside, but an echoing voice whispers, “Not yet—your time hasn’t come.” The mirror-world dissolves, and you’re spat back out into the hallway.

You move on. The next door you touch is a bright orchid color; it creaks open into a sunlit courtyard bursting with strange blossoms that hum melodies. A fountain of whispered words sprays letters into the air—sentences swirling around you in golden script before vanishing. You try to read them, but your vision blurs. You feel a tug at your sleeve and whirl around to see a small girl in a polka-dot dress pointing beyond the courtyard gate. “This way,” she says, though her lips barely move. Before you can ask who she is, she melds into the hedges.

Driven by instinct, you follow the path she indicated, and it leads you back up to the city streets—only now the architecture has subtly shifted. The buildings here curve in on themselves like ribbons, and a stately old clocktower ticks steadily above. You glance at your watch: thirty-five minutes until your meeting. You’ve lost half an hour in the dream-dream of corridors and courtyards.

But now you notice a single street sign, etched in embossed brass: “Conference Plaza.” Relief surges through you. You dash forward, weaving past dream-cabs whose drivers are cats in fedoras, past vendors selling glowing fruit that tastes of forgotten memories, past a fountain shaped like an open book. Finally you stand before a grand plaza, its center dominated by a ring of stone pillars that curve upward like fingers reaching for the sky. At the very heart sits a solitary marble bench, and on that bench… a single envelope addressed to you.

You tear it open. Inside, a single line: “Your meeting begins when you believe in it.” The city goes silent. All the clocks stop. The paper birds spiral down and alight on your shoulders, their weight impossibly light. In that suspended moment, you realize the meeting isn’t somewhere you have to find—it’s here, now, in the dreaming city you’ve helped create simply by seeking it.

You fold your arms and settle onto the marble bench. As you do, the pillars around you glow, casting a soft warm light. The city exhales, an entire metropolis of hope and possibility breathing with you. You close your eyes. The meeting begins.
