You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people—some laughing loudly, others murmuring in low tones, and a few standing in silent clusters. You glance around, your pulse quickening, but the crowd is a labyrinth of faces, none of whom seem familiar.  

The first group is a cluster of strangers sharing a tray of snacks, their laughter sharp and unyielding. You strain to catch their words, but they’re lost in their own hum. You try to mimic their tone, but the rhythm feels foreign.  

Next, a group of people in muted suits and polished shoes parade past, their movements deliberate. You watch them walk, noting the way their shoulders tilt, the way they adjust their cuffs. You think maybe they’re the person, but their gaze is too sharp, their eyes too steady. You follow them, but they vanish into the throng, leaving you stranded in the middle of the crowd.  

You turn to the group that has already formed a circle, their bodies leaning close, voices weaving a melody you can’t decipher. You try to join, but the rhythm is too fast, too loud. You feel the weight of the moment—this is the only way, this is the only place—yet you’re not sure if it’s the right one.  

Then, the person walks up, unnoticed. Their shoes are polished, their smile faint, their presence a ghost in the living room of the crowd. You feel the ache of longing, the weight of a life spent seeking something that never quite came into focus. You step forward, not to greet them, but to let them go.  

The dream ends not with resolution, but with the quiet weight of absence. You are still here, in the middle of the crowd, watching the people you know—until you realize, perhaps, that the real person is not in the crowd, but in the space between you and the world.
