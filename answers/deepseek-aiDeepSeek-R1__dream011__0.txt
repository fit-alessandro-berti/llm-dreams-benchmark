**Dream Continuation:**

…written in a language that shifts and swirls before your eyes, morphing from symbols you half-recognize into riddles only your subconscious could conjure. The first question asks, *“How does the taste of your childhood fears compare to the color of tomorrow?”* Panic rises as you flip through pages—every problem is a surreal paradox. *“Calculate the weight of a shadow.”* *“Diagram the anatomy of a memory.”* 

The clock on the wall accelerates, its ticking warping into laughter. Around you, classmates scribble furiously, their faces blurring into featureless smudges. The classroom walls dissolve into a vast, starless sky, and your desk floats unmoored. A voice—your professor’s? Your own?—echoes, *“The answer is always in the question you refuse to ask.”* 

Suddenly, the exam becomes a mirror. Each question reflects fragments of your life: missed chances, whispered doubts, moments of courage you’d forgotten. You pick up the pen, and it transforms into a key. When you press it to the paper, the pages dissolve, leaving only one sentence glowing in the dark: *“Your future is not a test—it’s a story you rewrite every day.”* 

You wake, heart racing, but with an unshakable calm. The dream lingers like a compass in your bones.
