As I enter this fantastical land of ever-shifting hues and forms, a stark reality beckons to break away from these transformations:
I will not stay here,
This is the realm with edges blurred,
Where colors transform every moment.
Seeking balance and equilibrium,
I must depart this ceaseless flow.

Now, how may I assist you in navigating this new world?
