…written in ink that shifts and swirls like liquid mercury, rearranging itself into different shapes whenever you blink.  

The first question reads:  
**"What is the color of a sound that has never been heard?"**  

You reach for your pen—only to find your fingers have turned translucent, your veins glowing faintly gold. The desk beneath you hums with a low, resonant frequency, vibrating in time with your heartbeat.  

A whisper brushes your ear—not from the examiner at the front, but from the blank space behind you:  
*"The answer only exists if you believe it changes the question."*  

You glance up. The other students are not human. Some are half-formed sketches, others shimmer like heat haze. One wears a suit made entirely of folded origami cranes that flutter when they shift in their seat.  

The clock on the wall has no hands—only a slowly spiraling galaxy.  
Time is not linear here.  
It is recursive.  

You take a breath.  
And realize…  
You’re not taking the exam.  
*You’re the one writing the questions.*  

The ink on the page hardens into a single sentence:  
**"Begin."**  

But where do you begin—when the exam *is* the path, and the path *is* the choice?  

*(The dream deepens. You dip your finger into the mercury script… and the page ripples open like a door.)*
