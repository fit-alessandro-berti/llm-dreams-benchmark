written in a language you've never seen before. The letters shimmer and shift on the page, rearranging themselves like they’re alive. Panic grips your chest, but when you glance around the room, the other students seem calm, placidly scribbling away with glowing pens.

Just as you consider raising your hand to ask for help, your pen begins to write on its own. Characters form on your exam paper, translating the questions as if guided by an invisible hand. The first question reads:

**"Describe the shape of silence between two thoughts."**

Your pulse slows, and something deep inside you knows the answer—not from study, but from memory, dream, instinct. You close your eyes and let your hand move.

When you open them again, you're no longer in the exam room. You're standing on the edge of a cliff, the stars above flickering in perfect silence. Below, a vast library pulses with light. A voice speaks behind you—it’s your younger self, holding the test paper.

"You passed," they say, smiling. "Now… what will you choose to become?"

You step forward into the abyss, ready to find out.
