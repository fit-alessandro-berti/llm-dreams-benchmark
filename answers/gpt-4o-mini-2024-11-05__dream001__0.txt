wander through the bustling streets, the towering buildings casting long shadows over you. The city feels surreal, almost like a place you've seen in dreams but never in waking life. Pedestrians rush past, and the hum of conversation mixes with the distant sound of traffic. You check your phone, but the map application is unresponsive, and there’s no signal.

With no clear direction, you begin to ask people for help. Each person you approach either doesn’t understand your question or gives you cryptic answers. One woman points toward a large clock tower in the distance, saying, “The time will guide you,” but it only confuses you further.

You continue walking, your footsteps echoing in the empty streets, unsure whether you’re moving closer to your meeting or further away. The city seems to stretch on endlessly, its buildings twisting and shifting as you look away, creating a sense of disorientation.

Eventually, you come across an old bookstore tucked away in an alley. The sign reads, “Knowledge beyond the horizon.” Feeling a strange pull, you step inside. The scent of old paper and wood fills the air, and rows upon rows of books stretch in every direction. In the back of the store, an elderly man sits at a desk, his eyes twinkling as he looks up at you.

“I’ve been expecting you,” he says with a calm smile. “You’re looking for your meeting, aren’t you?”

You nod, feeling both relieved and more uncertain than ever. He gestures to a nearby shelf, where a book titled “The Path You Seek” rests. “Everything you need to know is here,” he says cryptically.

With the clock ticking, you reach for the book, wondering if it will reveal the way to your meeting or lead you deeper into the mysteries of this strange, dreamlike city.
