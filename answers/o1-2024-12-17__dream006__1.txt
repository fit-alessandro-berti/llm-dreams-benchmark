…speak, but the words don’t come easily. Your mouth feels full of something heavy and unfamiliar. You pause, trying to swallow. The crowd waits, silent, each face distinct—former classmates, distant relatives, historical figures in old-fashioned attire, even a few childhood pets perched calmly on chairs. The hush presses against your ears. You try again, clearing your throat. This time, when you open your mouth, the words flow out like a distant echo of your own voice.

You talk about the importance of truth, though each sentence feels as if it’s bending and stretching, turning into shapes in the air before your eyes. You see syllables drifting upward like soap bubbles. Some in the audience reach out to gently pop them with their fingertips, and when they do, the sound of your voice changes timbre as if passing through a flute.

Suddenly you realize that the podium isn’t a podium at all. It’s a small, wooden boat bobbing in shallow water. Your notes and speech cards have scattered, turning into paper cranes that flap away through the chandelier lights overhead. The crowd applauds softly and their collective breath becomes a soft breeze, pushing your little boat gently forward. Now you’re drifting away from the stage, gliding over calm, moonlit water, heading toward a distant island where massive trees sway to the rhythm of invisible music.

A hush falls again, not from anxiety this time, but from anticipation. You find yourself still speaking—only now, you’re telling stories about journeys you’ve never taken and lessons you’ve never learned. Yet, these tales feel as if they’ve always lived inside you. The audience transforms: rows of them turning into tall cattails and reeds at the water’s edge. Their eyes remain, glowing warmly, embedded in the stalks. They nod approvingly with each phrase.

As your boat nears the island, you realize your speech has become a conversation. You are speaking and listening at once, and the voice that responds is your own, yet also everyone you’ve ever met. It reminds you that you’re dreaming, that these moments are your own creations. The audience, the boat, the words—they are all pieces of yourself rearranged into a stage scene. You feel both performer and spectator, teacher and student.

With this understanding, the words come smoothly, like a gentle stream. You talk about change, about accepting vulnerability, and about how even silence can have a melody if you listen closely enough. Your final words cause the distant island’s trees to burst into color—red, gold, violet, shimmering in impossible patterns. The applause you hear now is a rustling of leaves and a whisper of wind. The feeling in your chest is one of warmth and release, as though you have given something meaningful, and have also received something indescribably precious.

Then, as if on cue, the dream begins to fade. You see the stage lights dim, the audience blur into impressionistic swirls. You grasp the feeling of having spoken your truth, of having traveled without leaving the spot, and of having communicated something essential without ever knowing exactly what it was. You close your eyes within the dream, and when you open them, you awaken—still remembering the echoes of that impossible speech and the gentle applause of the reeds.
