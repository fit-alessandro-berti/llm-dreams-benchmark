**...find a way to prove your knowledge of the future without being labeled a madman or a heretic.**

The air smells of damp earth and woodsmoke as you step out of the small, thatched hut where you awoke. The sky is a deep, unbroken blue, and the sun hangs lower than you expected—*when* are you? The clothing of the few people you’ve seen suggests medieval Europe, but the architecture is unfamiliar. A woman in a rough-spun dress eyes you warily as you stumble past, muttering about "demon-touched strangers."

Your stomach growls. Food first. Then answers.

You follow the scent of baking bread to a bustling market square. Vendors hawk wares from wooden stalls—pottery, wool, iron tools, and strange, twisted roots you don’t recognize. A coin purse at your belt jingles when you move; inside, a few crudely stamped silver pieces. *Where did these come from?* You trade one for a loaf of dark bread and a clay cup of sour ale, listening to the chatter around you.

"...the king’s tax collectors come next week," a grizzled farmer grumbles.
"...saw a wolf with two heads near the old mill," whispers a wide-eyed boy.
"...the stars were wrong last night," murmurs an elderly woman, clutching a bundle of herbs.

Your mind races. *If this is the past, you have knowledge that could change everything.* But how? You could:
- **Predict an eclipse** (if you remember the dates) to prove your foresight.
- **Sketch future inventions**—a plow design, a water wheel, or even gunpowder (dangerous, but powerful).
- **Warn of a coming plague or war**—but would they believe you, or burn you for witchcraft?
- **Find the local scholar or priest**—someone who might listen, if you phrase your words carefully.

As you ponder, a commotion erupts at the edge of the square. A group of armored men on horseback ride in, their tabards bearing a crest you don’t recognize. The crowd parts nervously. One dismounts—a broad-shouldered man with a scar across his cheek—and scans the faces around him. His gaze locks onto yours.

**"You,"** he says, striding toward you. **"You’re not from here."**

Your pulse spikes. *Do you run? Lie? Or take the gamble and tell him the truth?*

**How would you like the dream to unfold next?**
- **Option 1:** You claim to be a traveler from a distant land, buying time to learn more.
- **Option 2:** You blurt out a prediction (e.g., "The river will flood in three days!"), testing their reaction.
- **Option 3:** You feign ignorance and let them take you to their leader—maybe this is your chance to influence history.
- **Option 4:** Something else entirely? (You choose!)
