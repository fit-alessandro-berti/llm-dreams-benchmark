The idyllic hush of the forest was shattered. A low growl, deep and guttural, rumbled through the trees, vibrating in my bones. The air, once warm and fragrant with pine needles, now turned frigid, a biting wind whipping through the leaves. A sickly green light seeped through the canopy, casting the moss-covered forest floor in an eerie, otherworldly glow.

Panic fluttered in my chest as dark, ominous clouds swallowed the sun. Rain began to fall, not in gentle drops, but in sheets of ice, each flake stinging my exposed skin.  The wind roared, howling like a banshee, twisting the branches into menacing shapes.

Through the kaleidoscope of the storm, I saw it – a towering figure coalescing from the heart of the tempest. Its form shifted and swirled, taking shape as it grew, limbs stretching like vines, eyes burning like embers. This was no ordinary storm; it was a manifestation of raw, primal power, and I was its target.

Frozen in place, fear gripping me, I watched as the figure lunged. Its voice, a deafening cacophony, boomed in my head, words I couldn't quite grasp, but felt deep within my soul.  Then, the world dissolved into a dizzying blur of green and grey, the storm's fury engulfing me completely.


And I woke with a gasp, heart pounding, the remnants of the dream clinging to me like cobwebs.  

The sunlight streaming through my window felt warm and almost holy compared to the icy touch of the storm.  A shiver ran down my spine, and I looked out at the clear blue sky, a silent prayer of gratitude escaping my lips.  But even as the sun bathed the room in its golden light, I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched, the echo of that primal voice whispering in the back of my mind.
