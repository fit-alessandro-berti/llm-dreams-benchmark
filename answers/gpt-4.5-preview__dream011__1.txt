written in a strange, indecipherable language. You glance around nervously, seeing that everyone else quietly scribbles down their answers, oblivious to your confusion.

You flip through the pages, hoping desperately to recognize even a single familiar word or image, but every question only seems more unfamiliar than the last. Anxiety starts to rise, your heart racing as you peek at the clock, its hands spinning wildly out of control, refusing to settle on any particular time.

Suddenly, a soft hum echoes through the classroom, and you realize you're no longer in a recognizable space. The walls around you fall away, leaving you suspended in a vast sky surrounded by drifting clouds and countless floating fragments of paper carrying the mysterious writing.

A distant voice, warm and reassuring, whispers, "You already have everything you need. Just trust yourself."

Calmed by this gentle voice, you close your eyes, take a deep breath, and reopen them. Now, the language starts to shift slowly, rearranging itself until something clicks inside you—you begin to understand the message it carries. Each incomprehensible word now forms clear thoughts, questions appear as friendly guiding riddles, and one by one, you confidently fill in your answers.

When the last question is finished, you rise up from your desk, and the clouds begin to clear, revealing a breathtaking, sunlit path ahead. You smile, feeling at peace, knowing you've passed the exam not because you knew every answer, but because you discovered something valuable within yourself:

You have everything you need to face whatever challenges may lie ahead.
