...each group seems to be speaking a language that’s *almost* familiar—the cadence of English, but words rearranging themselves into slippery, shifting phrases. One group near a towering ice sculpture (shaped like a crumbling lighthouse) keeps chanting, *"The key is the lock is the door is the key,"* while rotating keys made of frozen light in their palms. I can’t stay; their rhythm makes my thoughts fuzzy.  

Pushing deeper into the warm, honey-colored light of the main hall, I spot a woman laughing with a cluster of people wearing masks of smooth river stones. Her hair—a cascade of deep auburn—is identical to my best friend Lena’s. Relief floods me. "Lena!" I call, weaving through guests whose clothes seem woven from shadow and starlight.  

She turns. The face beneath the auburn hair is wrong—too many eyes blink slowly on her smooth skin, like petals opening. "Not Lena," she intones, her voice layered with whispers. "But you can borrow her shape. For a price." Her hand extends, offering not a hand, but a small, live hummingbird suspended in glass. Its wings blur like trapped light.  

I stumble back, heart hammering. That’s when I see *him*: my actual friend, Ben, standing utterly still by a potted weeping willow tree with leaves of silver foil. He’s mouthing words, but no sound comes out. Worse—ink-black liquid is seeping from the corners of his eyes, trailing down his cheeks like tears made of tar.  

I rush toward him, dodging a group juggling glowing pocket watches that drip molten numbers onto the floor. "Ben! What’s happening?"  

He grips my arm, his skin icy. "You have to leave," he hisses, voice raw, as if speaking through gravel. "They’re not *people*. They’re echoes. And they’re hungry." He points a trembling finger toward the arched doorway I’d entered. Now it’s gone, replaced by a wall of shifting, breathing wallpaper depicting endless spiraling staircases.  

"The rules changed," Ben whispers, ink still welling in his eyes. "You weren’t supposed to see us like this. Find the door made of breath. Before the silence swallows the music."  

Around us, the air begins to thin. The laughter turns tinny and distant. The hum of conversation flatlines into a single, sustained note that vibrates in my molars. I look down—my own hands are becoming transparent, the chandelier light shining *through* my fingers like stained glass.  

Panic spikes. *The door made of breath.* I close my eyes, focusing on the memory of wind: the rush of opening a car window on a highway, the puff when blowing out birthday candles... I step toward the wallpaper, inhaling deeply, and blow.  

A ripple distorts the spirals. For a heartbeat, the wall thins into gauze, revealing moonlight and the faint outline of an oak door. I lunge—  

And Ben’s cold hand closes over my wrist, pulling me back into the silent, bright nightmare. His voice is a thread: *"You can’t wake up. You brought the dream with you."*  

The hummingbird in the glass cage beats frantic wings. The staircases on the wall start to descend.
