and you nod because that’s what mouths do in offices. You sit. The chair breathes once under you like a patient animal. Your keyboard has gone soft at the edges, keys slightly concave as if someone has been scooping time out of them with a spoon.

“Before noon,” your boss says, checking a watch that is also a tiny mirror. In it, your face looks like it’s waiting for instructions from somewhere beyond your skin. The second hand jitters, a silver mosquito. Before noon was five minutes ago. The timestamp on the email says yesterday. The subject line says URGENT in a color that doesn’t exist outside of anxiety.

You open the project folder. Inside is a single file labeled Now. You double-click and a window blossoms into a long white corridor. The requirements are walking toward you on legs made of bullet points. “We need the ocean categorized by tone,” one says. “We need a map of every decision you didn’t make,” another says. “We need it clean. We need it beautiful. We need it done.”

You start typing anyway, because your fingers have been trained to find letters even when the letters are trying to escape. On the screen, your words don’t appear as words. They sprout, green and tentative, curling into vines that wrap the corners of the window. Each sentence makes a small sound like someone dropping a spoon into a drawer. Your boss stands by your desk, tie swinging like a pendulum, making a tiny breeze in the place where your attention should be.

The wall clock across from you is wide and white, a dinner plate with black numbers like seeds. It ticks, ticks, ticks, and then the second hand lifts and flies off, a dragonfly that skims the surface of the water cooler and disappears into the little blue.

You swallow. Your mouth tastes faintly of old paper. You try to print time by hitting Control-P, but the printer coughs out leaves. The leaves are sticky notes with days written on them in your own handwriting. Monday peels itself off and drifts toward the window. Friday folds itself into a paper plane and lands in your coffee. You fish it out and it whispers, “No.”

The email pings again. Your inbox is a flock of birds, wheeling. Subject lines scatter. There is a message from your first-grade teacher. There is a reminder to drink water from a plant on your windowsill that you do not own.

“Status?” your boss asks. His voice is a stapler, clicking emphatically. He is smiling the way people do when they are measuring you. You feel the deadline: a thin black thread stretched taut across the carpet between your desk and the door, ankle-high, a tripline with a small tag that says DO NOT CROSS written in the invisible ink of consequences.

You pick up your mouse and it squirms, a warm white pebble. You place it gently back down. The cursor on your screen is a moth battering itself against the edge of the window. You put your palm over your chest to steady the portion of you that wants to run. Your heart obeys, half a beat late.

There is a moment—the fluorescent lights hum, and in their hum you hear vowels. There is a quiet like the space between a question and its answer. In that silence, you remember.

Right: You are dreaming.

The thought is a switch. The window brightens. The sky outside is a corkboard studded with suns, pushpins glinting like tiny heads of nails. You stand, and gravity tilts politely to let you. You take hold of the boss’s swinging tie, and it clicks into your hand like a metronome being turned off. He doesn’t seem to mind. He is already softening around the edges, becoming less boss and more coat on a chair.

You go to the wall clock. With two fingers, you lift the glass face; it comes away as easily as a lid from a jar. Inside, minutes are nested like coins. They are heavier than you expect. You take a handful and put them in your pocket. They chime like small dishes when they touch.

You return to your desk and pour the minutes into the project. They slip through the screen with the satisfying sound of something expensive landing in velvet. The vines on your monitor thicken, flower, and then fold themselves neatly into paragraphs. Your cursor moth settles on a line and becomes an arrowhead. The file labeled Now gently changes to Done.

“Perfect,” someone says. It might be you. It might be the plant you don’t own. Your boss is a silhouette of approval, stamp-shaped, then a stamp, then a right angle of sunlight on the carpet. The deadline thread across the floor loosens, droops, curls into a lazy question mark, and rolls itself under the filing cabinet like a napping cat.

You click Print again and this time the printer obliges. Paper feeds warm and sure into your hand. The pages smell like rain on hot pavement. The cover page is a mirror; your name is written there in a typeface that makes your shoulders drop.

You walk the pages over. The office is longer than it was, or shorter; it doesn’t matter. You place the work in the sunlight where your boss used to be. The sunlight flips through the document rapidly, as if scanning for something egregious and finding only the arc of your own breath laid out in clean black lines.

“Right on time,” the room says.

Then, from far away, a sound begins, thin as floss, threading into everything. The fluorescent hum tunes itself into something like birds. The clock face you left open fills again with glass as if poured, and the minutes you didn’t take hop back into their slots. The sunlight climbs the edge of your desk like a cat and becomes a spill of warmth on your wrist.

You look down at your hands, at their competent strangeness. You think, I should write this down. You aim your mouth at that thought, but the birdsong tightens into a single clear bell. The office window is a rectangle of morning.

You open your eyes into it. The deadline is gone, collapsed into a line of light across the floor, which is just the day waiting, which is not impossible at all. You breathe. You remember that the project, whatever it is, can start now.
