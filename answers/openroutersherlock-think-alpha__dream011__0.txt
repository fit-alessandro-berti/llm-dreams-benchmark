written in a language you've never seen before—swirling symbols that look like dancing spaghetti mixed with emoji. Panic sets in as you flip through the pages: Question 1 asks, "What color is the sound of Tuesday?" with multiple choices like "A) Teal whispers" or "D) The scream of a forgotten sock."

You start scribbling nonsense answers, but suddenly the pencil turns into a live snake that slithers off the desk. The proctor, who was your childhood pet goldfish (somehow wearing glasses), swims through the air and announces, "Time's up! Now for the practical portion: juggle these flaming pineapples while reciting pi to 500 digits backward."

Chaos erupts—desks sprout legs and run away, classmates morph into cartoon characters debating quantum physics. You grab a pineapple, but it explodes into a flock of tiny birds that carry you upward through the ceiling into a starry sky where the exam paper unfurls into a giant map leading to... your bed?

You wake up sweating, heart pounding, glance at the clock—it's 3 AM. Just a dream. Or is it? Your alarm buzzes: "Final Exam Simulation Complete. Career Path: Professional Dream Weaver."
