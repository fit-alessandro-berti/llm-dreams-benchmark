symbols etched into its surface—swirling vines that seem to pulse with a faint, ethereal glow, as if breathing in time with your own heartbeat. Your fingers trace the lines, and suddenly, the patterns shift like liquid silver, reforming into a map of stars you've never seen, guiding you toward an unseen horizon.

The box grows warm in your hands, humming a low melody that echoes the whispers of forgotten languages. Compelled by an unseen force, you press your palm against the center, where a single rune blooms like a flower under moonlight. There's no click of a lock, no grind of metal—only a soft sigh, as if the box itself exhales in relief.

It unfolds like origami crafted by dreams, panels blooming outward into a miniature garden of crystal flowers that chime softly in an unfelt breeze. At its heart lies not treasure, but a mirror, small and flawless, reflecting not your face, but a version of you standing at the edge of a vast ocean under twin suns. That you turns, smiles knowingly, and extends a hand.

You reach for it, and the world tilts. The box dissolves into stardust that swirls around you, pulling you through the mirror's surface. The ocean welcomes you with waves of liquid light, carrying you toward shores where the stars dip their toes into the sand. And as you wash ashore, laughing in the surreal joy of it all, you awaken—not with a start, but with the lingering scent of salt and the echo of that impossible melody, wondering if the box was ever locked at all.
