You are in themiddle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to… **walk. Just completely turn and walk. Not storm off dramatically, no throwing back sharp words. Simply turn around and start striding forward, focusing only on the feeling beneath your feet.****

The change is instant, a vacuum left hanging where harsh sentences once crackled. The world shifts. The familiar, brick-clad cafe walls—where the fight had begun—blur, fading into a lush, improbably-bright forest teeming with iridescent plants I’ve never seen before. Giant mushrooms pulsed with their own internal light, casting long, shifting shadows across a soft carpet of mossy leaves. 

The argument dissolves entirely. It's not even a lingering frustration; it's like it never was. I'm not thinking *why* I’m here, just that I **am**. There’s silence here, not a tense or sad silence, but a vibrant, humming lull that feels ancient and comforting. Birds sing in tones that seem composed of pure emotion - joy interwoven with sorrow in unexpected rhythms.

As I walk deeper, the forest *itself*, bizarrely, begins responding to me.  The giant mushrooms bow a subtle nod as I pass. Tiny, luminous butterflies flutter closer, dancing about my head. I feel a strange lightness, a detaching.  The friend, their face and the argument and everything… it drifts farther and farther behind me. Replaced by a growing sense of curious relief, not relief *at* ending the fight, but relief simply *to be* – adrift and alone, yet somehow connected to the breathing, glowing world around me.

Then I see it. Ahead, through gaps in the pulsating flora, is a shimmering object hanging just inches above the ground.  It’s… a key. Crafted from smooth obsidian shot through with lines of flickering gold.  Not just a random key. I know, deep within me, that this key fits *something*.

As I reach for the key, my surroundings abruptly swirl. Everything accelerates--the glowing mushrooms become blurs of color, the butterflies coalesce into whirling sparks - and as they do so, a gentle hand rests on my shoulder. 
I turn slowly.  It’s him. My friend. Not angry now. His face is soft, filled with a hesitant understanding that mirrors the one I feel blossoming within me. “I... I was afraid,” he whispers, his voice trembling, "that you'd choose silence."


 And then, I’m waking up. The faint glow of the bedside lamp replaces the bioluminescent forest.  The key, of course, is gone as well. But the warmth—the quiet, profound relief of walking away—lingers with me.  That and a powerful sense—not of resolution to that fight, per se—but something fundamentally closer than before – an offering of silent understanding. A chance to find a new lock.
