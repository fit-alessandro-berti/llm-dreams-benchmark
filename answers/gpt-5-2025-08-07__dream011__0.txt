…not printed so much as breathing. The words swell and settle like the surface of a pond. You blink, and the ink rearranges itself, letters slipping on their stems, numbers exhaling into curves. The first question tastes faintly of peppermint when you read it, a coolness at the back of your throat: Define your terms.

Your pencil is already in your hand, though you don’t remember picking it up. It’s heavier than you think it should be, warm as a small animal. You glance around for reassurance, for anyone else who might be seeing their paper ripple like this, but your classmates are at a distance that isn’t quite measurable—too far to touch, too close to ignore, each seated at a desk just like yours, wood worn smooth by generations of anxious hands, and yet their outlines flicker as if they’re underwater. The proctor at the front, a hunched figure in a cardigan, is a blur of cardigan-ness and authority; their face is an idea more than a face. A clock over the board ticks, but the sound is your heartbeat.

Define your terms. The page sighs. The words you’ve been saving for occasions like this—habit, vocation, success, stability—line up like well-behaved children in your mind. You can label them; you can pin them down. When the pencil touches paper, the graphite leaves a streak that looks like a path through grass. The first line writes itself: I am a person who— The sentence refuses to finish. Your hand hesitates. The line elongates, becomes a road that curves towards the margin and disappears.

“Time has started,” says the proctor, except it’s not a voice you hear through your ears so much as an idea that arrives fully formed in your chest. Time nods. Time is polite.

You move to the second question. It’s written in your handwriting, which is confusing, because you haven’t written it yet. It says: Explain the mechanism by which you will forgive yourself for not having known in advance what only living could teach you. Show your work.

You remember how to show your work: boxes and steps, arrows indicating cause and effect, neat proofs that link assumption to conclusion. You draw an arrow; it bends into a fish. The fish swims off the page, scales flashing, circles the stapled corner of the exam, and disappears beneath the desk. Someone coughs three rows over. The sound turns into a flock of blackbirds that lift from the margin and scatter across the ceiling tiles, leaving tiny notes of punctuation trailing behind them.

This is not fair, you think, and then you think—No, this is familiar. It’s the dream where the thing you’ve prepared for becomes a different thing, which reveals that you were preparing for that too.

Question three has no words. It’s a photograph glued to the paper. In the photograph, you are seven, in a backyard you haven’t seen in fifteen years. There is a sprinkler arcing rainbows, and your mother, barefoot on the grass, is handing you a towel. The towel is the color of an orange dawn. The question mark is in the corner of the photo, embroidered into the fabric of the towel. You look up at the proctor as if to say, Is this allowed? The proctor is now your high school physics teacher, except they are also your first boss, and also the stranger on the bus who once gave you a seat when your hands were full. They are nodding and writing something in the air with a piece of chalk that leaves no dust.

Your pencil has grown a leaf. You pluck it without thinking, and it releases a little sigh like a page turned in a quiet room. You write: I will forgive myself by failure in increments, by touching soft animals, by taking walks along the same block until it becomes a country. I will leave blank spaces for the answers to arrive. Your handwriting, for once, is legible. It looks like someone you trust wrote it.

The ticking clock is louder now, but every tick is a lighthouse flash rather than a threat. The fourth question is mechanical, straightforward. Given these constraints, optimize for joy. Subject to: rent, geography, weather, inherited fears, the way your hands sometimes tremble. Include boundary conditions. You breathe in and begin to draw the graph. The axes sprout like saplings. The curve that would maximize joy is a bell that tilts, a hammock strung between two trees. You label the trees with names: Tuesday and Next Year. Somewhere between them, right around now, the hammock sags comfortably. You plot a point and label it you.

The paper rustles, pleased. The proctor—the friend, the mother, the stranger, the weathered cardigan—has come down the aisle, shoes whispering. They lean slightly over your shoulder. You brace for correction, for that tightening of shoulders you know so well as you prepare to be told you are wrong. Instead, the proctor takes your pencil gently and writes beside your graph: Or. They draw a second hammock, lower. They draw a third, higher. They circle the word subject and turn it into a little sun.

Other students have begun to stand, to hand in their papers, to dissolve into corridors that appear where the walls of the exam hall used to be. One walks into a forest. One steps into an elevator that opens onto the ocean. One becomes a river. You feel the old surge of envy, then the quieter tide of recognition: those doors have their names on them. Yours is here, not yet inked. The fifth question waits without impatience.

It is a single word. Choose.

You look down at your clothes and do not recognize them. You look at your hands and do. The page, very faintly, has lines that look like the palm of your right hand. You place your hand over them; your life line and the paper’s line match for a moment, then diverge, then cross again like two people in a city who keep rounding different corners at different times.

Choose, the paper says, not unkindly. The exam decides to help. It, too, is anxious for you to do well. The question splits, offering options: A) the version where you never disappoint anyone. B) the version where your heart remains unbroken and therefore unopened. C) the version where you are forever competent at the thing that is killing you softly. D) Other.

Your pencil hovers. You have spent entire years on A; you have lived inside the parentheses of C; you understand the quiet appeal of B, that smooth stone in the pocket. Your hand moves to D and stops. Choosing D doesn’t tell the exam anything. It is not an answer; it is a deferral. The pencil’s point blunts, and in that softening, you remember the feeling of grass under your bare feet, the towel your mother handed you, the heat of the day, the way you didn’t choose those things so much as enter them.

You circle the margin, a place no one expects to be looked at, and you write there, small: I choose to be a beginner.

When your pencil lifts, the paper shivers. The questions rearrange themselves around that sentence, like furniture moving to make space for a piano. New blanks appear: Where will beginners go? What will you ask them? What will you make together? The exam, which was a gate a moment ago, becomes a window.

There is a murmur, weak at first, then stronger: the class is humming, dozens of throats vibrating a note that has the taste of salt and oranges, chalk and rain. The proctor sets down their chalk and begins to hum as well. The ceiling floats higher, lightening. The blackbirds return, perching on the sprinkler arc in the photograph, dripping commas.

You glance at the clock and realize it is not a clock at all but a porthole. Through it, you see not numbers but weather: a sky moving across itself, quicksilver and patient. Time has indeed started, but it hasn’t decided to stop anywhere in particular. You can hand in your paper whenever you like. You can stay until the janitor turns off the lights. You can take the paper with you and keep answering, out in the corridor where the doors bloom like evening flowers, out in the street where the bus arrives without a schedule and somehow always on time.

You stand. Your knees sound like pages. The desk is warm where your forearms were resting, a heat that feels like proof. You gather the exam, which is lighter now, which flutters in your hand as if it has a heartbeat of its own. You walk to the front. The proctor takes the paper and looks at you the way lamplight looks at a window: not penetrating, but present. Their eyes are your eyes, older and kinder.

“Did you answer everything?” they ask, the cardigan smelling like chalk and rain.

“Enough,” you say, and your voice is not a guess.

As you turn to leave, the room rearranges quietly. The aisle becomes a path through tall grass. The fluorescent lights become stars you didn’t know had been on all day. The door is a door is a door. Your classmates walk with you for a while and then peel off, their exits practical and miraculous—one fades into a subway tunnel, one climbs a ladder into a library shelf, one puts on a coat and disappears into snow that has arrived out of a clear sky.

You reach for the handle and find your hand wants to write one more thing. You turn the paper over, the blank back that was never meant for answers, and you write to the you who will wake up: It wasn’t a test. It was a rehearsal. There is a difference.

Then you open the door and step into a corridor that smells like oranges, and somewhere far away an alarm begins to sing—not a siren, but that same low note everyone was humming, and with the simple, ridiculous courage of the newly awake, you carry it with you.
