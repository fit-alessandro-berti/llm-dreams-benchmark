As you navigate through the bustling gathering, the air hums with laughter and the clink of glasses. The crowd shifts in waves, and you catch fleeting glances of people locked in animated conversations, their faces glowing in the warm light.

Then, you see them—your only acquaintance—standing near a tall bookshelf, engrossed in conversation with a stranger. They glance up, spot you, and wave you over with an apologetic smile. As you approach, the stranger—an older woman with sharp, knowing eyes—turns to you and says, *"Ah, you must be the one they’ve been waiting for. We were just discussing time."*

Before you can respond, the bookshelf behind them wobbles, and the titles on the spine begin to rearrange themselves into an unfamiliar language. The woman’s expression darkens. *"Oh dear,"* she murmurs. *"It’s happening again."*

The floor beneath you tilts slightly, and the murmur of the crowd fades into a distant hum. The walls expand, stretching the room into something vast and unrecognizable.

Your friend grabs your arm. *"Don’t look at your hands,"* they whisper urgently.

You don’t.

But the realization sets in anyway: this dream has its own rules, and you’re already part of them.

What happens next?
