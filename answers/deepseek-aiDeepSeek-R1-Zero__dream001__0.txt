\boxed{You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to frantically check your pockets and find a crumpled piece of paper with an address and a name you don’t recognize. You flag down a taxi and show the driver the address. He nods knowingly and drives off through a maze of streets. The buildings outside blur into a mix of modern skyscrapers and ancient, gothic structures that make no sense geographically.

As the taxi weaves through the city, you notice that the clock on the dashboard is moving faster than normal. You try to stay calm by rehearsing what you need to say at the meeting, but your mind keeps blanking.

The taxi eventually stops in front of a grand, imposing building. You pay the driver and rush inside. The lobby is filled with people who all seem to know where they are going. You check the directory board and find the room number for your meeting.

With minutes to spare, you make it to the conference room. Just as you are about to enter, you realize you have no idea what the meeting is about or who you are meeting with. The door opens, and a group of faces turns to look at you—some familiar, some not.

One of them stands up and says, "We've been waiting for you. It's time to make a decision." You step into the room, and the door closes behind you, leaving a sense of both relief and new anxiety as the dream fades into another scene or ends abruptly.}
