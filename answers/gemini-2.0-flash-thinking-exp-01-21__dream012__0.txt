... plant your feet firmly on the pitching deck, the salt spray stinging your face, and grip the worn wooden helm, your knuckles white.  Taking a deep breath that tastes of brine and fear, you raise your voice above the howling wind, issuing commands that are sharp and clear, a beacon of resolve in the heart of the tempest.  You feel the tremors of the ship beneath you, hear the cracking of timbers, and the terrified cries of the seagulls circling above, yet your gaze remains fixed on the churning waves ahead.  **"Hard to port! Batten down the hatches! All hands on deck!"** you roar, your voice cutting through the chaos.  **"We will weather this storm! We always have!"**  A flicker of doubt might prickle at the edge of your mind – *have we always?* – but you instantly squash it down.  Your crew needs strength, not uncertainty.  You must be the anchor in this swirling madness, the unwavering point of direction in a world turned sideways.  And as a monstrous wave crashes over the bow, drenching you to the bone and momentarily blinding you, you taste the salt, feel the raw power of the ocean, and know, with a strange, dreamlike certainty, that this storm, like all storms, will eventually pass.  Your job, your only job, is to ensure your ship, and your crew, survive until it does.
