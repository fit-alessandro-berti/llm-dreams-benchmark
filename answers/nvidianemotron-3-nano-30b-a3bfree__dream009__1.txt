You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **understand the rhythm of this world before you can hope to ever return home**.

The air smells of damp earth and distant firewood, and the faint hum of insects is punctuated only by the occasional clank of metal on metal. Towering stone arches, etched with looping glyphs that seem to pulse with an ancient light, frame a narrow cobblestone street that winds like a living vein through a bustling market town. Merchants in hand‑woven tunics hawk spices and silks, their voices rising and falling like a chorus from a bygone age. A distant cathedral bell tolls the hour, its resonant tone echoing off the cobbles and stirring a thrill of both awe and unease deep within you.

You glance down at your own clothing—soft linen tunic, a simple belt, and worn leather boots—realizing you are clothed as if you had stepped straight out of a portrait from the 14th century. No devices cling to your skin, no screens flicker in your peripheral vision. The only thing you carry is a small, smooth stone tucked in your pocket, warm to the touch and humming faintly when you hold it close to your ear.

Instinct tells you that this stone is a key—perhaps a relic from the world you left, or a token that will guide you through this one. You feel an urgent need to **find a place where the stone can be recognized, studied, or perhaps used**. The first clue lies in the market’s center, where a forecaster with eyes as sharp as hawk’s scans the crowd, reading the patterns of the stalls and the movements of the townsfolk. He pauses, his gaze locking onto you, and whispers in a language you somehow understand:

*“The stone knows the gate that never opens, but only when the moon is full and the river sings.”*

The river—an iron‑bound bridge arches over a silver‑glinting stream that winds around the town, its waters ticking like a slow‑beating heart. The moon, now a thin crescent, hints at a waiting promise. You realize that the next step isn’t merely to locate the stone’s purpose, but to **wait for the right moment—when the celestial and earthly cycles align—to uncover the hidden doorway that could bridge two eras**.

Thus begins your quest: to observe, listen, and learn the subtle beats of this medieval world, to decode its symbols, to follow the river’s song, and to seek the gate that will let you step back—or perhaps forward—through time. Every sunrise brings new clues; every night sky writes a new possibility. And somewhere, hidden behind a tapestry of legends and stone, the answer awaits, patient as the ages themselves.
