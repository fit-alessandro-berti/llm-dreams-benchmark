**The Dream Continues:**

You walk through the city, the sound of distant voices and rustling leaves filling the air. The sky is a swirl of colors you don’t recognize, and the buildings twist and bend in ways that defy logic. You feel a strange weight in your chest, as if your heartbeat is syncing with something greater than yourself.

A door creaks in the distance. You follow it, drawn by an unseen force. The path winds through alleys lit by soft, golden lights that seem to pulse with a life of their own. You reach a narrow staircase that spirals upward, and with a deep breath, you descend.

The next door opens with a sigh, revealing a forest-like interior filled with towering trees made of glass and shadow. The air smells like lavender and ozone. You step inside, and the world around you shifts—time slows, and every detail becomes hyper-real.

Suddenly, you hear a whisper in your mind: *“Where are you going?”* You turn to see a figure standing beside you—another you? Or is it just a dream? The figure’s eyes glow with a soft blue light, and they speak in a voice that feels both familiar and foreign.

“You're safe,” they say. “You're not alone.”

You freeze. The dream shifts again, and you find yourself standing in a library with endless books floating in midair. A version of you opens one, and the pages whisper secrets about the meeting you missed. Another version appears, trembling, holding a small lantern.

The dream begins to unravel, but you feel a surge of clarity. You realize the meeting is not just important—it’s a key. The city is a mirror, reflecting your subconscious. The journey is about finding your true path.

With a deep breath, you take a step forward. The dream shifts again, and you find yourself back in the city square, the meeting looming. But this time, you’re ready.
