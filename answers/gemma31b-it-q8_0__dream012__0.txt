You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew look to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you feel a dizzying, terrifying stillness. The sails whip relentlessly, nearly tearing at your arms, and the darkness rolls inward, swallowing half the horizon. Then, just as you think the ships will abandon this wretched place, you see it – a single, colossal eye, embedded perfectly in the turbulent waves. It pulses with a bruised purple light, and with each crest of the gale, it shifts – not just with its eye, but with its *thoughts*. 

It’s not judgment. It's *story*. The eye doesn’t speak in words, but in patterns – deep, mournful melodies constructed of wind and water, fractal designs of ships lost and never found.  As its presence intensifies, you realize the churning, frothing storm is *it*, a massive grief-repository for all the ships that had crashed onto the seabed over millennia. 

A strange calmness settles across your own soul. Remembering your father – a man who knew these depths as intimately as he knew the stars – you understand the eye’s intention. It's not to destroy, but to *contain*. Hold the storm at bay until something of worth – some kind of truth, perhaps – can find its way through. 

Suddenly, the ship shatters. But not in a violent crash. The waves hesitate. The storm, momentarily subdued by the enormous, luminous eye, slowly begins to unravel, releasing not violent spray, but thousands of tiny spheres shimmering with captured moonlight – fragments of lost constellations. And nestled amidst these shimmering pieces, you see a single, perfectly formed shell, radiating a gentle, otherworldly warmth. 


You instinctively grasp it. As you do, an old melody drifts within, a haunting tune of navigation, of courage, of the boundless beauty swallowed by the deep, carried not by your ship’s crew, but... by your father. 

Does it feel like… a map?
