You decide to **build a community**. Scavenging what remains of the old world, you gather survivors—each with different skills—under one banner: *the New Dawn*. You turn an abandoned factory into a fortress, reinforcing walls with scrap metal and barricades, and rigging solar panels to power a makeshift hospital.

One night, while patrolling the perimeter, you spot a strange light in the distance. Against warnings, you investigate and find a group of **Nomads**—wanderers who speak of a hidden oasis where the land is green and the water runs clean. But the road is perilous. Predators, rogue factions, and the ever-present threat of radiation wait to claim the weak.

You have a choice:
1. **Follow the Nomads**—risk everything for a chance at life.
2. **Stay and Fortify**—build walls higher, but wonder if this is all there will ever be.
3. **Find Another Path**—rumors speak of an old subway network leading underground. Is it a haven or a death trap?

What do you do?
