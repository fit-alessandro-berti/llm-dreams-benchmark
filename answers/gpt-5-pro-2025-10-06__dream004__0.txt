and you realize the word itself is carved into the wooden frame—AND—as if the canvas is a hinge, not a surface. It breathes. The so-called blank is not empty but the color of held breath, of snowfall that hasn’t decided where to land.

A brush is already in your hand. You’re not certain when it arrived. Its handle is warm like a hand you recognize, and its bristles are soft as moth wings. Beside the easel, a shallow dish of paints quietly rearranges itself, puddles of color sliding into each other and apart again. None of them have names you learned while awake; they hum their names to you: hush, sudden, tomorrow, salt, almost. One smells like citrus and rain on warm stone. Another tastes, inexplicably, like a bell struck far away.

You touch the tip of the brush to the canvas. The first line you make is not a line at all but a sound. It threads out of the bristles and across the surface in a tone you feel in your ribs. The landscape around you pauses, listening: a mountain that had been folding and unfolding like an origami animal stops to look. A flock of paper birds in the distance turns into triangles and then back into birds again, circling, curious.

When the sound-line settles, it becomes visible, something between a shadow and a horizon. Where it is, the world steadies. The river’s color, which has been flipping through the spectrum like a deck of cards, rests on a patient blue you can finally recognize as water. A tree nearby commits to being a tree and grows a heartbeat. A circle rolling past makes up its mind to be the moon, and then, kindly, two moons.

You dip into the dish again and lift out a small, precise dot of a color that whispers later. With it you paint a staircase. Not a staircase—no edges, no risers: the idea of a way up. As you lift the brush, the staircase extrudes itself into the air beside you, built from pauses and the smell of old books. You set your foot on the first step and it holds. Your balance returns like a song you used to know.

The word on the frame warms under your fingers. AND. You press it without meaning to, the way you would press a bruise: gently, to test if it’s still there. The frame splits along the grain, not breaking but unfurling, and the canvas opens like a door on its unseen seam. The light behind it is a different kind of white—whiter, as if all the unmade things are gathered there, patient and humming.

Inside is a room that is also a field. It is close and vast at once. The floor is made of commas you can lie in if you are tired. Periods are scattered like pebbles. Exclamation points stand at attention, lampposts and saplings. The air smells like pencil shavings, lemon, and the sky after lightning. In the middle of it all stands a small table with a single object on it: another brush, this one stubby and bright with use. A child version of you is there, legs swinging from a chair too tall, coloring with great seriousness inside a book whose pages turn into birds when you glance away.

They don’t look up. They say, without a mouth moving, Don’t paint what you see. Paint what sees you.

You look down at your hands. Your left palm has picked up a smudge of a color that can only be called first. Your right hand is still holding the moth-wing brush. The room-field is watching you the way a forest watches: full of eyes that are leaves, attentive without urgency.

You paint a door on the inside of the door you just walked through, because this is a dream and repetition is a way of telling the truth. The paint blooms into wood and hinge, and for the handle you paint a word you know by heart. It is not a name exactly. It is the taste of laughter and the weight of your favorite object and the sound of someone calling you back to the table for dinner. When you touch the handle, the door warms, and on the other side you can hear your life, not as events but as weather—sometimes clear, sometimes storm, always changing.

You hesitate. The changing world behind you rustles, restless and lovely. You could stay. You could learn how to paint rest into a sky, how to coax a shape to reveal its gentlest self. You could paint a boat and a shore to move between. You could paint quiet. You could paint a word that means “let me keep this.”

The child version of you slides off the chair. They come to stand beside you and hold your sleeve the way children do when they don’t know if they should speak. Their hand is sticky with a color named after the way your mother said goodnight. They look at you with your own eyes. We never draw the end, they explain solemnly. We draw the door.

You step through the door you painted. You feel the brushstroke of the threshold, the line you made earlier vibrating under your feet like a taut string. As you pass, some of the colors lean after you, curious. A bit of tomorrow gets on your cuff. The word on the frame slides back into the wood grain as if it was never there, as if it always will be.

You are in a room that is not the room, but it rhymes with it. The ceiling is your ceiling if you squint. The night at your window is the night you know. Your heart arranges itself around a rhythm that belongs here. You set the brush down. It clicks against the table, a small sound that says now.

When you lift your hand, there is a smudge of color on your fingertip you cannot name in waking languages. It is the exact shade of a thought you were about to have. You bring it to your mouth without thinking and touch it to your tongue. It tastes like oranges and the first time you stood up too fast and saw stars.

Outside, the world goes on changing, as all faithful worlds do. Inside, your breath finds itself. You lie down. The last thing you see before you sleep your way out of the dream is the blank canvas where it stands again in the corner, quietly breathing, patient as a held chord, waiting for the next time your hand reaches for the hinge and says, and.
