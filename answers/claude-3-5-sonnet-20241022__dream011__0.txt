I'll continue this dream scenario:

You notice the questions are written in a mysterious script you've never seen before - the symbols seem to shift and dance across the page like living creatures. Panicked, you look around the room and realize all your fellow students are calmly writing their answers, seemingly able to understand the bizarre text perfectly.

When you try to ask the proctor for help, your voice comes out as musical notes instead of words. The classroom begins to slowly tilt sideways, but nobody else seems to notice. Your pencil turns into a small bird that flutters away, and your blank exam paper starts folding itself into an origami boat.

As your anxiety peaks, you suddenly remember that in an earlier dream, you were given a special pair of glasses that could translate any language. You reach into your pocket and, sure enough, they're there. But when you put them on, instead of seeing the exam questions, you see messages from your future self giving you all the life advice you'll need for your career path...

(This captures the surreal, anxiety-driven nature of exam dreams while taking an unexpected turn toward resolution through dream logic.)

How would you like the dream to continue?
