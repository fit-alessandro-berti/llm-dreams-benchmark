You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and **each seems trapped in a strange, repeating loop**. One cluster of guests endlessly toasts with glasses that refill with liquid time—golden hours dripping onto the floor, pooling around their shoes. Another circle speaks in reverse, their words unraveling into smoke that forms half-finished letters hovering above their heads. You step closer to a third group, only to realize they’re all reflections of one another, shifting faces like pages in a book no one is reading.  

When you finally spot your friend across the room, they’re frozen mid-sentence, lips moving but soundless, surrounded by a halo of flickering candles that burn without wax. You reach for them, but the space between you stretches into a hallway of doors—each slightly ajar, each revealing fragments of memories you’ve never lived. A child’s laughter echoes, then stops. A clock ticks backward.  

You wake up at the moment you entered the party, clutching a invitation written in your own handwriting, dated yesterday.
