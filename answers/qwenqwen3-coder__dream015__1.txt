...decide to plant a garden.

In this desolate landscape, you discover a small pocket of fertile soil beneath the rubble of what was once a suburban backyard. Against all odds, you find a few seeds in an abandoned shed—tomato seeds, bean seeds, and something that might be sunflower seeds.

You work carefully, rationing your precious water, clearing away debris, and coaxing life from the earth. It's absurdly hopeful in a world that seems to have given up on tomorrow, but something deep within you refuses to let go of the idea that things can grow, that beauty and sustenance can emerge from ruin.

As you tend to your tiny garden, other survivors begin to appear. They're drawn by the impossible sight of green shoots pushing through the cracked concrete. What started as an act of quiet defiance becomes something larger—a beacon of possibility in a world that had forgotten how to hope.

The garden grows slowly, but it grows. And with it, something essential that the apocalypse had nearly destroyed: the simple human belief that tomorrow might be better than today.
