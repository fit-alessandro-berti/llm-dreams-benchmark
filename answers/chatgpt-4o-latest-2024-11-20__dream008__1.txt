...feel a sense of rising panic because you have no idea how you're going to make this happen. The clock on the wall seems to tick faster than normal, and the fluorescent lights flicker ominously. You sit at your desk, staring at the blank screen in front of you, when suddenly, the computer monitor transforms into a swirling vortex. Before you can react, the vortex begins to pull you in. 

Your surroundings blur and shift, and the sensation of falling overwhelms you. When you regain focus, you find yourself not at your desk, but in a strange, surreal version of your workplace. Everything is slightly off—your coworkers have elongated limbs, the walls are an impossible shade of green, and the air smells faintly of fresh-baked cookies. In the corner of the room stands a towering clock, its hands spinning wildly in all directions.

Your boss approaches you, but instead of speaking, they hand you a glowing puzzle piece. Oddly, you feel like you understand what to do. You turn to the swirling mass of light in the center of the room—a massive metaphorical representation of the "project" you’re supposed to complete. As you fit the puzzle piece into the mass, it shifts and morphs—but it doesn't solve.

Your coworkers begin to chant a nonsensical phrase. You don't understand the words, but somehow, they fill you with determination. You search the dream-office for more puzzle pieces, uncovering them in strange places—beneath the stapler, inside a coworker’s coffee mug, even in the folds of your own shirt. Each piece brings the swirling project closer to completion, but you notice the deadline clock ticking louder and louder.

Just as you’re about to find the final piece, a massive shadow looms over you. You turn around and see your boss, now ten feet tall, pointing at the clock. "TIME'S UP!" they boom. Panic surges through you, but in a moment of clarity, you realize it's just a dream. "I control this," you say, and with a wave of your hand, the shadowy figure shrinks. The clock freezes, and the final puzzle piece appears in your palm.

As you place the last piece, the swirling mass of light bursts into a brilliant display of color, and everything around you dissolves into calm. You wake up feeling strangely empowered.
