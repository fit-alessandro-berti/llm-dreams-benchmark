As you weave through the crowd, laughter and snippets of conversation swirl around you like a gentle current. The room is bright and airy, filled with the warm glow of string lights and the hum of distant music. You pause near a buffet table, scanning the sea of faces, hoping to catch a familiar smile.

A group of strangers, animated and friendly, invite you to join their circle. You hesitate, feeling like an outsider, but their enthusiasm is infectious. You nod, and as you try to contribute to the conversation, your words come out in a jumble of half-formed thoughts and forgotten names. The group laughs kindly, and someone hands you a drink—some kind of fruit punch that tastes faintly of childhood summers.

Suddenly, you spot them across the room: your only acquaintance, waving to get your attention. Relief floods through you. As you make your way over, the crowd parts like a curtain, and the noise fades into a soft background murmur. You reach them just as the music shifts to a slower, more soulful tune.

Together, you stand on the edge of the dance floor, unsure of what to say at first. But the shared relief, the unspoken understanding of being strangers in a strange land, brings you closer. You laugh about the awkward encounters, the strange dream logic that guided your steps, and for a moment, the entire gathering blurs into a tapestry of fleeting connections—all centered around the one person you came to find.

And as the dream begins to fade, you realize that even in a crowd of strangers, you were never truly alone.
