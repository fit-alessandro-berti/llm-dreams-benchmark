...and you realize they all share the same quiet smile, the kind that knows your name without asking. One of them—a woman in a coat the color of forgotten afternoons—unfurls a map made of silk and starlight. The streets on it keep rearranging themselves, but she points to a corner that pulses like a heartbeat.

"Where you need to be isn't a place," she says, her voice like wind chimes in a distant courtyard. "It's a when."

The group surrounds you, linking arms to form a circle. They begin humming, and the sound becomes a physical thing—soft as moss, strong as roots. The city around you blurs into watercolor smudges. You feel the ground tilt gently, not to drop you, but to tip you toward something.

A small door materializes in the concrete wall beside you, no taller than your knee. The woman hands you a key shaped like a question mark. When you crouch to unlock it, your fingers pass through the door as if it's made of memory. You look back at the strangers, but they're already dissolving into the crowd, each one leaving behind a single feather that drifts upward against the wind.

You step through the door—not with your body, but with the part of you that was lost. On the other side is the same city street, but now you can read the graffiti: *"You were never alone. You were just between words in a sentence the universe was still writing."*

The bus stop ahead glows like a lantern. Your reflection in its glass shows all the strangers' faces layered behind your own, smiling.
