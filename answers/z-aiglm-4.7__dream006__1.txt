...speak. You open your mouth to say "Hello," but instead of words, a stream of vibrant, multicolored confetti pours out. The crowd gasps, not in horror, but in delight. They stand up in unison, reaching their hands into the air to catch the paper scraps as if they were snowflakes.

You look down at your hands to check your notes, only to realize your hands are made of glass and you can see the gears ticking inside your wrists. You try to turn the page of your speech, but your glass fingers slip right through the paper. The microphone begins to melt like chocolate, dripping onto the stage floor where it instantly forms a small, winding river. You step into it, and the current pulls you gently away, floating you down the center aisle while the audience applauds wildly, their hands clapping in a rhythm that matches the beating of your own heart.
