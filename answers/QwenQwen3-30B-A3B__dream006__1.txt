You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak—but your voice emerges as a cascade of overlapping whispers, each word dissolving into a different language. The audience tilts their heads, their faces shifting like melting wax, some grinning with too many teeth, others weeping silent tears. You try to regain control, but your hands are now feathered, and the podium has grown roots, anchoring you to the stage. The crowd’s murmurs coalesce into a single phrase: *“Say it again, but *true*.”* You open your mouth, but no sound comes—only a flock of birds erupts from your throat, scattering into the darkened hall. As they spiral upward, the ceiling peels back to reveal a sky of swirling constellations, each star a tiny, watching eye. You realize, with a jolt of surreal clarity, that the audience isn’t human at all—they’re reflections of your own unspoken fears, and the speech you’ve been trying to give is the one you’ve never dared to utter aloud. The birds circle, waiting. What do you say?
