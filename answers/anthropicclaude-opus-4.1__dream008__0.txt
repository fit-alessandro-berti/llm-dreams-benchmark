*...you look down at your hands and they're translucent, flickering like old computer screens. The keyboard in front of you starts melting into silver liquid that flows upward, defying gravity.*

Your boss is waiting, but when you look up, they've multiplied into seven identical copies, all speaking in perfect unison but saying different things. Their words taste like colors in the air - purple anxiety, chartreuse urgency.

You try to explain that you need more time, but instead of words, soap bubbles float from your mouth. Each bubble contains a tiny version of yourself, frantically working on the project. They pop against the ceiling, which has become a starry sky.

The deadline isn't just impossible - it's literally written as "Yesterday's Tomorrow" on a clock that's running backward. You reach for your computer mouse but it transforms into an actual mouse that whispers the solution to everything, except it's speaking in a language that sounds like rain on windows.

Suddenly you realize you can fly, so obviously that's the answer. You float through the office wall, which parts like a curtain made of water, and on the other side...

*...the dream shifts, as dreams do...*
