take a deep breath, trying to steady your emotions. The world around you shifts slightly—colors seem more saturated, the air heavier. Your friend’s voice echoes strangely, as if bouncing off unseen walls.

“I can’t believe you don’t see it my way,” they say, frustration laced in their tone. Their eyes flicker between anger and something deeper—maybe hurt, maybe fear.

You try to respond, but the words come out like smoke, dissolving before they reach them. Your hands feel weightless. Suddenly, the ground beneath you softens, tilting ever so slightly, as if you’re standing on the surface of a giant, slow-moving wave.

Then— **a pause.**  

Both of you notice it at the same time.  

The world is no longer the same.  

The room around you fades into something else entirely—a vast, open space filled with floating objects, fragments of memories, whispers of past conversations drifting like mist. Your friend is still there, but their form wavers, as if they are made of glass reflecting too many different realities at once.

A single door stands in the distance, pulsing with light. The argument feels suddenly unimportant compared to the mystery before you.  

Do you continue arguing? Do you reach for the door? Or do you turn to your friend and ask, **"Are we dreaming?"**
