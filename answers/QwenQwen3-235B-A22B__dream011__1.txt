**You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are** written in a shimmering, silver ink that flickers like fireflies. Each word seems to vibrate, morphing into cryptic symbols that rearrange themselves the moment you try to focus. Question one asks, *"What does the crow weigh when it stands on one leg?"* beneath a sketch of a clock melting into sand.  

As you pick up your pen, the paper dissolves into a glassy surface reflecting fragmented memories: a childhood failure, a whispered apology you never heard, a door you’ve always been too afraid to open. The proctor—a figure with your own face, but older, wearier—leans over and murmurs, *"Answer honestly, but choose which truth to kill."*  

The walls begin to pulse like a heartbeat. Answers materialize as shadows crawling across the desk, each one a different version of yourself: a doctor, a wanderer, a ghost of who you might have been. To mark your choice, you must swallow the corresponding shadow whole.  

Outside the window, the sky splits into a kaleidoscope of futures, each hue a career path unraveling in real time. You realize the exam isn’t testing knowledge—it’s a sieve for the soul, and the timer is your own racing breath.  

You blink. The first question vanishes, replaced by a single word: *"Forgive."*  

Your pen begins to bleed.
