As you drift between clusters of strangers, each group seems to have its own atmosphere, like tiny worlds spiraling within the larger gathering. One cluster is laughing explosively at something you didn’t hear, their joy so strong it almost pulls you in. Another group speaks in hushed tones, their words indistinct yet oddly magnetic, like secrets you almost remember.  

You scan the crowd for the one familiar face, but the faces seem to blur and shift the more you look. Some people wear masks made of mirrored glass; others seem to flicker, as if they’re only half-present. You realize you’re not entirely sure what your friend looks like anymore—whether you’d recognize them as they are in this dream.  

A tall figure waves at you from across the room, their gesture clear and deliberate. For a moment you believe it must be your friend—but as you move closer, you see they aren’t waving you over at all. They’re conducting something. Your gaze shifts upward, and you notice the ceiling has vanished, replaced with a night sky heavy with stars. The groups around you begin to hum, subtly at first, then gaining harmony, as if this were all rehearsed.  

You stand at the edge between the gathering and the infinite sky stretching beyond, realizing you have a choice: remain searching for the one you know, or step fully into the strange collective rhythm that is even now gathering around you.  

Do you want me to continue the dream in a surreal direction, make it feel more like a comforting lucid dream, or push it toward something eerie and uncanny?
