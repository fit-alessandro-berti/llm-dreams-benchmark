You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak. Your voice booms, amplified beyond reason, each word shimmering into golden script that floats upward like smoke. The audience leans in, their faces a sea of blurred features, eyes glowing with anticipation. 

But as you continue, the stage beneath your feet softens, the edges of the room dissolving into mist. Your words—now about courage, about change—stir the air like a spell. The ceiling peels away, revealing a sky streaked with auroras. The chairs vanish, replaced by swaying trees; the crowd becomes a murmuring forest, leaves rustling in time with your speech. 

You realize you’re no longer holding a microphone but a flaming torch, its light painting the world as you speak it into being. The dream bends, and for a moment, you’re no longer afraid—you are the dreamer and the dream, the speaker and the shaper. The audience sighs like wind through branches, and you wake just as the first dawn breaks in your imagined sky.
