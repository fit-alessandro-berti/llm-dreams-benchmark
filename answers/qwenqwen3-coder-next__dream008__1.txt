You’re standing in the open-plan office—fluorescent lights humming overhead, the scent of stale coffee and printer toner thick in the air—when your boss, Ms. Thorne, appears beside your desk, clutching a single sheet of paper like a sacred relic. Her voice is calm, but her eyes hold the sharp gleam of someone who’s already resigned herself to inevitable chaos.

> **“Project Chimera,”** she says. **“ Launch in 47 minutes. Global client presentation. The spec sheet’s attached.”**

You take the paper. It’s blank.

Not empty. Not tear-stained. Not a typo. *Blank.* You turn it over. Blank. Shake it. Nothing. You squint at the surface—under the harsh light, faint geometric lines shimmer, like code written in invisible ink, but vanish the moment you blink.

Ms. Thorne tilts her head. “Go on. Start.”

Your hands hover over your keyboard. You type: *“Client: nonexistent. Deliverable: undefined. Deadline: 47:00…”* The cursor blinks. Then, the screen flickers—not black, but *translucent*. Suddenly, you’re no longer in the office. You’re standing on a rain-slicked rooftop at twilight, city lights smearing into constellations below. The wind carries the scent of ozone and warm bread.

A man in a worn trench coat approaches. He offers you a steaming paper cup—no handle, just folded ridges—and says, voice like gravel under tires:  
> **“You can’t build it. You have to *find* it. Every project is a dream you haven’t remembered yet.”**

He gestures toward the skyline. Among the buildings, one flickers—intermittent, like a faulty filament—its windows rearranging themselves into nested fractals: towers inside towers, staircases spiraling into themselves, staircases leading *outward* into sky.

The cup warms your palms. Inside, the coffee is clear water… but when you sip it, you taste your childhood nickname, spoken by your grandmother.

You look down at your hands. They’re holding not a coffee cup, but a small, smooth river stone. Etched into its surface: **47:00**. And beneath it, three symbols you recognize from old dreams: a key, an open book, and a door with no handle.

The boss’s voice echoes, distant now:  
> **“The deadline doesn’t matter if you’re not in time.”**

You close your eyes.

When you open them again, you’re back at your desk. The screen glows softly. A new tab is open—no URL, just one word, written in your own handwriting, but you swear you’ve never typed it:

> **begin?**

The clock on your monitor reads:  
**00:46:59**

You reach for the mouse.

What do you click?

*(Your move, dreamer.)*
