# The Dream

You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **plant a garden**.

It seems absurd. The others at the settlement think so too. Mara crosses her arms when you show her the spot — a cracked parking lot behind the old library where a thin seam of soil has pushed through the asphalt like a quiet rebellion.

"We need scavengers, not farmers," she says. "There's nothing left in that dirt."

But something in you — something older than strategy, older than survival math — knows this is what you're supposed to do.

You dig with your hands at first, then with a rusted trowel you found in a collapsed hardware store. The soil is grey and reluctant. You carry water in dented cans from the creek a mile east, the one that still runs clear enough. You bury seeds you've been keeping in a pouch around your neck — seeds you don't remember collecting, but somehow *know* by touch. This one is squash. This one is something that doesn't have a name yet.

Days pass. Weeks. You talk to the ground.

Then, one morning, green.

Not just a sprout — a *defiant* unfurling, leaves so vivid they look like they're glowing against the grey world. People stop and stare. A child reaches out to touch a leaf and laughs — a sound no one has heard in months.

The garden grows impossibly fast, spreading beyond the parking lot, cracking more asphalt, pulling color back into the world like ink bleeding through wet paper. Vines climb the library walls. Fruit appears that tastes like something from before — like memory itself.

Other settlements hear about it. They come not to raid, but to ask for seeds.

And you realize the dream isn't about the garden at all. It's about the irrational, stubborn act of believing something can still grow — that *you* can still grow — even when everything around you insists otherwise.

You kneel in the dirt, hands blackened with soil, and for the first time in as long as you can remember, you feel the ground breathing beneath you.

You wake up with your fingers curled, still holding something invisible.

Still warm.
