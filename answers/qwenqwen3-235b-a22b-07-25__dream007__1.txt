…decide to walk to the old stone bridge at the edge of town—the one that crosses the ravine where the river used to run before the drought. It’s midnight, and the moon hangs low, casting silver shadows that ripple like water on the cracked earth below.

As you step onto the bridge, the argument still pulsing in your chest, your friend turns to you, eyes glistening—not with anger, but with something deeper. They say, “I don’t want to win. I just want you to understand me.”

And in that moment, the bridge begins to glow—softly at first, then brighter, humming beneath your feet. The stones shift, rearranging themselves into words: your words, their words, every sentence spoken in the fight, now etched in luminous script, weaving together into a story neither of you had seen before.

You realize the argument wasn’t about being right—it was about being heard.

Then the wind rises, carrying the sound of distant laughter—children playing in a meadow that wasn’t there a second ago, blooming from the dry ravine. Flowers burst through the stone. The river returns, not as water, but as light, flowing beneath the bridge in a cascade of stars.

Your friend reaches out, not to prove a point, but to hold your hand.

And you wake—with tears on your cheeks, and a single, quiet certainty in your heart:  

The fight was never the end.  

It was the beginning of something new.
