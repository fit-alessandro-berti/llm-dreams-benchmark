feel your heart racing. You glance at your desk, and suddenly, the papers start multiplying and piling up, each document becoming thicker and heavier than before. As anxiety rises, you try to organize your thoughts, but the clock begins spinning wildly out of control.

Then, strangely, the room around you begins changing. The walls melt away into a vast, open meadow beneath a gentle twilight sky. Your panic quickly subsides as gentle breezes brush your face, calming your heart. The previously impossible piles of work dissipate into a handful of glowing fireflies that lift upward, carrying away your worries.

Your boss smiles gently, transforming into a friendly companion who says reassuringly: "Sometimes the impossible isn't so hard after all." You find that you have wings, warm and vibrant, slowly unfolding from your back. You soar effortlessly into the calming night sky, feeling liberated and free. Far below, you see the meadow softly illuminated, revealing pathways you hadn't noticed before. Somehow, deep within, you understand: everything you feared is resolved, and everything is within your grasp.
