You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you gratefully accept, following them through neon-lit alleys alive with the hum of street vendors and distant jazz. Their faces shimmer like mirages—smiling, ethereal, one with eyes like polished obsidian, another with hair flowing like liquid starlight.

They lead you to a hidden rooftop garden, where the city sprawls below like a glowing neural network. "This is the heart of it all," the leader whispers, handing you a glowing key etched with forgotten runes. As you turn it in an invisible lock, the skyline warps: skyscrapers twist into colossal trees, streets become rivers of light, and the strangers reveal themselves as luminous guardians of the dream-realm.

But doubt creeps in—you realize the key is pulling *you* into the city, not guiding you out. The strangers' smiles widen, their forms elongating into shadows. "Stay," they chorus. "The waking world is the real lost place." You hesitate, heart pounding, then shatter the key against the rooftop edge. Reality fractures—colors bleed into void—and you plummet awake, tangled in sheets, the city's echo lingering in your pulse.

What happens next in the dream? Or do you wake fully?
