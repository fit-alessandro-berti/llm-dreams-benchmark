…seek out a community rumored to exist beyond the shattered city limits, hoping for safety and maybe even a new beginning. The sky is a restless swirl of ash and faded sunlight as you wrap a worn scarf tighter around your face and gather your meager supplies—a battered flashlight, a half-empty water bottle, and an old photograph of someone you can barely remember.

Every step crunches on broken glass and twisted metal. The silence is uneasy, punctuated by distant echoes—maybe the wind, maybe not. You remind yourself to stay alert.

Along the way, you spot a tattered sign half-buried in rubble: **"Haven, 5 miles."** The name stirs a cautious hope in your chest. Not far now.

Your path takes you through a deserted playground, rusted swings groaning in the breeze. You pause. In the sand under the slide, you notice a glint of metal. Curiosity and caution war within you, but ultimately, you dig it out. A sturdy folding knife—small comfort in a dangerous world.

As dusk falls, you find shelter in the shell of an old diner. While scavenging the kitchen for anything edible, you hear hurried footsteps outside. Heart racing, you duck behind the counter, clutching your new knife.

A shadow passes by the fogged window; a muffled voice calls out, "Hello? I saw your light—is someone there? I swear, I’m not looking for trouble..."

You have a choice: confront the stranger, hide and hope they move on, or sneak out the back to avoid any risk. The world is uncertain, but hope, it seems, is not yet dead—nor is the chance to find a companion on the journey ahead.
