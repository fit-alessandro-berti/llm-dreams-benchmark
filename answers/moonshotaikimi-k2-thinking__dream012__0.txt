...stand at the helm, and realize the wheel is made of paper. It dissolves in your hands, wet with rain that tastes like iron. The crew's faces keep sliding sideways, becoming the faces of people you've forgotten—your third grade teacher, the man who sold you coffee yesterday, your mother at different ages all at once.

"Steer by memory," someone shouts, but the memory is of a song you never learned. You sing it anyway. The notes become ropes that lash themselves to the mast, which is also a lamppost from a street you lived on in a city that doesn't exist.

The sea isn't water anymore. It's made of all the unsent letters you've ever written, and they're folding themselves into origami birds that dive beneath the hull. Each time one disappears, you feel lighter, as if you're the one being emptied.

The crew is chanting the names of constellations that have never been mapped. You look up and see the stars are just holes in a dark cloth, and behind it—something bright and terrible is watching.

You wake up. But in the dream, you don't wake up. Instead, the storm becomes a blanket, and you pull it over the ship like tucking in a child. The crew smiles with too many teeth. They say: "Now we can finally begin."

And the ship sails downward, into the soft earth, leaving no wake at all.
