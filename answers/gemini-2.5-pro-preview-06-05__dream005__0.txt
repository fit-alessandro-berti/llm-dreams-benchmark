...and find that each group is locked in its own bizarre, silent world.

The first group you approach is clustered around a tall, ornate fountain, but the fountain spouts not water, but thick, shimmering sand. The people, all dressed in formal wear made of crinkled tin foil, are catching the sand in crystal goblets. As they "drink," their faces remain placid, their eyes distant. You try to ask one of them, a woman with a rustling silver dress, if she's seen your friend, Sam. She simply turns her head slowly, opens her mouth, and a fine stream of golden sand pours out, forming a small, perfect pyramid on the marble floor. She offers you no other acknowledgement.

You back away, the quiet hiss of falling sand filling your ears, and move toward a corner of the grand ballroom. Here, a group of old men with magnificent, cloud-like beards are playing chess. The oddity, you realize, is that their chess pieces are miniature, sleeping animals. A tiny, curled-up fox is a knight, a slumbering bear is a rook, a dozing songbird is a pawn. They move the pieces with incredible gentleness, nudging them across the board without waking them. The game seems to have no end, no strategy you can discern. Their concentration is absolute, a silent pact to protect the creatures' sleep. When you try to catch one's eye, he simply puts a finger to his lips, his gaze flicking down to a miniature hedgehog—his queen—with profound tenderness.

A thread of familiar music pulls you toward a curtained alcove. Peeking inside, you find a small group of people humming. They aren't humming a tune, but the *feeling* of a color. A woman in a deep blue velvet dress hums a low, resonant note that feels like twilight. A man beside her hums a sharp, staccato series of notes that prickle your skin like the color yellow. They are building a silent orchestra of hues. You feel the deep, rolling vibration of purple and the light, airy trill of pale green. You try to hum the color of Sam's favorite sweater—a warm, faded orange—but your note comes out grey and formless, and the group shies away from the dissonance.

Feeling lost and increasingly alone, you see a single figure standing by a vast window, looking out not at a city or a garden, but a swirling nebula of stars.

It's Sam.

You rush over, relief washing through you. "Sam! I've been looking everywhere for you. This place is so strange."

Sam turns, and their face is calm and familiar, a lighthouse in this sea of madness. They smile, but it's a sad, knowing smile.

"I know," Sam says, their voice the only normal sound you've heard all night. "I'm sorry. I should have told you."

"Told me what? What is this place?"

Sam gestures to the swirling cosmos outside the window. "Every night, we have to rebuild it. Each of us." They then point back to the room. "The Sand-Drinkers are filling the hourglasses of time. The Chess-Players are putting the wild things to rest. The Hummers are weaving the colors of the dawn."

Your heart sinks. "And... and you?"

Sam turns back to the window, and you see now that they are holding a single, impossibly bright star in their cupped hands.

"I have to put the stars back in their places," Sam whispers, a tear rolling down their cheek and turning into stardust as it falls. "And I'm so, so tired. I was hoping you'd find me."

Sam offers you the star. It's warm, and it pulses with a gentle, living light.

"Will you help me?"

The dream holds its breath, waiting for your answer. The weight of the star feels both impossibly heavy and lighter than air. The quiet hum of the universe fills the silence between you.
