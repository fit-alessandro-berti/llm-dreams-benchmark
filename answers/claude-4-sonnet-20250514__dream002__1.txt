...the air grows thick and electric. The peaceful birdsong cuts off abruptly, leaving an eerie silence broken only by the first rumbles of distant thunder. The canopy above, which moments before filtered gentle sunlight, now churns with shadows as dark clouds swirl impossibly fast overhead.

I quicken my pace, searching for shelter, but the forest path begins to shift beneath my feet. The trees seem taller now, their branches reaching down like gnarled fingers. A flash of lightning illuminates the woods in stark black and white, and in that brief moment, I glimpse something moving between the trunks—not quite animal, not quite human.

The wind picks up, howling through the leaves with an almost musical quality, like whispered voices I can't quite understand. My clothes whip around me as I break into a run, following what I hope is still the path, though the familiar landmarks have somehow changed. That old oak tree now has a face in its bark, watching me with ancient, knowing eyes.

Just as the first heavy raindrops begin to fall, I spot a warm glow ahead—a small cottage that definitely wasn't there when I entered the forest. Smoke rises from its chimney, and through the windows, I can see the flickering dance of firelight. As I reach for the door handle, I wonder if I'm seeking shelter... or if the storm was guiding me here all along.
