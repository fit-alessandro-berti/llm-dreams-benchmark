...the sky doesn't simply darken; it turns a vibrant, bruising shade of violet. The clouds stop moving and solidify, looking like heavy sculptures of marble hanging precariously above the treetops.

The wind picks up, but instead of rushing air, it feels like a tide of warm water pushing against your skin, even though you are dry. The trees around you begin to unroot themselves, lifting their trunks like skirts to tiptoe away from the coming thunder.

You try to run, but your legs feel heavy, as if you are wading through molasses. A single drop of rain hits your cheek—it doesn't splash, but shatters like a tiny glass bead, ringing with a musical note. Suddenly, the "rain" begins falling in earnest, millions of colorful glass beads chiming against the moss.

Desperate for shelter, you spot a small wooden door standing freely in the middle of a clearing, attached to nothing. You wrench it open and dive through.

Inside, it is not a room, but the backseat of a moving taxi driving through underwater tunnels. The driver turns around—it is a large, tuxedo-wearing owl. He looks at you with golden eyes and says, "You're late. The storm only waits for the tea to steep."

You look down at your hands and realize you are holding a teacup that contains the entire galaxy swirling in the dark liquid. You take a sip, and wake up.
