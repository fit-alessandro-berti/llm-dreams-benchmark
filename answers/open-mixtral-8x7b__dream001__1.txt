panic, quickly looking around for any familiar landmarks or street signs. Your heart races as you try to remember any details about the location of the meeting, but your mind draws a blank.

Suddenly, you hear a faint buzzing sound and notice a small, metallic creature flying towards you. As it gets closer, you realize it's a tiny drone equipped with a holographic display. The drone projects a map onto the air in front of you, highlighting a route to the meeting location.

Relieved, you start to follow the map, weaving through the crowded streets and taking in the strange sights and sounds of the city. The architecture is unlike anything you've ever seen before, with towering spires and intricate patterns etched into every surface.

As you approach the meeting location, you notice a group of people gathered outside, chatting and laughing. You feel a sense of familiarity wash over you, and you realize that you know some of these people after all.

You join the group, exchanging pleasantries and making small talk as you wait for the meeting to begin. The sun begins to set, casting a warm glow over the city, and you can't help but feel grateful for this unexpected adventure.
