...a blank canvas and an overwhelming urge, not to paint, but to *listen* to it.

The air around the canvas hums, a low thrumming that vibrates in my chest. The constantly shifting colors of the world – now a riot of neon greens and pulsating violets, now a soft wash of pearlescent blues and silvers – seem to *hesitate* around the canvas, as if respecting its silence.

I lean closer. The blankness isn't empty; it's pregnant, like a held breath. Then, a single, pure white shape begins to emerge from its center. Not painted, but *growing*, like a crystal. It's impossibly sharp-edged, yet it flows like liquid mercury. As it expands, it doesn't push the colors away but seems to *absorb* their essence, turning them into pure, silent light within its own form.

The shape continues to morph – a perfect sphere, then a spiraling galaxy of light, then a complex, impossible knot that ties and unties itself with serene grace. Each transformation sends a corresponding shift through *me*. When it's a sphere, I feel a sense of wholeness and calm. When it's the galaxy, a dizzying wonder. The knot brings a confusing tangle of emotions that resolve into a strange peace as it untangles.

Suddenly, the shape flattens, becoming a perfect mirror. But it doesn't reflect the chaotic, colorful world around me. Instead, it reflects a single, steady, unwavering point of brilliant, warm light, like a distant star. And in that reflection, for a fleeting moment, I see myself, not as I am, but as a silhouette bathed in that starlight, utterly still and serene amidst the swirling dream.

Then, the canvas begins to ripple like water, the image of the star distorting, and the familiar, ever-changing colors of the dream-world start to bleed back onto its surface, washing over the white shape until it's submerged once more, leaving the canvas blank, humming softly, waiting. And I feel a profound sense of having witnessed something ancient and fundamental, a truth just beyond my waking grasp.
