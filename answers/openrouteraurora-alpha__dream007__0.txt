You decide to step away from the shouting and the clenched fists, and instead **walk through the argument like it were a hallway made of glass**. The walls pulse with a soft, amber light, and every footfall sends ripples of color down the floor—emeralds, sapphire blues, and warm amber—like a living kaleidoscope. 

Your friend follows, the tension in their shoulders loosening as the world around you transforms. The hallway widens into a sprawling garden that seems to have sprouted from the very thoughts you’re wrestling with. **Trees of memory** line the path, their leaves shaped like tiny photographs of moments you’ve shared: the night you camped under a sky of fireworks, the quiet mornings with coffee and a shared notebook, the arguments that always ended in laughter. 

In the center of the garden stands a **mirror pond**, its surface perfectly still despite the storm of words that just passed. You both kneel at its edge, and as you look into the water, the reflection isn’t your faces—it’s a **pair of hands reaching out to each other**, fingers interlaced, glowing faintly with a golden hue. 

A gentle voice, neither yours nor your friend’s, whispers from the breeze: “The truth you both seek isn’t a single answer, but the space between you.” The wind lifts a handful of **luminescent petals**—each petal a fragment of the disagreement— and carries them away, scattering them across the sky where they dissolve into stars.

You turn to your friend, and instead of shouting, you **offer a small, simple stone** that you found on the garden path. It’s smooth, warm, and feels like a promise. Your friend takes it, nods, and places it beside the pond. In that moment, the argument dissolves, not because it’s solved, but because you’ve both chosen to **listen to the silence that follows**, letting the dream’s soft light fill the space where anger once lived. 

The garden fades, the glass hallway reforms, and you find yourselves back in the room where the argument began—only now, the air feels lighter, the words feel softer, and the friendship feels like a **new chapter waiting to be written**, one where the dream’s colors linger in the corners of your mind, reminding you that even the fiercest disputes can become the most beautiful scenery when you decide to step into the dream together.
