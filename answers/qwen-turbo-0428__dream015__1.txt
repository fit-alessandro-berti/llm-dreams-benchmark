You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to build a sanctuary—a place where others can survive, heal, and maybe even thrive again. You scavenge through the ruins of a forgotten city, searching for materials, seeds, and knowledge. You find a hidden underground bunker filled with old books, tools, and a functioning hydroponic system. It's not much, but it's a start.

As days turn into weeks, people begin to find their way to your sanctuary. Some are survivors like you, others are lost souls seeking hope. You teach them how to grow food, fix machines, and defend against the creatures that roam the wasteland. You name the place "Elysium," a small flicker of light in the darkness.

But not everyone is friendly. A ruthless warlord, known as the Iron Hand, hears of your sanctuary and sees it as a threat. He sends his men to take over, to control the last remnants of civilization. You must choose: fight back, flee, or find another way to protect what you've built.

In your dream, you stand at the edge of Elysium, looking out at the horizon. The sun is setting, casting golden light over the ruins. You feel a mix of fear and determination. You know the road ahead will be dangerous, but you also know that as long as there is hope, there is a chance to rebuild.

What do you do next?
