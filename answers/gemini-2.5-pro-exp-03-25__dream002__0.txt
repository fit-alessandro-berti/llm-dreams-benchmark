... you feel a storm approaching **and the air crackles with an unnatural energy.** The sunlight, moments ago dappling warmly through the leaves, vanishes as if swallowed whole. The sky bruises, turning an unnatural shade of deep violet and churning green.

The wind whips through the branches, not just rustling leaves but *shrieking*, tearing them away in frantic spirals that dance like angry spirits. An unnatural chill bites through your clothes, raising goosebumps despite the sudden exertion you feel compelling you forward. You need shelter.

Your eyes dart around, searching for cover. Where there was only dense undergrowth a moment ago, you now see the dark maw of a cave, half-hidden by pulsating, faintly glowing fungi clinging to the rock face. It wasn't there before, you're sure of it, but the urgency overrides the strangeness.

Thunder cracks overhead, but it doesn't just rumble; it echoes with a low, resonant *hum* that vibrates deep in your chest, almost like a voice trying to form words you can't quite understand.

You plunge into the darkness, the roar of the storm abruptly muffled, replaced by the echoing drip of water and the thrumming beat of your own heart in the sudden, profound silence. The cave mouth seems to shrink behind you, the pulsing fungi casting one last, strange glow before you are swallowed by the deep, waiting blackness...
