…and you say yes before you can talk yourself out of it.

One of them—a woman in a yellow coat—steps forward and smiles like she’s known you for years. “Where are you trying to go?” she asks.

You open your mouth to answer, but realize you don’t actually know. You only have a feeling: somewhere quieter, softer, somewhere that doesn’t hum with this constant electric ache. You shrug helplessly.

“That’s okay,” says a tall man with ink on his fingers, like he’s just put down a pen. “We can start with what you *don’t* want.”

They form a loose circle around you, blocking the rush of bodies that streams past. The city noise dims, like someone is slowly turning a dial down. Shop signs blur, traffic lights soften. A woman with headphones pulls one earbud out and hands it to you. “Here,” she says, “it helps me remember I’m not alone.” You hear music, but in the dream it’s not a song—it’s the sound of overlapping conversations you’ve had with everyone who ever cared about you, all stitched together into something warm.

The group begins to walk, and you move with them.

You pass a glass-front café, and in the reflection you notice something strange: the faces of the strangers shift. For a moment, the woman in the yellow coat looks like an old friend you lost touch with. The man with ink on his fingers looks like your father when he was younger. Another stranger briefly becomes a teacher who once believed in you, then a sibling, then someone you haven’t met yet but somehow already miss.

You blink. The reflections settle back into the faces of strangers. No one seems to notice except you.

“Do you recognize it yet?” asks the woman in the yellow coat.

“Recognize what?” you say.

“Any of this.” She gestures around: the street, the crowd, the sky, your own hands.

You look up. The skyscrapers curve in impossible ways, bending toward each other like trees leaning in to gossip. Windows flicker not with lights, but with tiny scenes: you trying something new, you failing, you laughing anyway, you leaving places that hurt, you arriving somewhere you didn’t know you needed. Every window is a version of you going somewhere, even when you thought you were stuck.

A stranger with freckles and a chipped tooth points ahead. “There,” they say.

At the end of the street, instead of another intersection, there’s a small doorway between two buildings that you’re sure wasn’t there before. It’s simple and unremarkable, but looking at it fills you with the same feeling as remembering a word that’s been on the tip of your tongue all day.

“That’s where you’re going,” says the man with ink on his fingers.

“What’s inside?” you ask.

They all smile, the same knowing, gentle smile.

“We don’t get to open it for you,” the woman in the yellow coat says. “We’re just here to walk with you until you’re ready to try the handle.”

You stand in front of the door. The city behind you hums, but it doesn’t feel hostile anymore—just busy, just alive. You realize you can still feel the strangers beside you, even though you’re facing away from them. Their presence sits on your shoulders like a soft jacket.

You take a breath that feels deeper than the others. Your hand rises, almost on its own, and settles on the doorknob. It’s warm, like someone else’s hand was there just moments before.

“Even if you lose us in the crowd later,” one of them says behind you, “you’ll know how this feels. You can always find this again.”

You nod, though you’re not sure how. The dream doesn’t explain. It never does.

You turn the knob.

On the other side, there isn’t a room or a street—just a wash of soft light and a quiet that isn’t empty but *open*, like blank pages. For a heartbeat you’re afraid. Then you feel it: not certainty, but a small, steady willingness.

You step through.

As you do, the strangers’ voices blur into the city’s heartbeat, and the last thought you have before the dream begins to dissolve is that you weren’t really lost—you were just between chapters, wandering the margins, waiting for the courage to write the next line.
