It seems like an intriguing start to a dream narrative! Here’s a completion of your dream that explores the tension, surrealism, and resolution often found in such scenarios:

**...unlike anything you’ve studied.** The paper is blank except for a single line at the top: *“Define your purpose in three sentences. No corrections allowed.”*  

Your pencil hovers. The clock ticks louder. Around you, classmates scribble furiously, but their faces are blurred, as if erased by rain. You realize you’ve never seen this room before—the walls are lined with flickering candles instead of fluorescent lights, and the chairs are antique, their wooden arms carved with symbols you can’t decipher.  

A professor’s voice booms from nowhere: *“Time begins… now.”*  

You write the first sentence: *“I want to help people.”* The ink glows faintly blue. The second sentence comes easier: *“I want to understand why things fall apart.”* The glow intensifies, casting shadows on the page.  

But the third sentence freezes you. The candles gutter, and the room tilts. A draft whispers, *“Or do you want to be remembered?”*  

You glance up. The other students are gone. Only you remain, sitting at a desk that now resembles a confession booth. The blank paper stares back.  

Finally, you scribble: *“I want to choose, not be chosen.”*  

The glow flares white. The exam paper dissolves into a flock of origami cranes that swirl around you, their wings whispering, *“Pass. But the real test begins tomorrow.”*  

You wake up with the taste of parchment on your tongue, your pillow damp with sweat—and a text alert on your phone: *“Interview scheduled for 9 AM. Dress professionally.”*

**Themes**: Identity, pressure, and the blur between dreams and reality. The dream mirrors the anxiety of high-stakes decisions while subtly suggesting that the “exam” is less about knowledge and more about self-awareness. What do you think? Would you tweak any details?
