# The Dream Job Competition

...and the challenges seem to shift and morph like water finding new shapes.

---

The first challenge arrives in a room made entirely of **clocks** — thousands of them, all ticking at different rhythms. A voice from somewhere above the ceiling announces:

*"You have exactly as much time as you believe you have."*

I look around at the other competitors. Some are panicking, checking their watches. Some freeze entirely. I close my eyes and just... **breathe**. When I open them, the clocks have all gone quiet and a door has appeared in the far wall. I walk through it.

---

The second room is filled with **my own handwriting** — but it's every doubt I've ever written down. Every journal entry that started with *"I don't think I'm good enough."* They're pinned to the walls like butterflies in a museum case.

A judge I don't recognize says, *"Refute one. Just one."*

I walk slowly along the wall. My finger stops on a yellowed piece of paper that reads: *"Nobody will ever take me seriously."*

I turn around and say, quietly but without hesitation:

**"Someone already has. I take myself seriously now. That's the only credential that was ever missing."**

The paper dissolves. The room brightens.

---

The third challenge is the strangest.

There are no tasks. No judges. No other competitors visible anywhere. Just a long wooden table, and sitting at it is a version of **me** — maybe ten years older, maybe ten years more tired, but with remarkably calm eyes.

*"Sit down,"* they say.

I sit.

*"Tell me why you want this,"* older-me says. *"And don't give me the answer you rehearsed."*

The rehearsed answer bubbles up reflexively — the one about passion, about impact, about following a calling. I almost say it. But something about looking at my own eyes across a table makes the rehearsed words feel like costumes.

So instead I say something I haven't admitted to anyone:

*"Because there's a version of an ordinary Tuesday — not a big achievement day, just a random Tuesday — where I wake up and the thing I'm going to spend the day doing feels like* mine. *Not borrowed. Not performed. Mine. I want that Tuesday. I've been chasing that Tuesday for a long time."*

Older-me smiles. Not a triumphant smile. A **recognizing** smile.

*"That's the right answer,"* they say. *"That was always the right answer."*

---

And then the competition hall fills with light, warm and golden like late afternoon, and the voice from the ceiling returns — softer now, almost like it's coming from inside my own chest:

*"The grand prize has been waiting in the room you kept walking past."*

I turn around.

Behind me is a door I somehow didn't notice before. It's ordinary — slightly scuffed at the bottom, paint peeling at one corner. No grand archway. No glowing edges.

Just a door.

I put my hand on the handle, and right before I turn it —

---

*the alarm goes off.*

And I lie there in the grey morning light for a long moment, staring at the ceiling, one thought sitting in my chest like something warm:

*I know what's behind that door.*

*I think I've always known.*

*Today I'll walk a little closer to it.*
