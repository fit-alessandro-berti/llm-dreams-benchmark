realize that the puzzles are not just challenges—they're reflections of your own thoughts, fears, and desires. The walls of the maze pulse faintly with light, changing color as your emotions shift. A puzzle appears before you: a glowing set of floating runes, rearranging themselves into cryptic patterns.  

You close your eyes, concentrate, and suddenly the runes morph into a phrase: _"To move forward, you must first remember."_  

A forgotten memory washes over you—you're sitting in your childhood room, stacking blocks into precise towers. Each puzzle in the maze somehow echoes that same feeling of focused creation. You smile, now understanding the connection. With a deep breath, you rearrange the runes into their proper order.  

The wall ahead vanishes, revealing a new chamber: a garden bathed in moonlight, silent but vibrant, with vines shaped like spirals of equations, whispering secrets too ancient to comprehend. In the center stands a mirror, seemingly ordinary. But as you look into it, you don’t see your reflection—you see a version of yourself walking toward you, confident and clarity-eyed.  

As the other "you" reaches out, the world around you begins to shimmer. Are you about to awaken, or step into a deeper layer of dream?  

Your hand meets theirs—and you're flooded with understanding. This maze was never meant to trap you.  

It was built for you to find yourself.
