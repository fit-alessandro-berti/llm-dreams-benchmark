…feel a surge of panic as the clock seems to tick faster than normal. Papers begin piling up mysteriously around your desk, and every time you try to sort through them, they multiply. Your boss looms over your shoulder expectantly, but when you turn to ask for help, they melt away like mist.

Suddenly, the office walls start to fade, and you realize you're no longer behind your desk but standing in an open field under a wide sky. The impossible deadline and your unfinished work flutter away on the wind like scraps of paper, and a sense of calm washes over you. You take a deep breath, feeling oddly free, and just as you start to explore this strange new world, you wake up.
