…take a deep breath before speaking again. The air around you feels heavy, almost thick, as if the tension itself has substance. Your friend’s eyes are sharp, but there’s a flicker there—something fragile behind the anger. You glance around, realizing that the place where you’re standing isn’t one you recognize; the walls ripple faintly, colors shifting like oil on water.

You decide to step closer instead of stepping away.

“I don’t want to lose you over this,” you hear yourself say, and your own voice sounds strange—like it’s echoing from far away, or coming from someone else entirely. Your friend blinks, and suddenly their expression changes… not into forgiveness exactly, but into surprise, as though you’ve just said something they’d been waiting to hear.

The ground starts tilting beneath you, and you both instinctively reach for each other’s hands. The world around you melts into an entirely different place—an endless field lit by a dim lavender sky, with enormous silent birds passing overhead. You both stand still for a moment, breathing in the strange, perfumed air.

Somewhere deep inside, you know that this argument was never really about the “thing” you were fighting over. It was about being heard. Being seen.

Your friend opens their mouth to speak… but instead of words, a small glowing moth slips out, flutters in front of you, and drifts toward the horizon. Without a word, you start following it together.  

Do you want me to continue this dream into a resolution, or turn it more surreal and symbolic?
