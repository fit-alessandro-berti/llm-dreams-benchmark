…figure out three things at once: how to survive, how to avoid drawing dangerous attention to yourself, and how—if it is even possible—you might return to your own time.

The first clues about where (and when) you are come from the rough‑hewn timber houses, the tang of woodsmoke in the air, and the absence of any humming wires or glowing screens. A church bell tolls somewhere beyond a line of twisted apple trees, and a muddy track runs between low stone walls toward a market square. Judging by the clothes on the few passers‑by—homespun wool, leather jerkins, linen coifs—you guess you have fallen into rural Europe in the late 1500s or early 1600s.

1. Find food and water  
Your stomach growls, reminding you that dreams rarely provide breakfast. In the distance you hear the bleating of goats and the clatter of wooden pails. You follow the sound to a common well where villagers draw water. Rather than stare in confusion, you copy their movements: a nod here, a polite “God keep you” there. When a red‑haired girl spills some water, you help her steady the bucket. In thanks, her mother slips you a heel of coarse barley bread. It is hard as oak bark but heavenly on your tongue.

2. Blend in (or at least stop standing out)  
Modern zippers and elastic bands would give you away in seconds, so you duck behind a cart, remove any conspicuous items—your watch, your laminated bus pass—and bury them beneath a loose flagstone. A laundry line nearby offers a faded cloak. You mutter a silent apology to its owner, wrap yourself in the scratchy fabric, and instantly look 70 percent less suspicious.

3. Secure shelter  
A wooden sign creaks above a low‑roofed building: an inn called “The Plough and Lantern.” You push through the door into a fug of hearth smoke and roasted onions. The innkeeper, a stout man with a beard like a steel brush, sizes you up. Coin is the only language he trusts, but you have none. Thinking fast, you offer to work: “I can read and write, add columns, mend quills.” Literacy is rare coin here. He squints, then hands you a slate board. You chalk out a perfect alphabet—upper‑ and lowercase—followed by a neat column of sums. The innkeeper’s eyes widen. By nightfall you have a pallet in the loft, a wooden bowl of pottage, and a simple bargain: lessons for his children in return for food and a roof.

4. Gather information  
Around the hearth, traders swap rumors: Spanish galleons off the coast, a strange comet in the night sky, a royal wedding in a distant city. You listen, piecing together a map of the year. A passing friar mentions the recent death of Queen Elizabeth. That would make the year 1603.

5. Search for a path home  
A traveling physician, Dr. Eamon Bell, boasts of studying “the newest natural philosophies” in Prague—alchemy, magnetism, the properties of “lodestones that steal the very fire of the heavens.” Your heart quickens; lodestones, magnetism—here lie the roots of the science that will one day lead to electricity and, perhaps, a way to bend time. You resolve to follow him east when he departs at the next full moon.

Days stretch into weeks. You teach letters by candlelight, scrub tables at dawn, and save every copper penny tossed your way. Each night, the same questions haunt you:

• Is this merely a dream, or have you slipped between centuries for good?  
• Will changing the past unravel the future you left behind?  
• Can knowledge from your own era help these people, or will it mark you as witch or heretic?

One storm‑lashed evening, Dr. Bell bursts back into the inn, eyes shining. “They have done it,” he whispers. “An Italian savant has built a device—mirrors set in a tube—that shows mountains upon the moon! I ride for Venice at dawn to see it with my own eyes. Come with me. The age of wonders begins.”

You look at the crackling hearth, at the sleeping forms of the innkeeper’s children you have come to care for, and at the crude parchment map that might lead you home—if “home” even exists now.

The choice looms:

A. Stay, carve out a life in 17th‑century Europe, using what you know to ease plague, ignorance, and hunger.  
B. Follow Dr. Bell and the newborn science that could someday open a door back to your century—or to unimaginable new worlds.  

You take a long breath, tasting woodsmoke and possibility, and step toward the future—whichever century it may belong to.
