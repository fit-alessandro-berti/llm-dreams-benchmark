…and each one seems to follow its own impossible logic, as if the party were arranged by the dream itself rather than any host you could name.

1. The Whispering Chefs  
   You pass a long banquet table where half-finished dishes float an inch above their plates. The chefs wear aprons stitched from old road maps and speak only in recipes for places instead of food:  
   “Two cups of sunrise from the Amalfi Coast, stirred with north-facing wind…”  
   When you ask if they have seen your friend, they answer by sprinkling salt that lands in the shape of an arrow pointing deeper into the hall.

2. The Masked Painters  
   Following the salt-arrow, you enter a room tiled in mirrors. Artists in blank white masks stand around easels, but instead of canvases they paint directly onto one another’s masks—vivid skylines, storms, entire biographies in brushstrokes.  
   You catch your own reflection and notice a smear of indigo on your cheek that wasn’t there before. A painter dips a brush in gold and, without a word, paints a tiny door over your heart. It swings open, revealing a hallway inside you that you somehow must walk through.

3. The Hallway of Pocket Doors  
   You shrink enough to step into the painted door, finding yourself in a dim corridor lined with dozens of small wooden doors no larger than glove compartments. Behind each: laughter, sobbing, orchestras tuning up. You open one at random and a memory of your first bicycle ride spills out in warm orange light.  
   A sign appears above the hallway exit: “MEMORY COAT CHECK — CLAIM TICKET ON RETURN.” You pat your pockets but find only petals.

4. The Swimmers in the Library  
   You push through the exit and emerge in a domed library filled not with air but with clear, buoyant water. People drift between shelves, reading waterproof books whose pages turn like fish fins. Words escape the sentences as bubbles; when they pop, they become tiny chimes.  
   A librarian—wearing scuba gear made of folded letters—hands you a single page on which every line is your name written in different handwriting. One of the names glows and rearranges itself into your friend’s face, smiling. An arrow composed of the other names swims ahead, guiding you upward.

5. The Rooftop Garden of Lost and Found  
   You break the library’s watery surface and find yourself on a moonlit rooftop carpeted in grass and glowing paper cranes. People mingle here, each carrying an object they’ve lost in waking life: a childhood snow globe, a missing earring, an unspoken apology.  
   At last you spot your friend across the garden, cradling a lantern shaped like a question mark. As you approach, the lantern brightens until you can’t see their features—only a silhouette washed in silver light.

   “I was looking for you,” you say.  
   “I was waiting for you to look,” they reply, voice echoing as if in two places at once. They hand you the lantern. Inside it is a miniature version of the entire party, all the rooms nested like Russian dolls.

6. The Folding Moment  
   Your friend closes your fingers around the lantern. The rooftop, the party, the night sky fold inward like the leaves of a massive origami flower. Petals become pages, pages become feathers, and you feel yourself turning into a note the wind might read.

   Just before everything snaps shut, you hear the chefs whisper, the painters laugh, the librarians’ bubbles chime, all layering into a single word:

   “Wake.”

You open your eyes in bed, hand still curved as though holding a lantern that is now only morning light pooling through the window—yet a faint indigo smear lingers on your cheek, and a golden painted door, no bigger than a postage stamp, rests over your heartbeat.
