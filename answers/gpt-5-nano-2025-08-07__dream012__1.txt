And you lift your chin, steady your breath, and raise your voice above the roar. “All hands, to your stations. Trim the fore and mainsail, reef if you must, and keep the lee side secured. Steady the helm. We ride this out together.” The deck shudders as another giant wave crashes over the bow, salt spray biting your skin, the ship’s timbers sighing under the load.

You order the rank-and-file with calm certainty: the bosun snaps a salute, the sailors move with practiced urgency, some securing lines, others watching the depths with wide, wary eyes. You feel the ship tilt toward the next wall of water, then ease as you take the wind abeam and the sails billow, catching the gusts just enough to hold your course. “Brace,” you say to a younger deckhand, “and hold fast.”

The storm answers with a chorus of thunder, a drumbeat that seems to pulse in time with your heartbeat. Lightning stitches the horizon and fades, revealing a momentary, eerie clarity: the sea is not merely hostile—it’s speaking in a language you’re only just beginning to understand. You tell the crew to secure the loose gear, to keep the hatchways battened, to look to one another for quiet strength when fear tries to creep in.

Then, as if the storm itself tires of the argument, the winds slacken and the rain thins to a mist. The waves fall away into glassy ripples, and a pale ribbon of dawn stretches along the eastern sky. The ship slides into a funnel of light, a corridor through the clouds, and for a heartbeat you glimpse an island of silver and emerald emerging from the spray—an invitation or a memory, you’re not sure.

And just as the dream shifts, as dreams always do, you wake with the ache of salt on your lips and a quiet certainty: you would face any storm again, so long as you are needed at the helm.
