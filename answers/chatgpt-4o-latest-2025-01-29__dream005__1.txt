realize that everyone is speaking in a language you don’t recognize. Strangely, you can still understand them, as if the words are translating in your mind the moment they’re spoken. 

You weave through the crowd, trying to spot your friend, but the space keeps shifting—hallways stretch longer, rooms appear where there were none before, and the lights flicker between warm candlelit glows and neon blue pulses. 

One group huddles around a tall woman in a shimmering silver coat, who stares directly at you and whispers your name. Another group bursts into laughter, though their faces seem blurred, as if they are moving slightly out of sync with time. 

Finally, you think you see your friend’s silhouette through an arched doorway draped in heavy red curtains. Just as you push them aside to step through, the floor beneath you tilts, and suddenly, you are falling—not down, but sideways—into a vast, open sky. 

What happens next?
