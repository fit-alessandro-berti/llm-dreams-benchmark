I took a deep breath and tried to calm my racing heart, but it was no use. The clock on the wall was ticking away, and I knew I had to act fast. I quickly scanned the document in front of me, my eyes widening as I realized the impossible deadline I was being given.

My boss, a no-nonsense woman with a firm grip on the armrest of her chair, looked up from her papers and raised an eyebrow. "What's the holdup, Jackson?" she asked, her voice firm but with a hint of annoyance. "We need to move this project forward, and fast."

I swallowed hard and tried to gather my thoughts. "I understand, but I need some time to review the scope and feasibility of the project," I said, hoping my words would convey the gravity of the situation. "I'll need an hour to do a preliminary analysis, and then I'll be able to propose a revised timeline."

My boss frowned, clearly unconvinced. "It's not that simple, Jackson," she said, her voice dripping with skepticism. "We've discussed this before, and I've already assigned resources to this project. I need to see some movement on it, and I need it now."

I knew I was playing a losing game. My boss had been here before, and she had always pushed me to deliver results. But I couldn't do it alone. I needed to ask for help, and fast.

I looked around the room, hoping to find someone who could assist me. My boss's assistant, a young woman with a bright smile, was typing away on her computer, seemingly oblivious to the tension in the room. I walked over to her and said, "Hi, Emma. Can I talk to you for a minute?"

She looked up, startled, and nodded. "Of course, Jackson. What's on your mind?"

"I need to ask for some help on this project," I said, gesturing to my boss. "We're facing an impossible deadline, and I need some assistance to move forward."

Emma's eyes widened, and she quickly handed me a piece of paper with a note scribbled on it. "Here, Jackson. I found this in the break room. It's a script for a prototype we developed earlier. You can use it to meet your boss's needs."

I smiled, grateful for the help. "Thanks, Emma. I owe you one. But I think I can still get this project done on my own."

My boss snorted. "Good luck with that, Jackson. You're going to need it."

I chuckled and stood up, feeling a sense of determination wash over me. I was going to get this project done, no matter what it took. And when I was done, I was going to throw it all on the table and ask for an extension. After all, I was a professional, and I knew how to work under pressure. Bring it on.
