# Finding Your Way in the City

You find yourself lost in the bustling city centered at (0,0) when a group of kind strangers offers to help. You need to determine your current location and the directions to reach your destination.

## Step 1: Identify Your Current Location
First, you should ask one of the strangers for your coordinates. Assume you have the coordinates (x, y).

## Step 2: Determine the Destination
Ask the group about your destination. Assume the destination is at (destination_x, destination_y).

## Step 3: Calculate the Distance to the Destination
Use the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance between your current location and the destination:
\[ \text{distance} = \sqrt{(destination\_x - x)^2 + (destination\_y - y)^2} \]

## Step 4: Calculate the Direction to the Destination
Calculate the direction using the atan2 function:
\[ \text{angle\_radians} = \text{atan2}(destination\_y - y, destination\_x - x) \]
Convert the angle from radians to degrees:
\[ \text{angle\_degrees} = \text{angle\_radians} \times \frac{180}{\pi} \]

## Step 5: Interpret the Angle
The angle indicates the direction to the destination. You can convert this angle to compass directions (e.g., -90 for north, 0 for east, 90 for south, 180 for west).

## Step 6: Output the Result
Output the distance and direction to the destination.

You are in the center of the city at (0, 0). Your destination is 1000 meters away at a bearing of 45 degrees (northeast). What is your next step?

Given the information, you would proceed by walking 1000 meters in the northeast direction until you reach the destination. This direction is 45 degrees from the positive x-axis, which means you need to move equally in the x and y directions (i.e., in a 1:1 ratio of x to y movement).

Since you are at the origin and your destination is also in the first quadrant, you can simply move along the line y = x to reach the destination. After moving 1000 meters at a 45-degree angle, your coordinates would be approximately (707.11, 707.11), considering the distance formula allows for movement along this line.
