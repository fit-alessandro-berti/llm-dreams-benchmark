You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching—the air thickens with the scent of petrichor, and the sky darkens to an unnatural indigo. Trees around you groan and twist, their branches knitting together like gnarled fingers, as if the forest itself is bracing for what comes next. 

A low hum vibrates in your bones, growing louder until it resolves into a chorus of whispers—voices you can’t quite decipher, layered with urgency. Rain begins to fall, but the droplets glow faintly, pooling into phosphorescent puddles that reflect not the ground, but constellations you don’t recognize. 

Lightning cracks, not white but deep violet, and in its afterimage you see silhouettes darting between the trees—figures too fluid to be human, their shapes shifting like smoke. Your heart races, yet curiosity pulls you forward. The wind carries a word, your name, or perhaps a word you’ve never heard but somehow understand: *"Remember."* 

Ahead, the forest parts to reveal a stone archway veiled in mist, its edges shimmering as though between worlds. You step toward it, compelled by a mix of dread and wonder, as the storm’s whispers swell into a roar. Just as your foot crosses the threshold, you wake—the echo of that unknown word lingering, like a riddle waiting to be solved.
