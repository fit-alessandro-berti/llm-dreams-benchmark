…can feel the entire office tilt like a board game someone just nudged. The fluorescent lights flicker into the harsh white of a hospital corridor. My chair becomes a gurney, wheels squeaking, and my boss is now wearing a surgical mask that hides everything but her eyes—bright, urgent coins.

“The files,” she says, pointing to a stack of paper that has somehow grown teeth. “Digest them. Outcome in four hours.”

I open my mouth to protest, but when I inhale the papers rush in like a flock of startled birds. Words flutter against my teeth: *scalability*… *blockchain*… *granular KPI* … They taste like dusty encyclopedias. With every page I swallow, the clock hands sprint faster, whirring into fan blades that chop the air.

My cubicle dissolves. I’m standing barefoot in a sandbox the size of an airplane hangar. Each grain is a glowing to-do item; if I miss one, it hisses and melts. My keyboard is now a beach shovel. I dig, frantically shoveling tasks into labeled buckets: BUG, FEATURE, UNKNOWN ORIGIN. The sand keeps pouring out of nowhere—no hole deep enough, no pile high enough.

Suddenly the sandbox tilts. I slide downhill toward a cliff of absolute deadline: 00:00:00 blinking red like a cardiac monitor. Just before I plummet, a hand—mine, but older, steadier—grabs my wrist.  

A mirror hangs in mid-air. The older me is on the other side, wearing the same panic for a heartbeat, then letting it fall away like loose change. She presses a finger to her lips, then points at the red zeroes. They bloom outward, transforming into seven moons that slow their orbits until time forgets to move.

“Missed deadlines don’t kill you,” she whispers; her voice is wind over pine needles. “Only unstarted ones do.” The shovel in my hand becomes a fountain pen. A single sheet of paper—on it, one sentence: “What is the smallest action that counts as a start?”

I scrawl beneath it, “Open the blank page.” The paper folds into a paper airplane and sails off the cliff, buoyed by the rising moons.

Below, the impossible deadline is now just a dark lake reflecting starlight. Ripples spread where the airplane lands, and each ripple becomes a task, orderly and calm. The sand grains arrange themselves into stepping-stones.

I take the first step. The clocks stop screaming. The boss’s eyes soften into dawn. The birds of jargon settle on my shoulder, feather-light, ready to be gently set free into the new sky.
