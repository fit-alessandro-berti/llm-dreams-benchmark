...you encounter various groups of people and each one feels strangely familiar, yet utterly alien.  

The first group is laughing at a joke only they seem to understand, their conversation a rapid-fire blend of languages you don't recognize—yet you *know* the cadence of their laughter. One woman turns, eyes wide with recognition, and whispers, "You’ve been here before," before dissolving into a shower of silver dust that clings to your sleeve like frost.  

Then you find yourself in a dimly lit lounge where everyone is dancing in slow motion, their movements synchronized to a song you’ve never heard but *remember* from a lifetime ago. A man in a long coat holds out a single rose that doesn’t wilt, its petals shifting between red, blue, and gold. "You always come here on Tuesdays," he says, his voice like distant wind chimes. "But today, you’re late."  

You rush past a room where children are building towers from clouds, their fingers passing through the material like soap bubbles. One of them looks up and calls your name, but the voice isn’t theirs—it’s *yours*, from long ago, when you were small and believed you could fly.  

You finally spot the person you came for—your friend—standing near a door that shouldn’t be there, painted in a shade of blue that glows like a forgotten memory. They're holding your favorite childhood book, the one with the cracked cover and the bookmark that says "Chapter 16, I’ll wait."  

But as you start toward them, the floor beneath you *breathes*, rising like a wave, and the entire gathering begins to shift—not in space, but in time. Faces blur into portraits of strangers, then into loved ones long gone, then into your own face, at different ages, all blinking at you in quiet understanding.  

And then you realize:  
You’re not lost.  
You’re being *remembered*.  

The dream doesn’t end—it *resets*.  
You’re standing at the edge of the room again, the same gathering, the same one person, the same book on their hands…  
And this time, you whisper the words they never said:  
*"I’m coming home."*
