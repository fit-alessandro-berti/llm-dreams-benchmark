You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you grip the railing as lightning illuminates the churning waves. The timber underfoot groans, and the rigging overhead whistles with each brutal gust of wind. You’ve been through your share of storms before—enough to have faces flash in memory, both those who weathered the gales and those who did not—but this one feels different. The clouds are a wounded shade of purple, and something seems to throb just beyond the horizon, like a heartbeat in the night.

You raise your voice against the roar, shouting for the crew to secure the sails. The first mate, O’Malley, struggles at the helm, jaw clenched, knuckles white. Carter and Ruiz scramble on the slippery deck, tying down loose ropes and pulling tarps over the cargo. A lantern’s feeble light sways, casting wild shadows that make the deck look like the belly of a great leviathan. You see the youngest deckhand, Nell, wide-eyed and drenched, clinging to the railing and looking at you as if you can command the sky itself.

You point to the horizon, yelling, “Brace! Here it comes!” A monstrous wave rears up, its crest gleaming under a sudden flash. You taste salt and fear in equal measure. But instead of simply crashing down, the water looms and twists, and within its curling form, you glimpse something impossible: the outline of a massive, silvery eye staring back. Your heart nearly stops. This is no ordinary tempest.

The hull shudders. The wave collapses into spray and foam, drenching everyone, leaving behind a hush so deep it seems to swallow the thunder. Even the wind seems to falter for a breath. Now the water churns with intent, and you realize the ship is being pulled, caught in a swift current that didn’t exist moments ago. It’s as if the sea itself has chosen to guide you. The crew, still caught between terror and trust in you, waits for your next command.

You shout, “Hoist the storm jib! Keep us steady!” The crew scrambles, their movements sharper, more desperate. Together, you lean into the reality that you are no longer just fighting nature’s fury, but something stranger and older than you can name.

As you steer into the heart of the storm, the ship’s bow cuts through waters that now glow faintly with bioluminescent sparks. Blue-green lights glimmer in the foam, revealing shapes darting beneath the surface. Are they fish? Something larger? One leaps, a sleek, serpent-like form with wings of shimmering membrane that vanish as it arcs back under the waves. Your crew gasps collectively, and for the briefest instant, wonder pierces fear.

When you glance back at the deck, you see that the rigging has begun to hum softly. The wind carries a distant melody, haunting and low. Despite the violence of the storm, it’s as if the world has grown quieter, focusing all its intent on your ship. You hear O’Malley gasp: “Cap’n, look!” and he points dead ahead.

Something emerges in the dark: a towering column of stone rising straight out of the open ocean. It’s not on any chart you’ve studied. Its surface is carved with swirling symbols that shimmer in the lightning flashes. The current rushes you onward, as if the entire sea wants you to approach it. Fear prickles at your skin, but also a curious pull—an instinct that you might find answers here, or doom.

“Drop anchor!” you call, even though the water’s churn makes that seem impossible. Your crew obeys, hauling and heaving, the chain rattling through the hawse pipe. To your astonishment, the anchor catches. The ship lurches, steadies, then rocks gently in a strange calm that forms around this towering spire.

The storm rages beyond the perimeter, winds screaming and rain lashing, but here, directly beneath the great stone pillar, the sea is oddly placid. The crew murmurs, uncertain. You meet their eyes, one by one, and raise your lantern. In its glow, you swear you see the glyphs on the pillar shift, rearranging themselves into patterns of stars and waves. A voice, or perhaps just a distant thought, whispers inside your head: “Enter.”

And though you know this must be a dream—or something that dreams are made of—you step to the railing and prepare to lower a longboat. Your crew watches, waiting for your signal. Inside you, resolve and curiosity mingle. No one knew what secrets the storm carried, but now, guided by impossible currents, confronted by living glyphs and impossible creatures, you have come to this mysterious place. You will guide your crew onward and downward, into the strange heart of this ocean secret. You will discover what lies behind that eye in the waves and the whisper in the night. And as you climb into the longboat, lantern raised, you know that—dream or not—you are destined to find the answer.
