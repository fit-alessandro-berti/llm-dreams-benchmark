> You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. 

You're taken aback by the sudden change in weather, because before you had stepped into the tranquil atmosphere of the forest, full of life and calmness. Birds chirped melodies filling the air; the rustling leaves beneath your feet added rhythmic harmony to the serene scene around you. The dappled sunlight filtering through the trees cast vibrant shadows on the ground that danced with an otherworldly grace. 

But despite this idyllic backdrop, it does not deter or slow down your steady steps as you move forward under the eerie storm cloud gathering fast before you. Its roar is almost deafening and its light, though not yet bright enough to blind you, creates long shadows that appear ominous in the daylight landscape around you.

The sound of heavy drops cascading down onto the leaves below makes it hard to hear your own breathing except for an occasional "whoosh-whap". Every clap from the rain against the dense trees resonates within the silence making the whole situation feel like it can turn into a silent tornado at any moment, threatening everything including yourself.

You are prepared though; your senses heightened by this strange yet intriguing event as you continue down through the forest, taking deep breaths to steady your nerves and keeping one eye on the turbulent sky above while carrying a firm determination in heart about what is destined for you ahead of this stormy time.
