You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and—  

The sky darkens to bruised purple in seconds. Trees whip violently as wind tears leaves into swirling green confetti. Thunder cracks like splitting mountains, shaking the ground beneath your feet. Rain lashes down, icy and sharp, soaking you to the bone. Ahead, an ancient oak groans, its roots tearing free from the mud with a sound like a dying beast.  

As you stumble backward, lightning forks across the sky—illuminating a figure standing motionless in the clearing. A stag, antlers like polished obsidian, stares at you with eyes that glow silver. Rain streams off its hide like liquid mercury. It doesn’t flee. Instead, it lowers its head, antlers pointing toward a crumbling stone archway half-buried in ivy—one you never noticed before.  

The wind howls a warning, but curiosity pulls you forward. You step through the arch…  

And silence.  

The storm vanishes. You stand in a sun-drenched meadow under a turquoise sky. Butterflies drift over wildflowers that pulse with soft light. The stag is gone, but in the grass lies a single, perfect feather—iridescent blue, warm to the touch. When you pick it up, the world blurs.  

You wake clutching your pillow, heart racing. On your bedside table, a stray sunbeam catches something: a faint, shimmering dusting of blue on your fingertips.
