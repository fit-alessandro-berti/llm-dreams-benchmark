open your mouth, prepared to deliver the crucial opening line, and instead of words, a cascade of perfectly ripe blueberries tumbles out.

They spill rapidly, a constant, gentle deluge of dark purple fruit splashing softly onto the polished wood of the lectern and dropping onto the stage floor. The sound is hushed, a wet, rhythmic pitter-patter that quickly replaces the silence of the anticipation.

The audience, a vast sea of faces that had been focused and expectant, begins to shift. They aren’t reacting with panic, but with intense, analytical confusion. Their expressions aren't angry; they are counting the berries.

You try to clamp your mouth shut, but the mechanism of the dream is insistent. The blueberries keep flowing, now mixed with smooth, grey river stones and the occasional, delicate feather from a wren. You look down at your hands, which are still gripping the edges of the podium, and realize they are now covered in bright, emerald-green moss.

The stage lights overhead start humming a high, thin note, and the audience seats slowly dissolve into a thick, swirling mist of cold white vapor. The blueberries, the stones, and the feathers continue to accumulate until you are standing thigh-deep in a silent, strangely sweet-smelling ocean of fruit and rock.

You want to apologize, to explain that you were supposed to talk about quantum mechanics, or perhaps the importance of municipal bonds, but the only sound you can produce is the soft, comforting slosh of your footsteps as you try to wade toward the edge of the stage, which has now become the shore of a vast, misty sea.

And then, you realize you are naked, and everyone—even the mist—is still watching.
