The sound of thunder grows louder, and the wind picks up, rustling the leaves of the trees around me. I try to take a step back, but my feet feel rooted to the spot. The storm is brewing, and I can see the dark clouds gathering on the horizon.

Suddenly, a strong gust of wind blows, and I stumble forward, my arms outstretched to steady myself. The storm's edge looms closer, and I feel a sense of unease. The air is charged with electricity, and I can feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end.

As I stand there, frozen in fear, a bolt of lightning strikes the ground mere feet away. The thunder is deafening, and the wind is so strong that it's almost impossible to move. I feel a strange, tingling sensation in my fingers, as if they're being lifted up and spun around in a circle.

The storm is reaching its crescendo, and I feel myself being drawn towards it, like a moth to a flame. I'm not sure what's happening, but I feel an intense energy building inside me. The forest around me begins to distort and blur, and I feel myself being pulled into a vortex of swirling colors and lights.

The storm rages on, and I'm swept up in its fury. I'm lifted off the ground, and I feel my feet flailing wildly as I'm tossed about like a rag doll. I'm screaming, but my voice is drowned out by the thunder. The world around me is a kaleidoscope of sound and color, and I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality.

And then, just as suddenly as it began, the storm dissipates. The thunder ceases, and the wind dies down. I'm left standing in stunned silence, the forest quiet once more. I take a deep breath, trying to process what just happened. I'm not sure what's real and what's just a dream, but I know that I've been a part of something much bigger than myself.
