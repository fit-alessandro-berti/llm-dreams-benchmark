You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language you don't recognize—symbols that swirl and shift like liquid on the page.  

You glance around, but the other students are already writing furiously, as if it's perfectly clear. Panic starts to rise in your chest. Then, you realize something strange: the symbols aren't just random. They seem to respond to your focus, rearranging themselves into shapes that feel almost familiar.  

You take a deep breath and look closer. One symbol morphs into the outline of a tree you climbed as a child. Another becomes the formula for the first chemical reaction you ever loved. The questions aren't testing what you memorized—they're asking who you are, what you've lived, what you truly understand in your bones.  

A calm settles over you. You pick up your pen. It no longer feels like an exam, but a conversation. And you begin to write your future, not from a textbook, but from your life.
