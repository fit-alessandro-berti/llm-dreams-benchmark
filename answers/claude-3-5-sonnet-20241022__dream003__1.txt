Let me continue this dream sequence:

... intricate patterns and symbols etched into its dark wooden surface that seem to shift and dance in the changing light. As I run my fingers over the engravings, they begin to glow with a soft, blue luminescence. Suddenly, I notice that the patterns form a maze-like structure, and when I trace a particular sequence with my finger, the box emanates a gentle humming sound.

The humming grows stronger, and the air around the box becomes thick with what looks like floating specks of starlight. The patterns begin to reconfigure themselves, moving like liquid metal across the surface, until they form words in an ancient script that, somehow, I can understand. They read: \ never arrives?\ \ The lid slowly opens, revealing not an empty space, but what appears to be a window into an infinite night sky, complete with swirling galaxies and shooting stars. From within, a small constellation rises up and hovers above my palm, twinkling with possibility...

Would you like me to continue this dream sequence further?
