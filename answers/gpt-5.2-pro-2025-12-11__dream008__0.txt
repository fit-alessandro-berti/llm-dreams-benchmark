…you look down at the project brief and realize the pages are blank, except for a single sentence that keeps rewriting itself: **DUE YESTERDAY.**

Your boss is standing behind you, too close, not breathing, not blinking—just waiting with a pen poised like a needle. Around you, the office is louder than it should be: keyboards clacking in perfect unison, a copier wheezing like an old animal, the low hum of fluorescent lights turning into a distant chorus saying your name.

You reach for your mouse. It’s warm, like it’s been in someone else’s hand. The cursor on your screen is already moving, dragging windows open and closed on its own. Each time you try to click, the arrow skitters away, as if it’s afraid of you.

“Go on,” your boss says, but their voice comes from your monitor, from the phone on your desk, from the air vent above your head. You try to answer, but your mouth is full of paper—soft, damp pages that taste like printer ink. You cough, and a staple lands on your palm with a tiny metallic sting.

You decide to start anyway.

You type the first word. It appears in the wrong font, the wrong language, then rearranges itself into a list of your unfinished tasks from years ago. The file name updates automatically: **FINAL_FINAL_THIS_ONE_REALLY_FINAL_v38**.

You glance at the clock in the corner of the screen. The minutes are running backward. The second hand is jittering like a trapped insect. Then the clock isn’t a clock anymore—it’s an hourglass, but the sand is spilling upward, collecting in midair, forming a small hovering storm above your desk.

Someone walks past and smiles at you with sympathy, but their face is slightly blurred, like a video buffering. When they speak, it’s only the sound of an email notification.

You stand up to find help, but your chair has become a rolling office chair attached to a seatbelt. It tightens across your waist as the floor subtly tilts. The entire office begins to slope downward, cubicles sliding like furniture on a sinking ship. Papers flutter past like white birds, some with your handwriting, some with your name stamped in red.

You grip the edge of your desk. It stretches—elongates—as if made of taffy. The monitor moves farther away no matter how many times you pull it close. Your boss is still behind you, still waiting, but now they’re wearing a lanyard that reads **APPROVAL PENDING**.

“Just send a draft,” they say.

You open your inbox to send something—anything—and every email is from you, timestamped tomorrow, containing increasingly frantic versions of the same message:

- *I’m almost done.*
- *I can explain.*
- *I’m starting now.*
- *I promise I’m starting now.*

Your fingers begin to type without you. A document opens. It’s already full—charts, bullet points, confident conclusions—except the content is a description of what you are doing in this exact moment, including the sentence you are reading right now.

You try to scroll down to the end, but there is no end. The scrollbar shrinks to a dot. The page becomes a hallway, long and white, lit by office lights that buzz and buzz until the buzzing sounds like laughter.

A meeting invite pops up: **MANDATORY: RIGHT NOW.**  
Location: **YOUR DESK.**  
Attendees: **EVERYONE.**

All the chairs swivel toward you at once. Everyone’s face has your boss’s expression—patient, expectant, waiting. You feel the deadline pressing on you like a hand on the back of your neck.

You take a deep breath and decide to do the only thing that makes sense in a dream.

You press **Ctrl + Z**.

The room hiccups. The lights flicker. The carpet ripples as if something underneath is turning over. You press it again. The copier coughs and spits out a single page: a childlike drawing of you sitting at a desk, holding a pen like it’s too heavy.

You press **Ctrl + Z** again, harder, like force matters.

The office rewinds: people walking backward, coffee rising into mugs, paper scraps leaping neatly into stacks. The impossible deadline on your screen changes from **DUE YESTERDAY** to **DUE LATER** to **DUE WHEN READY**.

Your boss’s face softens, then blurs, then becomes an empty swivel chair that slowly turns to face you. On the seat is a sticky note. It reads:

**WAKE UP.**

You blink—and the sticky note is on your own hand.

You peel it off, but it clings. You peel again, and the sound is enormous, like tearing fabric in a silent room. The office walls thin into paper. The ceiling crinkles. The whole workplace becomes a folded model—an origami cubicle—balanced on the edge of your desk.

You inhale, and the paper office trembles.

You exhale, and it collapses neatly, impossibly, into a single square sheet.

On the sheet is the first real instruction you’ve seen all day:

**START ANYWHERE.**

You pick up a pen. This time it writes. The ink is dark and steady. You draw a simple line—just a beginning—and as the tip moves, the buzzing fades, the lights warm, and the weight in your chest loosens as if something inside you has unclenched.

Your boss is gone. The deadline is gone. The office is quiet enough to hear your own breathing.

And somewhere, far away, an alarm begins to ring—softly at first, then louder—like a phone you forgot you were holding.

You look down.

The pen in your hand has become a toothbrush.

You’re in your bathroom, standing at the sink, heart racing, the taste of printer ink fading from your mouth. The mirror shows your face, ordinary and startled. On your wrist, faintly, there’s the ghost of a sticky note, as if it had been there for years.

In the other room, your real phone keeps ringing.

You go to silence it, already half-convinced that when you pick it up, your boss will be on the line, asking—calmly, patiently—if you’ve started yet.
