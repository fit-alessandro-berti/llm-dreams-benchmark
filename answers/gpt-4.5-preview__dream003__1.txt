symbols engraved into its surface, seemingly glowing faintly in pulses synchronizing with your heartbeat. As you run your fingers along the patterns, they begin shifting subtly, rearranging themselves into constellations of stars that seem oddly familiar, yet distant. Curiously, you trace specific star points, and suddenly the box emits a gentle hum.

A shimmering, ghostly shape emerges above the box, forming slowly into a magnificent, breathing tree with branches that stretch upward and roots extending deep below, suspended in mid-air. Each branch bears golden leaves engraved with unreadable texts, shimmering softly as you approach. As soon as your fingers touch a leaf, you feel warm comfort flow through your veins, and you suddenly remember something long forgotten.

The box gently clicks open by itself, shining with an inviting glow. Inside waits something you've always secretly longed for—something precious, cherished, and meaningful—and as you reach in to hold it, the dream slowly dissolves into waking reality.
