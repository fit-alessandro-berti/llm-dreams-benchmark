feel the weight of the wheel grinding beneath your hands, the salt spray stinging your face like needles. The mast groans overhead, a jagged crack splitting the night sky as lightning bleeds into the waves. Your first mate yells something lost in the wind, pointing to the starboard side—there’s a break in the clouds, faint but steady, a sliver of stars aligning above the water. You recognize the pattern. It’s the same constellation your grandmother used to trace on your palm during power outages, whispering stories about sailors who followed their fears instead of their stars.

You make a decision—not based on charts or wind, but on memory, on trust. “Hard to starboard!” you shout, voice raw but clear. The crew hesitates a breath, then surges into motion. The ship leans into the turn, carving a path toward the light.

And then, silence. The storm doesn’t fade—it *parts*, like a curtain drawing open. Ahead, an island appears, glowing with amber mist, music drifting across the waves. A place no map has marked.

You look back at your crew. Their faces are no longer grim, but wondering. One asks, “Did we find it… or did it find us?”

What does the music sound like to you?
