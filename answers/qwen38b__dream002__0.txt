You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air grows heavy with a metallic tang, as if the sky itself is holding its breath. The trees, once whispering secrets in the breeze, now stand rigid, their leaves trembling as dark clouds swallow the sunlight. A low rumble of thunder shakes the ground, and the wind howls like a wounded beast, tearing through the branches.  

As the storm erupts, rain lashes your face in icy sheets, but the water seems to shimmer with an eerie, silver glow. You stumble forward, disoriented, until you reach a clearing where the storm’s fury abruptly halts. The sky splits open, revealing not thunder, but a cascade of luminescent symbols—ancient, shifting script that pulses like a heartbeat. The ground beneath you cracks, revealing a glowing path leading into the earth.  

A voice, neither male nor female, echoes in your mind: *“The storm is a door. What lies beyond is your truth.”*  

Tentatively, you step onto the glowing path, and the world dissolves into a swirl of light. When your vision clears, you’re no longer in the forest—but standing in a mirrored chamber, each wall reflecting not your face, but fragments of memories you’ve forgotten: a child’s laughter, a lover’s touch, a decision you’ve never made. The storm’s voice returns, softer now: *“You were always here. You chose the forest to find yourself.”*  

The mirrors ripple, and you wake, breathless, on the forest floor—drenched, but smiling. The storm has passed, and the trees are bathed in gold. But you know now: the dream was a map, and the journey is only beginning.
