You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **storm out of the room, but the door handle twists in your hand, refusing to turn. The walls of the room begin to pulse like a heartbeat, and your friend’s voice fractures into echoes, saying, *“You’re not listening—none of us ever do.”*  

As you stare at the door, it morphs into a mirror. Your reflection isn’t yours—it’s a stranger, eyes hollow, whispering, *“You’ll never fix this.”* Your friend steps closer, their face blurred, and offers you a key. It’s shaped like a question mark. You reach for it, but the dream dissolves into static, leaving only the sound of your own breath and the faint hum of a distant, unresolved melody.  

When you wake, your chest aches, and the key remains lodged in your palm, cold and unyielding.
