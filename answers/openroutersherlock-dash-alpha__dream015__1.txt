You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to rally a ragtag band of survivors—scavengers, ex-soldiers, and a wise-cracking mechanic with a cybernetic arm—into a nomadic convoy. You dub it the "Iron Nomads," jury-rigging armored trucks from rusted hulks and solar panels scavenged from ruined cities.

Your first raid targets a feral raider camp hoarding pre-war canned goods. Under cover of a dust storm, you flank them: grenades fashioned from fertilizer and bottle rockets distract the guards, while your mechanic hacks their turrets with a salvaged EMP drone. Chaos erupts—bullets whiz like angry hornets, but your crew moves like shadows. You personally take down the raider boss in a brutal knife fight atop a crumbling water tower, his blood mixing with the red dust as the sun sets in a blaze of orange.

Victorious, you claim not just food, but a map to a legendary bunker: "Eden Vault," whispered to hold hydroponic farms, clean water, and seeds for rebuilding. But shadows stir—mutated hounds track your scent, and rival warlords catch wind of your growing legend. As your convoy rolls into the irradiated badlands, engines roaring defiance, you spot distant lights flickering on the horizon. Allies? Or the end of your dream?

The dust swirls thicker... and you wake, heart pounding, wondering if Eden was real.
