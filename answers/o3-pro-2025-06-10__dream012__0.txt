…plant your boots against the heaving deck and raise your voice above the wind.

“Hands to the sheets! Reef the mainsail to half! Lash yourselves if you must, but hold her steady!”

Your words cut through the thunder like flares. The helmsman—wide-eyed, rain-slick—grips the wheel as if it were the last real thing left in the world. Lanterns swing like panicked fireflies, casting crooked shadows of ropes and rigging that jerk across the deck.

The sea climbs higher, black green walls curling over the rail. For a heartbeat you glimpse your own reflection in the water’s face: tired, determined, a single candle in an ocean of ink. Then the wave crashes and the world goes white with spray. Cold needles of salt sting your eyes, yet a strange calm settles inside you—an anchor of certainty that seems borrowed from some place beyond the storm.

You bellow again: “Set the storm jib! Trust the wind, not your fear!”

Hands scramble up the ratlines. Canvas booms open like battered wings, and the ship answers. She heels, groans, then slices across the swell instead of fighting it. You feel her mood change—no longer prey but dancer, cutting the spiral path you pictured in your mind moments before.

Lightning forks so close you smell the metal-sharp scent of ozone. In its glare you notice something impossible: the raindrops have slowed, hanging in the air like glass beads on invisible threads. The wind still howls, yet each droplet spins lazily, reflecting fractured constellations.

Time, it seems, has decided to pause and watch.

A hush sweeps the decks. Every sailor turns to you, their features illuminated in stop-motion flashes. In their eyes you read an unspoken question that has nothing to do with sails or survival: Why are we truly here?

You step to the rail and stare into the waiting sea. Beneath the surface a glow pulses—soft, rhythmic, like a heart beneath layers of dark cloth. The ocean is breathing. Each throb pushes out a ring of light that ripples up the towering waves, calming them, laying them down as gently as blankets on sleeping children.

When you speak again your voice is quiet, yet everyone hears it as though whispered directly into their ears. “Easy now. The storm was only the sea trying to teach us its song.”

You close your eyes. The deck ceases to pitch. Footsteps lighten. Some crew laugh, some weep. One by one, they peel away from the ropes and look around as if seeing the horizon for the first time. Dawn burns through the clouds in silent sheets of coral and gold.

The ship glides forward on a mirror-still ocean that reflects a sky scrubbed clean. Masts sigh; gulls wheel overhead. In the gentle roll you notice the water beading on your coat vanishes into steam, as though the sun has chosen you for its first warm breath.

A sailor approaches with a puzzled smile. “Captain, where do we head now? There’s no wind, no charts for seas like this.”

You answer without hesitation, words arriving from a place deeper than thought: “We sail toward the part of ourselves that has been waiting to wake up.”

The helmsman nods, understanding more than he should, and turns the wheel a single spoke. The ship responds, prow cutting a silken path across a sea that glows from within.

As the light brightens, the deck blurs. Wood becomes mist, sails dissolve into cloud, and your crew, still smiling, fade into motes that drift upward like sparks.

You realize you, too, are becoming lighter, your boots no longer touching anything solid. The sky tilts, and you rise through it, a breath exhaled by the dream itself.

Just before everything turns to pure morning, you hear the echo of your own command, reshaped as invitation:

“Trust the wind, not your fear.”

Then, with a final glint of salt on your lips, you wake—heart steady, eyes clear—carrying the hush of that impossible calm into the day that waits beyond your window.
