I pick up the brush, but the bristles are not made of hair; they are a cluster of tiny, vibrating stars. The handle feels like cool liquid glass in my hand. I dip the bristles into the air itself, and the stars cling to a globule of **midnight blue** that smells like distant rain.

On the canvas, I paint a door.

As the paint touches the canvas, the frame begins to grow. It pushes outward, splinters turning into twisting trees, the knob warming into a small sun. I step through the canvas, leaving the swirling chaos of the background behind me.

I am now standing in a quiet room where the walls are made of silence and the floor is a mirror of polished obsidian. In the center of the room sits a single chair, woven from beams of golden light.

I sit down, and as I do, I realize I am not the dreamer. I am the painting, and I am finally waking up.
