You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air crackles with an almost palpable energy.  Giant, ancient trees, normally draped in a gentle, golden light, now loom over you, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching for a bruised sky.  A low, guttural growl reverberates through the earth, not from an animal, but from the very forest itself.

The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble.  Not a gentle shake, but a deep, unsettling shudder that makes your teeth chatter.  A blinding flash of electric violet light illuminates a clearing ahead, revealing a towering, obsidian spire erupting from the earth, pulsating with an inner fire.  Smoke, thick and acrid, curls around its base, carrying a strange, metallic scent.

The trees around you twist and writhe, groaning in protest.  Leaves, once a vibrant green, now seem to be coated in a frost that isn't cold, but somehow burning.  Tiny, glowing sparks erupt from the forest floor, dancing and leaping in the pre-storm air.  You hear the snap of branches, not as individual sounds, but as a unified, terrible chorus.

Fear, raw and primal, grips you. You want to run, but your legs feel leaden, anchored to the shifting ground.  A figure, cloaked in the same violet as the lightning, materialises at the base of the spire.  It is tall and gaunt, with eyes that seem to hold the entire darkness of the storm within them.  It raises a hand, and the wind whips up, carrying with it a whisper, not of words, but of memories, of forgotten stories, of a forgotten power.  The whisper promises untold knowledge, unspeakable power… and a terrible, inevitable fate.
