...the air crackles with an electric tension.  The sun, which had been a warm caress on my skin moments before, is now a harsh, accusing eye in the sky.  The leaves, once a vibrant emerald, begin to shiver and rustle, their whispers turning into a frantic chorus.  The gentle breeze, now a howling gale, whips through the trees, tearing at my clothes and sending a shiver down my spine.  

The ground beneath my feet, soft and mossy moments ago, becomes a treacherous, slick surface.  The path I was following, once a clear and inviting trail, is now obscured by a swirling curtain of rain and wind.  The trees, once sentinels of peace, now seem to writhe and groan, their branches lashing out like angry claws.  

A flash of lightning illuminates the sky, revealing a monstrous, swirling cloud that dwarfs the sun.  The thunder, a deep, guttural roar, shakes the very ground beneath me.  I stumble, my feet slipping on the wet leaves, and I know, with a sudden, terrifying clarity, that I am not alone in this storm.  

A low growl, guttural and primal, echoes through the air.  I turn, my heart pounding in my chest, and see it.  A creature emerges from the swirling mist, its eyes glowing with an eerie, otherworldly light.  Its fur is the color of storm clouds, its claws sharp as obsidian, and its teeth gleam like daggers in the lightning's flash.  It is a creature of the storm, a predator of the wild, and it is coming for me. 


What do you do?
