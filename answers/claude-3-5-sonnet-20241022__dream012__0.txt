I'll play along with this dream scenario:

The storm intensifies, and I grip the ship's wheel tightly, feeling it fight against my hands as massive waves crash against the bow. The rain is so heavy it feels like needles against my face, but I keep my eyes fixed on the horizon where I can just barely make out a strange, greenish glow through the darkness.

\ first mate shouts over the howling wind. \ it's not natural!\ in my gut that the mysterious light ahead is both our greatest danger and our only hope for survival. Making a split-second decision, I turn the wheel hard to port, toward the eerie glow.

\ hands brace!\ over the tempest. \ going to face this head-on!\

As we approach the light, the water beneath us begins to swirl, creating a massive vortex that seems to be pulling us toward its center. But instead of fighting it, I sense this is a passage - a gateway to somewhere else. The crew's faces show fear mixed with trust as we cross the threshold between worlds...
