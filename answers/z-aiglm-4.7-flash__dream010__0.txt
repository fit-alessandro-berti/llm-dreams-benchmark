...and the very air around you begins to thicken, transforming from the cool arena air into a heavy, amber fog. The judges, who were once stern figures in suits, now morph into towering trees whose branches are made of cobwebs. The challenge shifts from physical tasks to something psychological: to find the 'Golden Compass' buried somewhere within this fog, you have to cross a bridge made entirely of glass shards.

The tension rises as you step onto the bridge; you look down to see your reflection below, but it isn't you—it is a version of you who failed. You reach the center, your hand trembling, when suddenly the compass appears in your palm, but it isn't pointing North, it's pointing to a single, open door.

You push through the door and the dream dissolves instantly. You find yourself sitting up in bed, sweating slightly, wondering which version of you—the one who made it to the door, or the one who stayed behind on the glass bridge—has actually won the dream job.
