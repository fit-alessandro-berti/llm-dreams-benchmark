### You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to…

**…panic for a moment, your heart racing as you glance at your watch.** It’s already 9:05 AM — the meeting starts at 10:00. You take a deep breath, trying to calm yourself. *Okay, think. There must be a clue somewhere.*

You pull out your phone, but there’s no signal. No GPS, no maps, no emails. The city around you is eerily quiet — wide cobblestone streets lined with tall, ornate buildings that seem to shift when you isn’t looking directly at them. The air smells faintly of old paper and rain.

Determined, you start walking, scanning for any sign of familiarity. Every few steps, the architecture changes slightly — one block is Gothic spires, the next is sleek modern glass, then suddenly a bustling market selling translucent fruits that glow in the dim light.

As you turn a corner, you notice a small, weathered sign nailed to a lamassu statue:  
**“The Clockmaker’s Alley – Third turning left, then follow the sound of ticking.”**

You frown. *A riddle?* You hesitate, but time is ticking — quite literally. You decide to follow the directions. You walk down the alley, and sure enough, the air fills with the faint, synchronized ticking of countless clocks hidden in the walls. The sound grows louder as you approach a hidden courtyard bathed in soft, golden light.

In the center stands an old man with a top hat and spectacles, adjusting a giant, floating pocket watch that hovers above his palm. He looks up as you approach.

“You’re late,” he says, without looking up. His voice echoes as if spoken from far away.

“I—I don’t know where I’m supposed to be,” you admit, sweating slightly.

He pauses, then nods. “Then you’ve come to the right place. The meeting isn’t about what you think it is. It’s about *why* you’re here.”

He gestures to a bench beneath an ancient willow tree whose branches shimmer like liquid silver. “Sit. Remember what you saw on your way here. Every detail matters.”

You sit, and as you close your eyes, the memories flash — the shifting streets, the glowing market, the sign, the ticking. Something feels… *off*. The city wasn’t just unfamiliar — it was *responding* to you. The market sold only things you had dreamed of before. The streets bent when you blinked.

The old man nods again. “The city is a mirror. It shows you what you need to see — or what you’re trying to hide from.”

Just then, a soft chime rings out — like a crystal glass tapping against a spoon. The meeting has begun.

Around you, figures begin to appear — translucent, shadowy versions of people you know: your past self, your greatest rival, a version of your mother who never aged, a child version of yourself holding a broken toy.

They sit in a circle, silent, watching you.

The old man steps back. “Speak. Why are you here?”

---

**What do you say?**  
Do you:  
1. **Speak about your fears — the reason you’ve been avoiding this meeting?**  
2. **Try to explain that you’re lost, that you don’t even know what the meeting is about?**  
3. **Ask the old man for clarification — demand to know what this is really about?**  
4. **Look at the figures and try to understand which one holds the key to your purpose here?**

Choose your path, and the dream will unfold…
