You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and each one pulls you into their bizarre orbit, like moths to a flame in a dream where gravity flips on a whim.

First, there's a cluster of laughing executives in pinstripe suits, sipping neon cocktails that taste like forgotten childhood candies. They insist you join their "deal of the century," whispering stock tips that morph into riddles about flying elephants. You excuse yourself, but your feet stick to the marble floor, leaving shoeprints that glow like constellations.

Next, a circle of artists with paint-splattered faces surround a canvas that's actually a mirror, reflecting not your face but alternate versions of yourself—pirate you, astronaut you, you as a giant talking squirrel. They hand you a brush dipped in liquid starlight, and suddenly you're painting the room's walls into a jungle, vines snaking up chandeliers.

Dodging through, you stumble into a group of musicians whose instruments are edible: a violin made of licorice strings, a drum of warm bread. They play a melody that makes your heartbeats sync with theirs, and for a moment, you're all levitating, feet dangling above a sea of floating hors d'oeuvres.

Deeper in, philosophers in togas debate the ethics of dreams within dreams, offering you a glowing apple that promises infinite wisdom—or eternal hiccups. You take a bite, and time loops: the party rewinds, fast-forwards, everyone aging backward into giggling toddlers.

Finally, weaving through a fog of perfume and confetti, you spot your one familiar face across the ballroom. But as you reach them, they turn, smiling, and whisper, "You've been looking for me? I've been you all along." The lights dim, the crowd dissolves into swirling colors, and you wake up—heart racing, wondering if the party's still going on somewhere in your subconscious.
