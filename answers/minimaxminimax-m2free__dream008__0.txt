The fluorescent light hums like a beehive and my desk is a map of coffee rings and spreadsheets. The binder lands—Project: Apotheosis—punched into the table like a thunderclap. “By lunch,” your boss says, voice steady as a metronome, tapping the watch on his wrist that never marks noon.

I open the binder. Blank pages. The pen in my hand is heavy as a statue and writes only numbers that multiply when I look away. Emails bloom into a storm of bold, urgent text with exclamation points sprouting like horns. The clock on the wall is a blistering sun stuck high, but it doesn’t move. Across the hallway a whiteboard fills itself with steps I don’t recognize, arrows turning into snakes, snakes into diagrams that swallow themselves.

A coworker slides a laminated checklist over and nods like a sentinel. “You got this.” The coffee machine gurgles like a whale. I flip to page one. A single line: "Begin." No map, no end. Outside the window, clouds slide sideways in the wrong sky.

I lift the pen—our teeth meet the midnight city’s hum—and the room holds its breath. Will I race the sun, conjure an impossible algorithm, or find the loophole inside the paper? The cursor blinks, the boss watches, and somewhere a clock admits it’s lying.
