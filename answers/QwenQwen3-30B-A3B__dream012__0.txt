You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you feel the deck shudder beneath your boots like a living thing. The sky is a churning canvas of ink and lightning, and the wind screams through the rigging, tearing at the sails with feral desperation. Waves rise like mountains, their crests foaming with fury, and the ship lurches as if trying to outrun the chaos.  

"Hard to port!" you bellow, your voice swallowed by the gale. The helmsman, a weathered man with salt-cracked hands, grunts as he strains against the wheel. The crew scrambles to secure the rigging, their faces pale, eyes wide with the primal fear of being at the mercy of forces older than time. A young deckhand slips on the wet planks, and you grab his arm, hauling him upright as a wave crashes over the bow, drenching everyone in brine.  

But you don’t falter. You remember the old tales—of storms that test not just the ship, but the soul. You shout orders, sharp and steady, as if the rhythm of your voice could steady the world. "Sheet in the mainsail! Secure the cargo! Keep the ballast!" The crew moves, a blur of motion, their fear sharpening into purpose.  

Then, a crack of thunder splits the air, and the mast groans. A splintered beam falls, narrowly missing the quartermaster. The ship lurches again, and for a heartbeat, the world tilts sideways. You see the horizon flicker, as if the sea itself is holding its breath.  

In that moment, you realize the storm isn’t just outside—you feel it in your chest, the chaos of doubt, the weight of responsibility. But you’ve sailed through worse. You step to the helm, your hand steady on the wheel, and you speak not to the crew, but to the storm. "You cannot drown me," you whisper, though the words are lost in the wind.  

And then, something shifts. The waves, though still violent, begin to lose their edge, as if the storm has heard you. The lightning dims, the winds ease, and the sea, though still restless, no longer feels like an enemy. The crew exhales in unison, their faces etched with exhaustion and wonder.  

As the first rays of dawn pierce the clouds, you glance at the horizon. The storm is gone, but the sea remains, vast and unknowable. You tighten your grip on the wheel, knowing this was only the beginning. The dream lingers, but the ship sails on.
