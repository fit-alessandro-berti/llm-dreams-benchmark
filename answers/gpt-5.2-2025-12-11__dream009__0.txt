…survive long enough to figure out *when* you are.

The air smells like wet earth and woodsmoke. When you sit up, your palm presses into grass slick with morning dew, and your first stupid impulse is to check your phone—only to remember there is no pocket, no glow, no vibration of a world that knows where you are. Your clothes look wrong. Not costume-wrong, but *borrowed* wrong, like someone dressed you from memory and got the details almost right.

Ahead, a dirt road curves between fields. A line of people moves along it in the slow, patient way of those who have nowhere else to be. Their carts squeak. A dog trots beside them with ribs showing. On the horizon, a town huddles behind a low timber wall, smoke rising in thin threads as if the place is trying to prove it’s alive.

You need to do three things, immediately:

1) **Not die of thirst or infection.**  
2) **Not get noticed as strange.**  
3) **Not forget what you know.**

You stand, brushing your hands on your thighs, and start walking like you belong on that road.

As you get closer to the town you hear it—metal on metal, the patient ringing of hammer against something hard. A forge, maybe. That’s good. Where there’s a forge, there’s trade. Where there’s trade, there’s information. Information is as close as you’re going to get to a GPS signal.

A woman coming the other way looks you up and down. You force your face into something neutral and tired, the expression that says *I’ve had a long day and no one is interested in my story*. She keeps walking. That feels like a victory.

At the gate, a man with a spear asks you something you can’t understand.

It’s like your language, but not. The bones of it are familiar; the muscles are wrong. Your mind scrambles, trying to map sound to meaning. You swallow and take your best guess.

“Work,” you say, tapping your chest, then making a vague motion toward the town, like you’re indicating an invisible job waiting inside.

The guard squints. His eyes pause on your shoes—or what should be shoes. They’re more like stitched leather, worn down too smooth. He says another sentence, slower this time, and the only word you catch is something like “name.”

You give the first one that comes, because you need *a* name more than you need your own.

“Rowan,” you say.

He repeats it as if tasting it. Then he jerks his head and lets you pass.

Inside, the town is smaller than your brain expects. A cluster of wooden buildings with thatched roofs. Mud between them. Chickens. Children running barefoot, laughing like nothing has ever been invented that could disappoint them. A sour smell from somewhere—tanning pits, maybe. You keep your breathing shallow.

You also keep your eyes down.

It’s not superstition. It’s survival.

A man calling out prices in the square is surrounded by sacks of grain and bundles of dried herbs. There’s no signage. No clocks. No printed anything. Your whole life you’ve been surrounded by words you didn’t even notice—labels, street names, warnings. Here, information lives in people’s mouths and hands. That means you need to attach yourself to a person who has reason to keep you alive.

You spot the forge by the sound. In front of it, a boy pumps a bellows with the steady boredom of someone who has pumped bellows for years. The blacksmith, huge and soot-streaked, glances at you once and sees what everyone sees: a stranger with empty hands.

Empty hands are suspicious.

But empty hands are also cheap.

You walk up, keep your posture humble, and point at the bellows.

“Help,” you say. Then you mimic the pumping motion.

The blacksmith stares. His eyes drift to your face as if he’s reading the shape of you. Then he grunts and jerks his chin.

The boy slides aside. You take his place. The bellows handle is rough wood; it bites your palms. You start pumping.

Immediately you understand the rhythm is everything. Too fast and the fire flares uselessly; too slow and it sulks. You find a middle pace, and the forge brightens, the metal on the anvil taking on a dull, dangerous glow.

The blacksmith nods once. Not approval—assessment.

You keep pumping until your shoulders burn. When he finally waves you off, he tosses you something wrapped in cloth: a heel of bread and a wedge of sharp cheese.

You take it with both hands as if it’s sacred.

It kind of is.

You eat behind the forge, watching people through the gaps in the timber. You listen. Words repeat. Patterns emerge. You don’t learn a language in an hour, but you learn what you need: the sound of coin, the sound of thanks, the sound of trouble.

Trouble is the easiest to recognize.

By late afternoon, you know the town has a name—something like Harth—or maybe that’s the river. You know there’s a lord who collects taxes and a priest who collects secrets. You know outsiders are watched, and sickness is feared in a way you’ve never felt in your clean, sealed life.

And you know you can’t stay here long without becoming someone’s property.

The blacksmith calls you over at dusk, points toward a lean-to behind the forge. Straw on the ground. A blanket that smells like wool and smoke. It’s an offer. Or a test.

You nod, grateful and cautious.

That night, lying on straw, you stare up at the rafters and finally let yourself think the thought you’ve been avoiding:

If you’re stuck here, your knowledge is the only technology you have.

But knowledge can get you killed if you give it to the wrong person.

So you make a plan, small and careful, like building a fire with damp wood.

Tomorrow, you will:

- Find clean water—boiled, if you can convince anyone to do it without sounding insane.  
- Get something like a knife. Not for fighting. For *everything*.  
- Listen for dates without asking for dates: kings’ names, wars, eclipses, plagues.  
- Become useful in ways that seem ordinary.

And then—once you’ve earned a little trust—you will start searching for the one thing you need most:

**a way to leave a message for the future**, or a way to pull the future back to you.

Because the truth settles into you like a second heartbeat:

You didn’t just wake up in a different era.

You woke up in a world that will keep going without you unless you change something.

Outside, the town sleeps. Somewhere a dog barks once and then stops, as if it remembered the rules.

You close your eyes and whisper your name again—your real one this time—so you don’t lose it in the morning.

And in the dark, you realize what you need to do next:

You need to **invent a foothold**—a small, believable miracle—before the era invents a grave for you.
