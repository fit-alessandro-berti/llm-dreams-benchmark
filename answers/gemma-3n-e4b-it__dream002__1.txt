You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air thickens, tasting of ozone and something else… something metallic and ancient. The sunlight, moments before dappling through the leaves, vanishes, swallowed by a swirling grey mass that descends with unnerving speed. 

It’s not just rain. The raindrops are fat, almost too heavy, and shimmer with an unnatural iridescence. The wind, which had been a gentle whisper, now howls through the trees, bending them at impossible angles. Leaves, instead of falling gracefully, are ripped from their branches and flung like tiny, frantic birds.

Panic begins to prickle at the edges of your awareness, but it’s oddly muffled, as if heard through a thick pane of glass. You try to run, but your legs feel heavy, sinking slightly into the soft, damp earth. The forest floor seems to pulsate with a faint, internal light. 

Then you see it.

At the heart of the storm, where the darkness is absolute, a single structure begins to materialize. Not a tree, not a rock – something built. It’s a tower, impossibly tall, crafted from a dark, obsidian-like material. It spirals upwards into the churning clouds, its surface etched with symbols that seem both familiar and utterly alien. They feel… resonant, vibrating against your very bones. 

A low hum emanates from the tower, growing in intensity, and the iridescent rain seems to be drawn towards it, feeding the structure's power. You feel an irresistible pull, a silent invitation to approach.  Fear wars with an intense curiosity, a sense that this tower holds the answer to something profound, something lost.

As you take a hesitant step forward, a single, colossal eye opens at the tower's peak. It’s not a human eye, but something vast and multifaceted, like a polished gemstone reflecting a thousand worlds.  And it seems to be looking *directly at you.* 

The hum intensifies, and a voice, not spoken but *felt*, echoes within your mind.  It’s ancient, weary, and laced with a hint of… longing.  

"You have been summoned," it whispers, the feeling resonating in your core. "The key… the key lies within you."

Then, the iridescent rain intensifies, blinding you, and the ground beneath you begins to tremble. You are drawn, inexorably, towards the tower, towards the eye, towards the terrifying, beckoning promise of… something unknown. 

And just as you reach out a hand… you wake up.
