…and it’s the only thing that *isn’t* changing.

No matter how the sky melts from orange cubes into teal spirals, no matter how the ground flickers between glass, grass, and slow-breathing cloud, the canvas stays still. White. Waiting.

You realize the easel it rests on is made of lines that aren’t there—just the idea of an easel, sketched into reality. When you touch it, your hand passes through, but the canvas feels solid, cool, a little like touching the surface of calm water.

A brush appears in your other hand.

You don’t see it arrive. One moment your fingers are empty; the next, they’re wrapped around a handle made of shifting material: bark, metal, bone, light, back to wood again. The bristles hum softly, like something trying to remember a song.

The colors around you begin to drift closer.

They peel off the sky in slow ribbons, drip from the corners of distant floating shapes, rise out of the ground like mist. Deep violets, neon yellows, gentle pastels you don’t have names for. Each one hovers near the brush tip as if asking to be chosen.

You don’t pick a color. The color picks you.

A small, hesitant streak of blue—somewhere between ocean and bruise—leans in and wraps itself around the bristles. The moment it touches, you feel a memory:

A hallway.
Quiet.
The smell of rain on someone else’s coat.

You lift the brush to the canvas. The blue line appears before you even make contact, a curve that wasn’t there a second ago, as if the painting is slightly ahead of you, already in progress.

You try again.

This time, a warm, golden-orange glides onto the brush like syrup. It feels like:

Laughter through a closed door.
A sunrise you almost slept through.
The exact second you realize you’re not alone.

You swipe it across the canvas. It blooms into a circle, then a door, then a sun, then settles into something in-between—a glowing shape that insists on being both.

You notice something strange: everything you paint, the world echoes.

When you drag a streak of green across the canvas, a hill rises in the distance, unfolding like a yawn. When you dab a cluster of soft, floating pink dots, a breeze carries petals past your face, though there were no trees a moment ago.

The canvas isn’t a picture of the world.
The canvas *is* the world.

You test this.

You paint a small, careful square in the corner—nothing fancy, just a shape with clean edges. As the last line connects, a square doorway blinks into existence a few steps away, hovering in the air at eye level. Through it, you can see… something.

It looks like another place, but it’s blurry, as if someone painted it with water first and then forgot to add detail. You see hints of buildings, maybe. Or mountains. Or books stacked into a city. It keeps changing every time you try to focus.

You glance down at the blank part of the canvas. It somehow feels more urgent now, like silence that wants to be filled.

A thought occurs to you: *What if I paint myself?*

You dip the brush into a shifting silver that feels oddly familiar, like your own reflection. As soon as it touches the bristles, time hiccups. The colors around you freeze mid-sway. Shapes pause in mid-morph.

Carefully, you draw a simple outline: a figure, standing, facing the canvas, holding a brush.

You.

The moment you add the brush in the figure’s hand, you feel a loop snap into place—like closing a bracelet around your wrist. On the painted canvas within the painting, there is another tiny blank canvas. A smaller you. A smaller brush.

You lean closer.

In your painting, the tiny you is also leaning closer to *their* painting, squinting, brush hovering. You can’t quite see what they’re about to do, but you feel a tug, like a soft gravity pulling you inward.

Behind you, the world rustles.

You turn and see that the landscape is now half-finished, half-sketch. On one side, it’s vivid and alive: rivers flowing upward in coils, trees growing leaves made of sound, clouds stitched together with thin golden lines. On the other side, it’s outlines and suggestions, dotted lines waiting to be connected.

It hits you: this place was never done without you.
It was always waiting for your version of it.

You face the canvas again. There’s a small, empty space right in the middle—just big enough for one more thing.

A question arrives, not in words, but in feeling:

*What do you want to add that can’t be taken away, even if everything keeps changing?*

You don’t overthink it. Dream logic won’t stand still long enough for that. You reach for a color you haven’t seen yet—one that doesn’t seem to exist anywhere in the world around you. It rises out of your chest instead, gathering at the tip of the brush.

It’s not quite a color. It’s more like:

The moment before you wake up.
The quiet between heartbeats.
The soft certainty that, somehow, you matter here.

You paint a small, glowing mark—nothing identifiable. Not a shape, not a symbol. Just *your* mark. As soon as it touches the canvas, it spreads everywhere at once:

Into the rivers.
Into the sky.
Into the edges of the distant shifting city.
Into the square doorway.

The world doesn’t stop changing—but now, every change passes through that mark, like light through stained glass. No matter how the scene transforms, you can always spot that echo of yourself, folded into everything.

The square doorway flickers. The blurry world beyond comes into focus for a heartbeat, and you realize with a strange, calm certainty that it’s another place you haven’t visited yet. Another dream. Another version of you, maybe.

The canvas, finally, relaxes. It no longer feels blank, no longer hungry. It feels complete—not because nothing more could be added, but because *you* have added the part only you could.

The brush in your hand dissolves into a cloud of tiny shapes—triangles, stars, question marks—that drift up into the changing sky.

You step toward the square doorway.

Behind you, the painted world keeps shifting, but that small, unnameable mark glows softly in the center of it all, like a signature only you know how to read.

You take a breath that you don’t remember starting.

You step through—

—and as you cross the threshold, the feeling arrives first, just ahead of you:

You are already painting the next place,
even before you see it.
