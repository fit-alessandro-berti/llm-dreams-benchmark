You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air thickens with the scent of ozone and damp earth. Sunlight fractures through the canopy, then vanishes entirely as bruised purple clouds swallow the sky. Thunder rumbles—not distant, but *close*, vibrating in your ribs like a second heartbeat.

You quicken your pace, boots sinking into suddenly spongy moss. Raindrops begin as cold needles on your neck, then swell into a deluge that drums against leaves and slickens the path into a treacherous slide. Lightning forks overhead, bleaching the world bone-white for an instant—and in that flash, you see it: a figure standing perfectly still between two ancient oaks, facing away from you, clad in a cloak the color of storm clouds.

Your breath catches. You weren’t alone.

Before you can call out, the thunder cracks again, shaking the ground. The figure doesn’t turn, but their cloak billows *against* the wind, as if filled from within. Rain streams down your face, blurring your vision, yet you’re drawn forward, compelled. The forest seems to lean in, roots twisting like grasping fingers beneath the mud.

You take a step closer—and the figure raises a hand, not in greeting, but in warning. Palm out. Stillness. In that moment, the rain doesn’t just fall… it *stops*. Not slowly. Instantly. Every drop hangs suspended in the air around you, glittering like a million captive stars. Even the wind holds its breath. The only sound is the frantic pulse in your own ears.

Then, the figure turns.

Their face is smooth, featureless—no eyes, no mouth, just skin like polished river stone. Yet you feel their gaze pierce through you, not with malice, but with ancient, aching sorrow. They point, not at you, but past you, deeper into the woods where the trees grow unnaturally close, their trunks fused into a wall of bark and shadow. A doorway. A mouth.

A single raindrop falls from the suspended sky, landing on your forehead. Cold as memory.

And the storm—*your* storm—begins not in the clouds, but in your chest. You realize with dawning horror:  
**You didn’t walk into the forest to escape the storm.**  
**You walked in to become it.**

The figure dissolves into mist. The raindrops plummet. And the trees part before you, whispering your true name—the one you forgot when you woke up this morning.  

*(You wake with wet hair and thunder in your bones.)*
