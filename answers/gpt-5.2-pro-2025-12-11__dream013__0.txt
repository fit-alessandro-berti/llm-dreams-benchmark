…begin to notice the maze is listening.

At first it’s subtle: the walls seem to lean in when you hesitate, and relax when you commit. Every solved puzzle leaves a faint afterimage in the air—numbers that drift like dust motes, symbols that dissolve into the stone. You tell yourself it’s just the strain of concentration. Then you turn a corner and see a door you’re certain wasn’t there a moment ago, its surface inlaid with a diagram that looks uncannily like your own thoughts: branching, looping, returning to the same question.

The door has no handle. Instead, a shallow bowl is set into the center, and in the bowl a single black marble rests, perfectly still.

A sentence appears across the stone in thin, silver lettering:

**PLACE HERE WHAT YOU TRUST MOST.**

You wait for the catch. The maze has always had one. You look down at your hands and realize they’re empty—no tools, no notes, no chalk dust from the puzzles you’ve been solving. Just your hands, and a quiet sense that whatever you put into the bowl won’t be something you can easily take back.

You think, *I trust logic.*  
But logic feels slippery here, like a ladder that keeps changing its rungs.

You think, *I trust memory.*  
And immediately you can’t recall the first puzzle you solved, only the feeling of solving it.

You think, *I trust myself.*  
And the maze gives a soft, almost amused creak, as if it has been waiting for you to say that.

A second marble appears in the bowl—clear as ice. When you touch it, it’s warm. You understand without understanding: the black marble is the maze’s, the clear one is yours. The puzzle isn’t to choose the right answer. It’s to choose an answer you can live with.

You place the clear marble into the groove around the bowl. The stone shivers. For a moment the wall is transparent, showing corridors stacked like layers of thought, each one a different version of the route you might have taken. You see yourself—many of you—turning left, turning right, stopping, racing, giving up, laughing. Some of them are older. One of them is crying with relief. One of them is still standing at the entrance, hand on the first door, afraid to begin.

The maze is not a place. It’s a decision engine. A mind turned inside out.

The door opens without sound.

Beyond it is a room that doesn’t match the maze at all: a circular chamber lit by a soft gray glow, like morning through fog. In the center stands a table with a single jigsaw puzzle already assembled. It’s an image of the maze from above, complete and orderly, with a red line tracing a path from entrance to center.

Only there is no red line.

There is a blank space where the path should be, as though the maze refuses to declare a correct route.

On the table is a pen.

The puzzle’s last instruction arrives not as text, but as a feeling pressed gently against the inside of your ribs: *You don’t solve this by escaping. You solve it by deciding what it meant.*

You pick up the pen. The tip hovers over the maze-map. Your hand trembles—not from fear of failure, but from the sudden freedom of it. You realize that every puzzle so far has been training you to focus, to infer, to endure uncertainty. The deeper you went, the more the maze stripped away everything except the act of choosing.

You draw a line.

As the ink touches the paper, the chamber exhales. The walls soften. The gray light brightens. The line you draw doesn’t follow the most efficient path; it bends toward rooms you remember only as emotions—curiosity, frustration, stubbornness, wonder. You add a loop where you got lost, not to correct it, but to honor it. You draw straight through a dead end and, in doing so, it stops being dead.

When you lift the pen, the assembled image changes. It is no longer the maze. It is a map of something else—your day, your life, a web of moments connected by the choices you thought were small.

A final doorway appears, simple and unmarked, as if it has always been there.

You walk toward it and, for the first time, you don’t feel the maze behind you as a threat. It feels like a brain finally unclenching. You reach the doorway and pause, palm against the frame.

On the other side you can hear a faint sound: your own breathing, but steadier; a distant voice saying your name in the way someone says it when they want you to wake up gently. You glance back once.

The maze is already rearranging itself, not to trap you again, but to be ready for when you return—because you know, with the strange certainty dreams allow, that you will.

You step through.

And as you wake, the last thing you see is the black marble rolling into the empty bowl, coming to rest beside nothing at all—patient, waiting, as if the maze has learned to trust you back.
