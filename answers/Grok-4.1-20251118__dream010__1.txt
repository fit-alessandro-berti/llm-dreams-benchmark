You are dreaming.

You are participating in a competition where the grand prize is your dream job. As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and obstacles that seem to grow stranger with every round, as if the contest itself is testing not just your skills, but the very fabric of who you are.

The first challenge is straightforward: solve a complex puzzle under time pressure. You do it easily. The crowd cheers. The host, a tall figure whose face keeps flickering like bad reception, smiles too wide and congratulates you.

The second challenge is a debate against an opponent who knows everything you’re about to say before you say it. Literally. They finish your sentences, mock your hesitations, and quote thoughts you haven’t even fully formed yet. You barely scrape through by saying something so absurd, so uncharacteristically vulnerable, that even your own mind didn’t see it coming.

By the third round, the arena has changed. The walls are gone. You’re standing in your childhood bedroom, but everything is slightly off—your old posters are moving, your toys are whispering betting odds on whether you’ll win. The challenge now: convince your younger self not to give up on the dream you’re currently fighting for. Little You sits on the bed, knees pulled to chest, staring at you like you’re a ghost. You cry. They cry. Somehow, you both laugh. You pass.

The fourth challenge has no announcement. You just blink and you’re in the interview room for your dream job. But there’s no interviewer. Only a mirror. The chair across the table is empty. You’re supposed to interview yourself. You ask the hardest questions—the ones you’ve dodged for years. “Why do you deserve this?” “What if you fail?” “Who are you when no one’s watching?” Your reflection answers before you can, brutally honest, sometimes kinder than you’d ever be to yourself. At the end, the reflection stands, walks around the table, and shakes your hand. “You’re hired,” it says. Then it steps into you, and you feel heavier. Whole.

The final challenge begins without fanfare.

The host reappears, but now you recognize the face—it’s yours, older, tired, successful in a way that looks lonely. They smile that same too-wide smile and say:

“Last test. All you have to do… is wake up.”

The arena dissolves. The crowd, the lights, the prizes—everything rushes away like water down a drain.

You’re lying in bed. It’s 3:17 a.m. Your phone is buzzing with an email notification.

The subject line reads: “Congratulations – Offer for [Your Dream Job]”

You stare at the ceiling, heart pounding, not sure if you just won the competition…

…or if the competition was the only thing keeping you asleep long enough to believe you deserved it.

You smile, close your eyes, and let the dream finish its work.

After all, tomorrow you start the job.

Sweet dreams.
