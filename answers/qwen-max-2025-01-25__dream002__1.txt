You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air grows heavy, charged with electricity. The once calm rustling of leaves turns into an urgent whisper as the wind begins to howl through the trees. Dark clouds gather overhead, swallowing the sunlight, casting long shadows across the forest floor.

As you quicken your pace, the first drops of rain fall—cold and sharp against your skin. The path ahead becomes slick with mud, each step more treacherous than the last. Thunder rumbles in the distance, growing louder with every passing second, shaking the ground beneath your feet. Lightning splits the sky, illuminating the towering trees around you like ghostly sentinels.

You spot a faint glow between the trunks up ahead—a small cabin nestled at the edge of a clearing. Relief washes over you as you make your way toward it, dodging low-hanging branches that seem to claw at you in desperation. When you reach the door, it creaks open on its own, revealing warmth from within: a crackling fire in the hearth, a soft blanket draped over a chair, and the scent of pine mingling with something sweet baking nearby.

But just as you step inside, the atmosphere shifts again. The fire flickers unnaturally, casting strange shapes on the walls. Shadows move where they shouldn’t, twisting into forms both familiar and alien. A voice echoes softly, neither male nor female, calling your name—not aloud, but directly in your mind.

“Why have you come here?” it asks.

You turn to leave, but the door has vanished. The room seems smaller now, closing in around you. Yet amidst the growing unease, there’s also curiosity pulling you forward. What lies beyond this place? Who—or what—is waiting for you?

And then, everything goes silent. Even the storm outside ceases its fury. In that stillness, you realize this isn’t just any dream—it’s a journey, one that will test not only your courage but also your understanding of reality itself. 

What do you do next?
