…feel a tightening in your chest as everyone in the office seems to fall silent, their eyes on you. The desk before you is suddenly piled high with papers that seem to shift and rearrange themselves every time you glance away. Your boss doesn’t speak—just stands there expectantly, eyes unblinking, as though waiting for you to perform a trick instead of actual work.  

You open your laptop, but instead of your usual programs, the screen flickers with cascading lines of glowing symbols you don’t recognize. Strangely, you feel you *should* understand them. When you touch the keyboard, the symbols scatter and reform into something resembling a map—not of streets, but of shifting hallways you realize belong to your workplace itself. The building feels alive, corridors extending and folding in on themselves, as if the project isn’t to produce a report at all, but to navigate this labyrinth that reflects the tangled pressures inside your own head.  

You rise from your chair and notice the office walls bending at impossible angles. Some coworkers drift away into the corridors like shadows, carrying fragments of paper that glow faintly in their hands. You have the sense that these fragments are pieces of the “project”—and if you can collect them, perhaps the impossible task will resolve itself.  

You take a step toward the nearest hallway, but it stretches away like a tunnel of mirrors, each reflection of yourself older, younger, or entirely unfamiliar. Your boss’s voice echoes from behind you—not words, but the sound of expectation itself, a hum that pushes you forward.  

Would you like me to continue the dream as a surreal journey through this labyrinth, or would you prefer it to shift toward something more comforting and resolute, like the discovery of control or escape?
