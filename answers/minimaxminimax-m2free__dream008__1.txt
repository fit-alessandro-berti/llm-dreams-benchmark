You sit down and you are suddenly standing. The ceiling is higher than it was this morning. Your keyboard is a lake. A clock on the wall ticks sideways, and the second hand is made of silver thread, tugging somewhere behind your ears.

Andrea pushes a folder that is breathing. It is mint green and it smells like rain. “Just make it sing,” she says, and she smiles in that way you can never quite disprove is kindness.

The folder flips itself open. Inside is a blank page that remembers you. In the margin, your handwriting from yesterday says: remember the elevator pitch we practiced for the meeting we already had. The margins widen, absorbing the sound of the coffee machine, the hum of the server room. The lights dim and there’s a tiny brass bell on your desk you didn’t put there.

You look at the time. The display says 2:43 AM, then 7:58 PM, then a question mark. Somewhere down the corridor, someone laughs like a dial tone.

You breathe and the clock listens. The doorbell of your memory rings. You remember the project file you opened before you forgot to save it. You remember an email you sent to a version of yourself who hasn’t been born yet, apologizing. Your phone vibrates; the lockscreen is a sunflower field in a hurricane.

Outside your cubicle, someone passes a coat made of layered spreadsheets; in their pocket, a hamster sleeps inside a glass spinning top labeled Compliance.

Andrea clears her throat softly, like a question answered politely too late. “How long?” she says, without saying it. The folder makes a small sound, like a mouth being asked to stay closed.

You realize you don’t know what to build. You know exactly what to build. You have exactly thirteen seconds to invent it, and forty-seven minutes to finish it, and you have never had an idea this big and this heavy and this small at once.

On your screen, a window opens named Untitled and inside it is a door, a real door with paint in the grain of the wood and a key that will open anything except the point. The door has a handrail that keeps offering you the next step up the world. You pull your chair closer and the chair disappears, leaving only the promise of sitting.

You begin. You write:

Project Name: Motion Under Question Mark
Description: To build a thing that moves people so far sideways they arrive somewhere honest.

Objectives:
1. Reframe the impossible as a shape we can fit our bodies into.
2. Borrow time from the future and pay it back in this one, with interest.
3. Leave a little dog park inside every slide.

Andrea’s reflection in your second monitor turns away and then toward you, unsure whether to approve or blink. She says, “Good,” without moving her lips.

You look at your desk lamp; it is pretending to be a lighthouse. On the edge of your paper, a coffee ring shapes itself into a perfect circle, then asks to be invited to your meeting. You mark it down as an attendee and everyone loves her.

On Slack, your coworker Marina sends you a hand-drawn blueprint of a blender that mixes pride with deadlines and then spills a little universe onto the counter. You put the universe under your keyboard like a small rug.

You stand up and fall into the elevator, which feels like being held by a hand made of sound. The elevator stops at a floor labeled Somewhere Then. You walk through a hallway lined with doors labeled Password, where a doormat politely begs for the password you wish you remembered. Behind a door labeled The Idea That Will Find You, you hear a typewriter typing itself and a dog snoring in two-part harmony.

You go back, because the elevator left you a note that reads: Start there when you’re there. You arrive back in your chair that has returned from the void and is ready to be sat in.

You write more. You write about the map hidden in the mislabeled files, about the stack of tiny fake phones on the table that ring when you need courage. You write the sentence you always wanted to say and you say it now in the correct order. You say the other one and swallow it before anyone else can taste it.

You close your eyes and imagine Andrea arriving with a cake that’s a spreadsheet. The boss cuts a piece with a credit card. Everyone laughs but also they cry because sometimes even cost centers can hold poems.

Time holds its breath long enough for you to attach the wrong document, which opens with the right apology and the right number, and even though the title is wrong, the photo inside is exactly yours, taken from a mirror facing east.

The folder closes, but only half. The blank page looks at you and you look at it and the two of you know that the work is done and also that the work will be done again tomorrow by someone who is you and also someone who is not.

Andrea stands up and sits down without moving, the way bosses do when a chair refuses to be used. “Ship it,” she says, and then she stops and then she says, “Let it go,” and then the air in the room changes and the fish tank on the wall has always been empty and now the water feels relieved.

You push the send button that is also a door. The email travels like a train that was waiting for you to become a station. On the dashboard, you switch your status from Nightmare to Lunch.

In the distance, the hamster in the spinning top runs faster and the clock slouches back into a normal shape. The coffee ring raises its hand to make a proposal. You shake it. The room applauds, lightly, like rain on a window that is also a screen.

When you walk to the lobby, the hallway is a hundred years long and then only three steps, and you pass the elevator that promises nothing and keeps it beautifully.

The doors slide open. Outside the building, a person with your face is juggling flaming arrows labeled Policy. They nod and you nod back. Somewhere inside your pocket is a stone that is a key. Somewhere inside your throat is a speech that wants to be a handshake. Somewhere inside your dream you are at your desk again, making sure the second person in every sentence knows they were always invited.
