...and each challenge strips away another certainty you thought you had.

The first challenge is a maze whose walls are pages of your old notebooks. They whisper critiques and forgotten ideas; every turn forces you to choose whose voice you’ll honor. You find yourself ripping out a page — not destroying it, but folding it into a paper plane and letting it fly. It arcs straight toward a small window that opens onto a skyline of impossible machines: elevators that run on laughter, cranes that build with colored sunlight.

Next, you give a presentation to an audience made of silhouettes—colleagues you've never met, mentors who died years ago, a younger you sitting cross-legged at the front, scribbling notes. Mid-sentence the lights go out and the only illumination is a single filament of thought in your head. You speak by feeling instead of rehearsing, and when the lights return the silhouettes are nodding.

You are assigned to repair a clock that keeps losing minutes whenever you hesitate. As you work, the gears demand a confession: what are you afraid of losing if you get the job? Time, you admit, and the clock softens; its hands slow to a steady comfort, not frantic speed. In another round you’re asked to cook a dish that tastes like the last compliment you ever received. You search memory, find the ingredients, and feed strangers — who become your allies — a spoonful that turns their faces toward you in recognition.

Rules change mid-round. Judges become collaborators; judges become children; children become weather. A puzzle asks you to map the moral of a story you haven’t lived yet. You realize the solution isn’t cleverness but empathy: you must rearrange tiles to show not what you would do, but what someone else needs. The game rewards choices that build something larger than you.

Near the end there is a door with no handle. On the other side, you imagine your dream job waiting like a perfectly set table. A voice — yours, older and calmer — asks you to cross a threshold but warns: the prize will require you to give up a small certainty, one habitual comfort that has kept you safe. With a last look at the maze, the clock, the audience, the alley of paper planes, you unlace one safety: the quiet permission to always choose comfort over risk. You open the door.

The grand prize is handed to you in an ordinary envelope that smells of rain and printer ink. Inside is not only a job offer but an invitation: an office where the windows face the sea, coworkers who teach as much as they ask, and a blank wall waiting for the projects you will invent. There’s also a note, scribbled in your own handwriting: "Make room for others."

You accept. The victory is not a triumphant trumpet but a beginning: the competition dissolves into daily work, into decisions made in meeting rooms and at kitchen tables, into small acts of courage that feel suspiciously like ordinary life. You wake up — or perhaps the waking is another stage — to sunlight on your ceiling and the soft ping of an email. The subject line reads, Welcome aboard. Your hands tremble not from fear but from the remembered maze, and you smile because you now know the prize was always more than a title. It was the permission to build a job that contains room for the people you left in the maze, and the courage to invite them in.
