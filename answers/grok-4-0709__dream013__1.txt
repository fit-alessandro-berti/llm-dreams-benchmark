...and as you move deeper into the maze, you notice the walls shifting like living vines, whispering riddles in forgotten languages. The air grows thicker, scented with the metallic tang of rain-soaked earth, and your footsteps echo not on stone, but on what feels like the fragile membrane of forgotten memories. Each puzzle you solve—a labyrinth of gears that only turn when you recall a childhood fear, or a mirror that reflects not your face but the faces of people you've lost—unlocks a door, but it also unlocks something inside you. Doubts. Desires. Secrets you didn't know you kept.

Deeper still, the maze begins to pulse with a heartbeat that's not your own. You encounter a shadowy figure at a crossroads, a version of yourself from a parallel life, dressed in clothes you've never worn, offering a choice: solve the final puzzle, a enigma woven from threads of time itself, or turn back and forget it all. But as you reach out to grasp the threads, they tangle around your fingers, pulling you into a whirl of colors—crimson regrets, sapphire hopes, emerald envies—spinning faster and faster until the maze dissolves into a vast, starry void.

There, floating weightless, you realize the true puzzle was never the maze; it was you. And just as understanding dawns, a gentle chime rings out, like the alarm clock of the universe, and you feel yourself being tugged back to wakefulness. But wait— is that the exit, or just another layer of the dream? You open your eyes... or do you?
