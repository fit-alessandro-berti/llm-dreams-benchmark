You feel lost in the cityâ€™s chaotic energy, clutching your coat and a map in hand. The streets are packed with footsteps, and your heart feels like itâ€™s racing from nowhere to where it needs to go. A group of strangers steps into your path, their smiles warm as they offer to lead you through the maze. They whisper a word that makes your path clear, and you realize, finally, that sometimes the cityâ€™s pulse is the only constant. You walk with them, feeling more at home, and their presence becomes a reminder that even in the storm, thereâ€™s light. ðŸŒŸ
