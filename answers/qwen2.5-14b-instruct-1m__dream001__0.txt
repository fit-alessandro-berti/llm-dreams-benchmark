wake up disoriented, your heart racing as you try to orient yourself within the towering skyscrapers that stretch endlessly into the sky. The streets below are bustling with people, but none seem to be in any hurry except for you. You glance at your watch—only 45 minutes until the meeting, and still no clue where it’s taking place.

The city feels both familiar and alien, like a place you’ve visited before but can’t quite remember. The buildings are made of glass and steel, reflecting the neon lights that flicker on and off, casting eerie shadows. You spot a large, ornate clock tower in the distance, its hands moving too slowly, as if time itself is conspiring against you.

You approach a street vendor selling maps, but when you reach out to grab one, they disappear into thin air. Frustrated, you turn to a passerby, but instead of offering help, they just walk past, lost in their own world. Panic starts to set in. You pull out your phone, but the screen is blank—no signal, no battery.

Just as you’re about to give up, you notice a small, unassuming café tucked between two massive buildings. The sign above the door reads "The Blue Compass." Inside, the air is warm and inviting, and the walls are lined with shelves full of old books and maps. A man sitting by the window catches your eye—he’s reading a thick leather-bound book, his eyes scanning the pages intently.

You sit down beside him, and without looking up, he says, “Lost, aren’t you?”

“Yeah,” you reply, “I’m supposed to meet someone, but I have no idea where.”

He closes the book and looks at you, his eyes sharp and knowing. “Sometimes, the destination isn’t what matters. It’s the journey that leads you there.”

Before you can respond, he gestures to the map on the table in front of him. It’s not a typical map—it’s a living, breathing thing, with rivers that pulse and mountains that shift. He points to a small, glowing dot on the map. “Go there,” he says simply.

You hesitate, glancing at your watch again. Time is slipping away, but something about the man’s calm demeanor reassures you. You take the map and leave the café, feeling a strange sense of certainty. The streets seem to part for you as you walk, leading you toward the glowing dot on the map.

As you get closer, the city begins to change around you. The towering buildings shrink, and the crowds thin out. You find yourself in a quiet, tree-lined park, where a large, open-air pavilion stands at the center. Inside, a group of people are waiting—some you recognize, some you don’t. At the head of the table is the person you were meant to meet, smiling warmly.

You take a deep breath and step inside. The meeting begins, and as you look around the room, you realize this wasn’t just about the destination—it was about the path that led you here, and the unexpected encounters along the way.
