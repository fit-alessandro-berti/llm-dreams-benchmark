The blank canvas whispers in a language I somehow understand without words, telling me it contains every painting that has never been painted. When I blink, I'm suddenly *inside* the canvas, standing in a vast white space where my thoughts bloom into existence as tangible objects - a memory of rain becomes silver threads falling upward, the feeling of Tuesday transforms into a spiral staircase that smells like cinnamon.

Someone's nightmare drips purple from above, but when it touches my space, it becomes a garden of crystalline flowers that sing in harmonious frequencies.

I realize I'm holding a brush that's actually a key, or maybe it's both at once, and every stroke I make opens a door to another dreamer's canvas. Through one door, I glimpse an ocean of clockwork fish swimming through clouds of mathematical equations.
