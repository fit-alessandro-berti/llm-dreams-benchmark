…walk away.

Not out of victory, not out of surrender—just out of a sudden, overwhelming sense that the words have turned into sharp, useless things.

Your friend’s mouth is still moving, but the sound drops out, like someone dragging the volume slider to zero. Their expression twists in slow motion, syllables stranded behind their teeth. The room you’re in—was it your kitchen, their living room, a hallway?—can’t seem to decide. The walls breathe once, inhaling wallpaper, exhaling cracked plaster.

You feel an odd calm. “This isn’t right,” you say, though you’re not sure if you mean the fight or the physics.

You step toward the door that wasn’t there a second ago.

“Don’t walk away,” your friend mouths silently, eyes wide now. There’s a flicker of hurt, then fear, then something that looks eerily like relief.

You hesitate, hand hovering over a doorknob that looks exactly like the one from your childhood bedroom. The metal is warm, like someone has just let go of it from the other side.

Your chest tightens. You realize you can’t recall how the argument started. You know it mattered deeply—something about trust, or loyalty, or the way they’d changed, or the way you had. But every time you reach for the exact words, your mind coughs up smoke instead.

You glance back at your friend.

For a second, their face glitches, cycling through every age you’ve known them: younger, older, laughing, furious, crying, indifferent. It’s unnerving, like watching a deck of faces being thumbed through by an unseen hand.

“This is about you,” all of those versions seem to say at once, without sound.

You turn the knob.

The door opens onto a train platform at night.

Cold air spills up to meet you. You step through and you’re there, somehow mid-conversation with the echo of the fight you just left. Your friend is now sitting on a bench down the platform, head in hands, same clothes, same wounded posture—only their outline flickers, like bad reception.

A train light burns toward you from the tunnel, bright and distant. An announcement plays overhead in a language you should recognize but can’t. It melts into a long, steady hum.

You decide to walk down the yellow line, parallel to the tracks, away from your friend, just to see what happens if you refuse to fix it this time—if you choose distance over reconciliation.

With each step:

- The tiles beneath your feet become glossy hardwood.
- The hum of the train morphs into the low murmur of a crowd.
- The overhead lamps stretch taller, then twist into bare tree branches full of hanging bulbs.

You’re now walking down the aisle at some kind of gathering—part wedding, part courtroom, part classroom. Every chair is filled with people you’ve known: family, exes, coworkers, strangers you’re sure you’ve only passed once on the street. All of them are watching you like they’re waiting for a verdict.

At the front, where an altar should be, your friend stands behind a podium.

Their eyes are red, but they’re calm now.

“The thing about you,” they say—finally audible, voice clear and echoing—“is you always leave before the part that hurts enough to change you.”

You try to object, but when you open your mouth, sand pours out. Words disintegrate on your tongue. A few grains glitter like tiny glass shards as they fall.

You feel panic spike.

You look down: your phone is in your hand. You don’t remember taking it out. On the screen is the last message you never sent them—the honest one, the one that would’ve admitted your fear, your fault, that you actually cared more than your jokes and deflections ever suggested.

You decide to press send.

Your thumb moves in the syrupy slowness of dreams. When it finally taps the button, the screen doesn’t show “Sent.” It fractures like ice, then ripples, then blooms into a completely different image:

You and your friend, laughing, on a day that hasn’t happened yet.

They’re older. So are you. There is no trace of this fight on their face, only a familiarity that says: we made it past that part.

The image feels warm, unbearably so, like standing in sunlight with your eyes closed.

You look up from the phone. The crowd is gone. The podium is gone. You’re back on the train platform. Just you and your friend.

The train is arriving now, air rushing, brakes shrieking.

Your friend looks at you, raw, real, no flickering.

“So,” they say, as if you’ve both just shouted for ten minutes and finally reached the real question. “Are you going to walk away again, or are we going to talk for real this time?”

You realize you are balancing on the thin line between departure and return, between repeating the pattern and changing it.

You feel the pull: it’s easier to wake up than to answer.

But you decide to—

(And just as you make that choice, you feel the dream tipping, as if your answer is what will either open your eyes…or open your mouth.)
