You scramble to your feet on rough-hewn boards and realize with a jolt that every trace of the twenty‑first century is gone. No hum of electricity, no hum of engines—only the crackle of a hearth fire outside your chamber door. The sky beyond the narrow window is pale with dawn; the air smells of woodsmoke and wet earth. As you step into the hall, rough wooden beams frame that single thought pounding in your head:

You need to survive—and find a way home.

First, you must blend in.

•  Clothing & Appearance  
  A coarse wool tunic hangs on a peg. You tug it on, wincing at the scratch of the fibers against your skin. A pair of simple leather shoes lies by the door—worn but serviceable. No smartphones to light your path; your only tool now is your wits.

•  Food & Water  
  In the courtyard, a shepherdess fills a clay pitcher at the well. You join her, pretending confidence. Water is your first conquest—then you slip into the bakehouse to trade a few coppers you miraculously find in your pocket for a hunk of day‑old bread.

•  Speech & Customs  
  Voices rise in a dialect that dances just out of reach. You listen for stock phrases—“Good morrow,” “God keep you,” “barter,” “guild”—and copy them until your own speech feels right. Every misstep marks you as an outsider.

•  Allies & Information  
  At the tavern table under a flickering lantern, you eavesdrop on guards swapping rumors: “Strange healer in the woods,” “merchant caravan to the east,” “old scholar at the abbey who reads forbidden scrolls.” One name stands out—Sister Aldine, rumored to know secrets of time and fate.  

•  A Quest Emerges  
  If you are to return to your era, you’ll need guidance—perhaps even magic. But the scholar demands a price: a rare herb that blooms only at moonrise, deep in the forest known for wolves.  

You tuck the bread under your tunic, tighten the straps on your leather shoes, and set your jaw. Dawn’s light touches the ramparts, and you step through the gate, heading toward the ancient trees. The path will be dangerous, but every mile brings you closer to Sister Aldine—and to the one final discovery that might break the boundary between centuries.

As the last tendrils of modern memory fade into your racing heartbeat, you realize: adaptation is your only weapon—and courage your only guide home.
