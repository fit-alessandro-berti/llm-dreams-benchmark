You start to frantically check your pockets for a clue—a crumpled note, a business card, anything—but find only a faded train ticket with no destination. The streets around you ripple, neon signs melting into gibberish as you sprint past. A crowd of faceless commuters parts around you, murmuring in a language that shifts between familiarity and nonsense. Your phone buzzes incessantly, but the map app shows only a pulsing red dot labeled *YOU ARE HERE*, surrounded by spiraling, Escher-like streets. 

A clocktower chimes, its hands spinning backward. Panic tightens your chest until a stray cat darts across your path, tail flicking toward an alley where a door glows faintly. Inside, an elevator awaits, its buttons marked with symbols: a teacup, an eye, a chess knight. You press one at random. The doors open to a rooftop garden where a figure in a cobalt suit gestures to a bridge made of light arching over the city. “They’re waiting,” they say, voice echoing like wind through tunnels. 

As you step onto the bridge, the city folds inward, towers collapsing like origami. The meeting room materializes—a glass orb floating above an abyss. Inside, silhouettes turn toward you, but their words are swallowed by the roar of an unseen ocean. You reach for the door handle, only to wake with a jolt, the taste of saltwater and the echo of a chime lingering in the air.
