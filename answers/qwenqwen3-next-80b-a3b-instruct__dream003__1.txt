You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and symbols etched into its surface—each one glowing faintly, like veins of bioluminescent moss beneath polished obsidian. The patterns shift when you blink, rearranging into new constellations of geometries that hum in a language older than memory.

You reach out—just to touch it—and the moment your fingertip brushes the cold metal, the box *breathes*.

A whisper coils around your mind, not in words, but in feeling:  
*“To open me, you must give what you least want to lose.”*

You hesitate. The box begins to warm. A soft chime echoes—once, twice—like a heartbeat in reverse.

Behind you, the dream landscape shimmers. You see your childhood home, the smell of rain on old wood. Your mother’s laugh. A letter you never sent. A song you played for someone who left. These are the things you thought you’d buried, but now they’re blooming like orchids from the floor.

A voice—not yours—whispers again:  
*“You don’t need a key. You need a choice.”*

You close your eyes. And without thinking, you offer up something your waking self would never admit to clinging to:  
Your fear of being forgotten.

The box releases a sigh. The patterns flare—gold, then violet, then the quiet blue of twilight—and the seams melt open like wax.

Inside is not gold, nor jewels, nor secrets.

It’s a mirror.

And in it—you see yourself, younger, softer, with eyes full of wonder… holding a small, unopened gift.

You reach for it.

The dream does not end.

It waits.

Because you still have to open it.
