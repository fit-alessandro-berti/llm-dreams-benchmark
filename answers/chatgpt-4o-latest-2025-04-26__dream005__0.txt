and each group feels like stepping into a different little world. 

The first group you pass is clustered around a grand piano. Laughter spills out like music itself, and someone with glittering eyes calls you over as if they’ve known you forever. But when you move closer, they suddenly all turn away, as if forgetting you were ever there.

You continue weaving through the crowd. The next group is seated in a circle on the floor, whispering secrets into cupped hands. Every time you try to listen, their words swirl into a language you almost—but don’t quite—understand, like trying to remember a song from a dream.

Growing more anxious, you spot a tall doorway draped with golden cloth. Inside, people are dancing slowly, dreamily, and the air smells like oranges and smoke. You're drawn in without thinking, the music pulling at your chest like a tide.

Then, across the room, you finally glimpse the person you know—only they look different somehow. Their hair is longer, their eyes shine a strange silver, and when they smile, it feels both comforting and a little unsettling. They beckon you over with a slow hand gesture.

As you step toward them, the floor beneath your feet softens, like walking on clouds, and suddenly the walls of the gathering melt away into a vast, starlit field. 

The person speaks at last, but their voice echoes with two tones—one you recognize, and one completely foreign.

They say, "You found me... but do you remember why you were looking?"
