You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air grows heavy with electricity. The once-gentle breeze transforms into gusting winds that bend the treetops. Leaves swirl around you in chaotic patterns as the sky darkens to an ominous purple-gray.

You seek shelter, spotting a curious stone structure ahead—perhaps an abandoned cottage or shrine. As raindrops begin to fall, you rush toward it, your footsteps cushioned by the forest floor. The structure reveals itself to be an ancient circular stone chamber, its roof partially open to the sky but offering enough protection from the coming deluge.

Inside, strange symbols are carved into the walls, faintly glowing with a blue luminescence that intensifies with each lightning strike. The air feels different here—thinner somehow, as if the boundary between worlds has worn thin.

As thunder crashes overhead, the symbols pulse in rhythm with the storm. You feel drawn to place your palm against a central spiral carving. The moment your skin makes contact, the storm outside freezes—raindrops suspended in mid-air, lightning paused in its jagged descent.

A voice that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere whispers: "You have awakened the forest's memory. What would you like to see?"

Before you can answer, the stone beneath your feet becomes transparent, revealing not earth but stars—as if you're standing on a window looking into the cosmos itself. The dream-logic tells you that you must choose: step back into the storm and return to the world you know, or step forward onto the stars and discover what lies beyond the veil of your understanding.
