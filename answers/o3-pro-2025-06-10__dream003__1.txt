…symmetrical grooves that resemble miniature constellations hammered into the metal.  
When you brush your fingertip across one of the star-shaped hollows, the pattern flickers to life, glowing a dim indigo. A gentle hum – more felt than heard – radiates through your palm, and the air turns velvety, as though the night sky itself has folded in around you.

The constellations rearrange beneath your touch until they become a spiral. Instinct tells you to spin the box. You do, and the etchings move like gears: the lid rotates a quarter turn with a soft click even though there is still no hinge, no seam, no keyhole.

A voice, neither male nor female, tumbles out of the humming:  
“Puzzle of nine, truth of one. Remember.”

Nine? You look again. Nine glowing stars now pulse atop the lid, arranged in a circle. Each shines a different hue:

1. Crimson, like sunrise through closed eyelids.  
2. Amber, warm as candle wax.  
3. Gold, sharp as brass.  
4. Emerald, whispering of moss.  
5. Teal, cool and briny.  
6. Sapphire, heavy with rain.  
7. Violet, smelling faintly of lavender.  
8. Silver, ringing like clear bells.  
9. Obsidian, silent and light-swallowing.

Your dream logic supplies a rule you somehow already know: touch the stars in the order of a memory that feels truest. You close your eyes and let memories flicker:

• A red bicycle you outgrew.  
• The smell of baking bread at dawn.  
• School trophies glinting under gym lights.  
• A forest cabin covered in summer vines.  
• An ocean vacation where you tasted salt on your lips.  
• A thunderstorm you watched from a porch swing.  
• Lavender fields behind a cousin’s farm.  
• A wind-chime dancing at midnight.  
• A blackout when the only light was your own heartbeat.

You open your eyes and tap the stars accordingly. With every press, the color bursts upward in a thin beam, painting the darkness. On the ninth touch, the beams braid together overhead, forming a translucent key made entirely of woven light. It drifts down, but instead of entering a lock, it dissolves into your chest. The box lid vanishes, revealing no treasure—only a mirrored interior that reflects not your face, but your younger self, eyes wide, holding a small origami crane.

The crane flutters its paper wings, turns to smoke, and becomes a final line of text hovering above the empty box:

“YOU ARE THE KEY.”

At that moment the dream ripples, the box, the stars, the mirrored child all folding inward like an origami universe returning to a single sheet. You feel a gentle snap—like solving the last step of a puzzle—and wake with your hands closed around nothing, yet still warm with indigo light that fades as the morning arrives.
