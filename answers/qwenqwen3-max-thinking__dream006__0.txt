...panic. Your throat tightens. The index cards you’d prepared—your lifeline—are gone. Vanished. You pat your pockets frantically, but they’re empty except for a single smooth river stone you don’t remember picking up.  

The spotlight burns your eyes, and the silence stretches like taffy. Someone coughs. A child whispers, “Is he okay?”  

Then, a miracle: the stone in your palm grows warm. You look down, and words begin to glow across its surface—*not yours*, but ancient, shimmering script that rearranges itself as you breathe. You hold it up, trembling, and the audience leans forward, not in judgment, but in shared wonder.  

The words aren’t spoken—they’re *felt*. They bloom in the air like ink in water, forming constellations above the crowd. People gasp as their own memories surface in the patterns: a grandmother’s lullaby, the scent of rain on dry earth, the exact blue of a childhood bicycle.  

You realize you’re not giving a speech.  
You’re holding up a mirror.  
And the dream isn’t yours alone anymore—it’s theirs too.  

The stone dissolves into fireflies. The crowd doesn’t applaud. They close their eyes, smiling, as if remembering something they’d forgotten they knew.  

You wake with the taste of starlight on your tongue.
