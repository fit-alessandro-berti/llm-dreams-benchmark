...each group seems to be engaged in a different, surreal activity. In one corner, a circle of people is floating just above the ground, their laughter creating ripples in the air like water. Another group is painting with colors that don’t exist in the waking world, their canvases shifting and morphing into landscapes you’ve never seen but somehow recognize. You feel a pull toward a table where people are sharing stories, but their words come out as glowing, three-dimensional shapes that hover in the air before dissolving into the ether.

As you weave through the crowd, you catch glimpses of your friend—a flash of their familiar coat, the sound of their voice—but each time you get closer, they dissolve into the crowd or transform into someone else entirely. Frustration bubbles up, but it’s tempered by the strangeness of the dream, as if the rules of reality have been suspended and you’re meant to enjoy the journey rather than the destination.

Then, you notice a door at the edge of the room, slightly ajar, with golden light spilling out. You feel an inexplicable certainty that your friend is behind it. As you approach, the noise of the gathering fades, replaced by a soothing hum. You push the door open, and there they are, sitting calmly in a serene, sunlit garden. They smile at you as if they’ve been waiting all along.

“Took you long enough,” they say, but their tone is warm. You sit beside them, and the garden begins to shift around you—blossoming flowers, flowing streams, trees that grow and change shape in moments. You realize you’re no longer searching, and the dream settles into a peaceful, endless now.
