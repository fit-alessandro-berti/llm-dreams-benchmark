You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to **stumble through the fog-draped streets**, the air thick with the smell of ozone and something sweet, like burnt sugar. The buildings around you are alive—glass spires that shimmer like liquid mercury, bridges that twist into spirals, and doorways that blink in and out of existence. The sky is a kaleidoscope of shifting colors, and the ground beneath you feels both solid and liquid, as if the city is breathing. 

A clock tower looms in the distance, its hands moving backward. You rush, but the path ahead splits into three directions, each marked by a glowing symbol: a key, a star, and a shadow. You follow the star, drawn by its golden glow, but as you near it, the street morphs into a mirror, reflecting not your face, but a version of yourself—**older, with a crown of thorns**, rushing in the opposite direction. You freeze. 

A voice whispers, **"The meeting is a test. The city will decide which path you’re worthy of."** You turn, and a figure materializes from the mist: a woman with eyes like shattered glass, wearing a cloak that shifts between raincoat and wings. She says, **"The meeting is not in this city. It’s in your mind. But to get there, you must forget."** 

You hesitate, but the clock tower’s hands snap forward, ticking backward to **12:00**. The mirror street collapses into a labyrinth of memory—your childhood home, your first love’s laughter, a moment you’ve forgotten. You run, and the labyrinth reshapes itself, each turn a memory you’ve buried. 

In the center, a door opens into a void. Beyond it is a room with a single chair, and a man in a suit that’s half your own, half a stranger’s. He says, **"You were supposed to meet here. The city took your memories to distract you. Now, you must choose: stay in the dream, or wake up knowing the truth."** 

You wake up screaming, your hands gripping your head. The clock is gone. The meeting is tomorrow. But in your palm, you feel a small, glowing key.
