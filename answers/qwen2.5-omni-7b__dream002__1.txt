The wind picks up, causing leaves to rustle and branches to sway. The sky darkens as clouds gather overhead, and lightning flashes across the horizon. Thunder rumbles in the distance, growing louder with each passing moment.

As the storm intensifies, you notice that the trees around you begin to glow faintly, their bark shimmering with an otherworldly light. The air becomes thick and heavy, making it difficult to breathe. You can hear the sound of raindrops falling from above, but they never reach the ground.

Suddenly, a figure emerges from the darkness, standing before you. It is tall and imposing, with long hair flowing down its back like a waterfall. Its eyes burn with an intense flame, and its mouth is agape, revealing sharp teeth.

"You have come too far," the figure says, its voice echoing through the forest. "You cannot escape this storm."

Before you can react, the figure lunges forward, its hand reaching out towards you. But just as it touches your skin, everything fades away into nothingness. When you open your eyes again, you find yourself back in the peaceful forest, the storm gone and the glowing trees still standing.

But something feels different now. As you walk away from the scene, you can't shake the feeling that what happened was real, even though you know it wasn't. And every time you close your eyes, you see the figure's face, its burning eyes staring at you, waiting for you to return.
