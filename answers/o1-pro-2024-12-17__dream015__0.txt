…push onward through the cracked remnants of an old city, determined to find some remnant of human hope. Your feet scrape over jagged asphalt and broken glass. Buildings stand like hollowed-out shells, windows shattered, weeds and moss coiling through collapsed doorways. Overhead, a sky of sullen gray swirls with dust and ash, blotting out any hint of the sun. The wind tastes like rust and old secrets.

You carry a makeshift pack on your shoulders—stitched together from tarps and rope you scavenged weeks ago—inside it, a handful of canned beans, a dented metal water bottle, and a battered hand-crank radio. The radio rarely picks up anything but static, but you keep it close like a talisman. Sometimes, when the nights are quiet and the wind dies down, you think you hear faint voices, human voices, as if someone else out there is holding on, just as you are.

Your next goal: find a safe place to spend the night. You can’t afford another ambush by feral dogs or desperate survivors who’ve turned to violence. You scan the street, eyes caught by a half-collapsed billboard advertising a long-gone holiday sale. The building beneath it might have a basement or at least an intact corner where you can wedge yourself in until dawn.

You approach cautiously, senses attuned to every crunch underfoot. The sound of your breathing is heavy in your ears. Suddenly, you hear it—a soft whimper, a rustle of movement inside the building’s skeleton. Your heart tenses. You’re not sure what to expect: another scavenger? A wounded animal? Something worse?

You edge closer, skirting a pile of twisted metal. Light filters through fractured beams, illuminating a corner where a figure huddles. A young girl, maybe twelve or thirteen, her hair tangled and face smeared with soot. She looks up, frightened. She doesn’t speak, just clutches a shard of mirror as if it were a weapon. In that mirrored fragment, you see your own reflection: hollow cheeks, weary eyes, the set of your jaw that you’ve seen in too many dirty puddles.

You raise your hands, palms open, no threat. You consider offering her something: a can of beans or a swallow of water. But these resources are precious. Then you remember why you’re still going—what you decided at the start of this nightmare. You said you’d keep going despite the hardships. But for what? To survive alone? Or to carry on something better than survival?

Carefully, you lower yourself to a crouch, meeting her eyes. “Hey,” you whisper, voice echoing in the hollow ruin. “It’s okay. I won’t hurt you.” She watches you, unblinking, knuckles white around her fragment of glass.

You ease the pack from your shoulder and open it slowly, making no sudden moves. Your heart sinks at the thought of losing precious calories, but what is the point of hoarding them if you can’t share them with another living soul? You roll a can of beans gently towards her. Its rattle in the silence sounds loud as thunder.

She flinches, then reaches out with trembling fingers. She tests the can’s solidity. Her eyes flick up to you, unsure but curious. You smile, or at least try to—your lips feel cracked and stiff from disuse.

Slowly, very slowly, she sets down the shard of mirror. As if acknowledging a truce, she nudges a patch of fabric your way. It’s an old scarf, faded with time, but whole enough to wrap around your neck. This exchange of gifts feels sacred, a silent ritual in a world that’s forgotten trust.

Night approaches, and you realize you need one another. Together, you clear a small space in the rubble, piling broken boards to form a makeshift shelter. She finds a half-full jug of rainwater hidden behind charred remains of a cupboard. You manage to pry open the beans with your pocketknife’s dull blade. There’s no fire, but you share the meal raw—better than nothing.

In the darkness, you huddle close for warmth. Outside, feral dogs howl, and the wind moans through empty windows. But inside this fragile space you’ve created, there’s something else: a quiet understanding. You’ve taken a risk to show kindness, and she has answered it. It may not seem like much, but in a world that’s falling apart, a small act of compassion can be the start of something greater.

As sleep drifts closer, you listen to the soft hush of her breathing. The radio is silent tonight, just faint static. But that’s all right. The world is broken, yes. Resources are scarce, dangers lurk in every shadow. Yet here, in this makeshift shelter, you’ve found a reason not just to survive, but to live. The dream settles into your bones, carrying you forward into whatever the next dawn may bring.
