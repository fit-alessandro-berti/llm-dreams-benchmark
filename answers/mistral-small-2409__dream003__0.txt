**Dream Continuation:**

As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and symbols etched into the metal surface. The box seems to hum softly, pulsating with an otherworldly energy. You reach out to touch it, and suddenly, the patterns begin to glow. A soft clicking sound echoes, and you hear a faint voice whisper, "Speak the word."

Confused but intrigued, you ask, "What word?"

The voice responds, "The word that binds."

You rack your brain, trying to remember any words or phrases related to binding. Then, it hits you. A phrase from an old book you once read: "Aetheris mundi venator." You say it aloud, and the box clicks open.

Inside, you find a small, intricately designed hourglass filled with shimmering sand. As you pick it up, the sand begins to flow, and the dream shifts. You are no longer in the familiar surroundings of your room but in a vast, mystical library filled with ancient tomes and scrolls.

A wise, old librarian approaches you, his eyes twinkling with curiosity. "Ah, you've found the Hourglass of Aeons," he says, taking the hourglass from your hands. "It seems you have a quest, traveler. What brings you to the Library of Eternum?"

You hesitate, not sure how to answer. The librarian smiles, "Do not worry, child. In dreams, the truth is often hidden in plain sight. Tell me, what is it that you truly seek?"

As you ponder his question, the dream begins to fade, and you find yourself back in your room, the locked box once again closed and silent on your bedside table.
