...not written in words, but in shifting constellations that rearrange themselves when I blink.

I lean in closer, squinting at the paper. The ink shimmers like oil on water. Question One isn't a question at all; it's a small, folded origami bird glued to the page. It twitches its paper wing. I reach out to touch it, and my finger passes right through, as if the bird is made of smoke.

A voice over the loudspeaker announces, "You have fifty minutes to recall the future."

Panic flares in my chest, the classic exam dread, but it feels distant, muffled by layers of cotton. I look at Question Two. It reads: *Describe the taste of the color blue when you were seven years old.*

I know this answer. I grab my pen, but when I press it to the paper, no ink comes out. Instead, sound pours from the nib—a low hum, then the sound of rain hitting a tin roof. The desk beneath me begins to soften, turning into warm sand. I look up to ask the proctor for a new pen, but the proctor isn't a person anymore. It's a tall mirror standing at the front of the room.

In the reflection, I'm not sitting at a desk. I'm standing in a field of tall grass under a violet sky. The version of me in the mirror smiles and shakes their head, mouthing the words, *You don't need to write it down.*

The sand rises to my waist. The constellations on the exam paper lift off the page, swirling around my head like fireflies. I realize suddenly that I am not being tested on what I know, but on what I can let go of.

I drop the pen. It turns into a white feather before it hits the sand.

"Time's up," the mirror says, but the voice is my own.

The room dissolves into white light, and I am falling upward, waking up, or perhaps finally arriving.
