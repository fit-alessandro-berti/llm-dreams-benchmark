\boxed{You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns etched into its surface. The patterns seem to form some kind of puzzle or code. 

As you trace one part of the pattern, a part of the box lights up. Another part of the pattern makes a faint humming sound. You realize that the box requires a specific sequence of actions based on the patterns. 

After several attempts, you finally find the right sequence: pressing on a part that resembles a sun, followed by a part that looks like a moon, and then a part that seems to represent a star. 

As you complete the sequence, the box makes a soft click sound and slowly opens, revealing a small, glowing object inside. The object seems to radiate a warm, comforting light. 

You reach in and carefully take out the glowing object, which fits perfectly in your hand. As you hold it, a sense of peace and understanding washes over you, as if the object itself is a key to a deeper part of your subconscious. 

You wake up from the dream, still feeling the warmth and glow of the mysterious object in your hand, even though you are now awake and back in your bed.}
