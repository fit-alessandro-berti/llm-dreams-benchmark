take a deep breath and step outside for some air. As you walk into the sunlight, the scenery suddenly shifts and you're standing in a vast, unfamiliar landscape—an endless field of luminous flowers swaying in a breeze you cannot feel. Your friend's voice echoes somewhere behind you, softer now, calling your name.

Driven by a strange pull, you start walking through the sparkling meadow. With every step, the flowers hum gently underfoot, soothing your frustration and hurt. Ahead in the distance, you spot a tall, ancient tree glowing with golden light. Beneath its branches, your friend is waiting, no longer upset but reaching out with an open hand.

Somehow, without words, you both understand one another. The argument dissolves into laughter and warm silence. The world brightens even more, then blurs, as you slowly drift towards waking, carrying with you the sense that everything will be alright.
