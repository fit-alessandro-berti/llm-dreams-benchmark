...feel a warmth spread through your chest, like sunlight breaking through cloud cover after a long grey morning.

There are five of them. Maybe six. They seem to *shimmer* slightly at the edges, the way people do in dreams when you're not supposed to look at them too directly. One of them — a tall woman with braided silver hair and paint-stained fingers — holds out a hand and says something you can't quite hear over the noise of the city, but you *understand* it anyway. That's how it works here.

You take her hand.

And suddenly the city changes.

The crowds part like curtains. The noise — all that crushing, indifferent urban noise — softens into something almost musical. You realize the streets have been trying to tell you something all along, written in the patterns of crosswalk lines and the rhythm of traffic lights.

"Where are you trying to go?" one of the strangers asks. A young boy with serious eyes and a red scarf.

You open your mouth to answer and realize — *genuinely realize, with the full weight of dream-logic truth* — that you don't know. You've never known. And somehow, standing here admitting that, the lostness...

...lifts.

"That's okay," the boy says, nodding like this is the most reasonable thing he's ever heard. "We'll walk with you anyway."

And you do. You walk together through streets that keep *becoming*, and for the first time in the dream — maybe in a long time — the not-knowing feels less like being lost...

...and more like being *free*.
