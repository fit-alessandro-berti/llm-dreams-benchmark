...find a way to survive and understand this world.

The morning sun filters through leaves that seem oddly shaped, and the air carries scents I've never encountered - earthy, wild, untamed. My modern clothes feel foreign against my skin, and I notice people in the distance wearing garments that speak of another time entirely.

As I approach what appears to be a small settlement, I realize I need to:

**Learn their language quickly** - gestures and simple sounds seem to be how they communicate. My attempts at mimicking them draw curious looks but also some patient smiles.

**Understand their customs** - watching carefully as they bow to elders, share food in communal circles, and seem to follow the rhythms of sun and seasons rather than clocks.

**Find shelter and sustenance** - their dwellings are built of wood and stone, and they gather food from gardens I can barely comprehend, where plants grow in harmony with what appears to be deep knowledge passed down through generations.

But most pressingly, I need to **figure out if this is real or just a vivid dream** - because the longer I stay, the more real everything feels, down to the calluses forming on my hands as I attempt to help with their daily tasks.

The question lingers: am I穿越时空, or simply sleeping through an extraordinary adventure my mind has crafted?
