...decide to climb the rusted skeleton of an old radio tower, its metal groaning beneath my feet like whale song. At the top, I discover a garden growing impossibly in the air—tomatoes heavy with fruit that tastes like memories of summer picnics, their vines weaving through the corroded steel beams.

A child appears beside me, though I didn't hear them climb. They hand me a snow globe containing a miniature version of the world before it ended, and when I shake it, instead of snow, tiny seeds fall. "Plant these," they say, but their voice sounds like wind chimes, like my grandmother's laughter, like static between radio stations.

I reach into my pocket and find it full of soil, rich and dark. My hands become roots, spreading down through the tower, through the cracked earth below, touching something warm and alive that's been sleeping all this time. The child smiles and transforms into a flock of origami cranes that spiral upward into clouds that weren't there before.

Below, the wasteland shimmers and shifts like a mirage. I realize I'm not standing anymore—I'm floating, or perhaps the tower is growing, carrying me higher. The stars begin to come out, but they're too close, close enough to pluck like fruit...

And somewhere, distantly, I hear the sound of rain beginning to fall.
