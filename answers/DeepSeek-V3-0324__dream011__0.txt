written in a language you don’t recognize—shimmering symbols that shift and change like liquid silver on the page. The letters twist into shapes resembling ancient runes, yet somehow, you feel a strange familiarity, as if you’ve seen them in another dream.  

A whisper brushes against your ear: *"The answers are already within you."*  

You blink, and suddenly, the words rearrange themselves into your native tongue—but the questions aren’t about math, science, or literature. Instead, they ask:  

1. *What do you truly desire?*  
2. *What fear holds you back?*  
3. *If failure didn’t exist, what would you attempt?*  

The clock on the wall ticks backward. The other students around you fade into mist. The exam is no longer about passing or failing—it’s about *remembering*.  

Do you pick up the pen?  

(How would *you* like the dream to end?)
