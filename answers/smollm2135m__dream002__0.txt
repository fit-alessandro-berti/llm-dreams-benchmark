As I stand frozen on that threshold of calm air to continue my journey through the forest, an unfamiliar gusts assault me with their fury, a tempest that thrumans relentlessly towards our pursuers. The trees seem distorted and twisted, casting macabre silhouettes before me like skeletal fingers reaching for the darkness. Trees themselves swaying precariously in the wind, leaving behind whispers of ancient footsteps that echo through the forest's heart by now silent. I feel as though my footsteps have been taken blindfolded and plummet to the earth below, yet a thrill runs down my spine every time they strike a tree or brush against it with reckless abandon - I trust this might be true.
