You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to wander the neon-lit streets, skyscrapers twisting like impossible spires into a bruised purple sky. Crowds of shadowy figures brush past you—some with faces made of flickering holograms, others whispering in languages that twist your thoughts into knots.

Panic bubbles up as your phone buzzes uselessly in your pocket, its screen cracked and displaying only a looping map of fractal patterns. You hail a cab, but the driver is a grinning fox in a pinstripe suit who laughs and drives you in circles through alleyways where buildings fold in on themselves like origami. "The meeting's wherever you fear it most," he cackles, before dissolving into smoke.

Desperate, you duck into a towering atrium lined with escalators that spiral upward into infinity. At the top—or what feels like the top—you step into a glass elevator plummeting sideways through the city's underbelly, past rivers of liquid starlight and markets selling bottled memories. The doors open to a rooftop penthouse where suited executives with clockwork eyes await, their briefcases stuffed with wriggling eels.

"You're late," they chorus, but as you stammer an apology, the floor dissolves. You fall upward into a storm of paper cranes, each one unfolding into a new city, a new meeting, an endless loop. And just as you spot the address tattooed on your own wrist—"Here"—you jolt awake, heart pounding, the alarm blaring for a meeting that's very, very real.
