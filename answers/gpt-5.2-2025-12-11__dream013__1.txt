…begin to notice that the puzzles aren’t just obstacles—they’re questions the maze is asking *about you*.

The first chamber is tiled in black and white, like a chessboard that extends up the walls and across the ceiling. In the center sits a pedestal holding a glass cube. Inside the cube, a small storm spins in silence. The rules are carved into the floor in a language you somehow understand without reading:

**Choose a path. Lose a possibility.**

You touch the cube. The storm pauses, waiting. Around you, doors appear—dozens of them—each labeled with something ordinary: **“Call back.” “Apologize.” “Quit.” “Stay.” “Begin.”** You try to reason your way through, mapping outcomes, weighing probabilities, building a perfect plan. The maze stays perfectly still, patient and unworried, as if it has all night.

Finally you choose one door, and the cube clicks like a lock.

The moment it does, all the other doors erase themselves—labels fading first, then handles, then the outlines—until the wall is smooth stone again, as if those options were never real.

You step through.

The corridors tighten. The air smells faintly of paper and rain. Every few steps, a new puzzle blooms out of the floor: interlocking rings that must be turned in precise sequences; mirrors that show you walking in a direction your body isn’t; riddles that change when you speak them aloud. You solve them the way you always do—by holding too many threads in your mind at once, by refusing to guess, by insisting there must be a clean solution if you think hard enough.

And you keep going.

Deeper in, you begin to hear a sound underneath everything: the soft scratch of pencil on parchment, like someone taking notes. You round a corner and find a long gallery lined with portraits—hundreds—each one a different version of you. Some are unmistakable: you laughing, you exhausted, you furious, you proud. Others are subtle differences that make your stomach tighten: you in a life where you never met certain people, you with a scar you don’t recognize, you in a city you’ve never seen.

Beneath each portrait is a plaque with a single word:

**“IF.”**

At the end of the gallery is a door with no handle. In its place is a circular indentation the size of your palm. Above it, another inscription:

**Prove you are the one who arrived.**

You press your hand to the indentation.

The door warms, and a pulse runs up your arm. For a moment, you feel your own heartbeat not as a rhythm, but as an answer being checked. Then the stone door swings inward with the sound of a page turning.

Inside is the heart of the maze: a wide room with a ceiling so high it disappears into darkness. The floor is a mosaic of symbols—logic gates, constellations, old alphabets, the same chessboard pattern from before—arranged in a way that makes your eyes want to blur. In the center stands a table set for one, and on it, a puzzle box made of wood and brass. It looks ancient and new at the same time.

Beside it sits a card:

**ONE LAST PUZZLE.**

You lift the box. It’s heavier than it should be. You run your fingers over its seams, searching for the trick. There are no obvious latches, no hidden buttons. Just carved designs that loop back on themselves like thoughts you can’t stop replaying.

You do what you always do: you analyze. You test. You try combinations. You search for patterns. Minutes stretch into something thicker. The scratch of pencil grows louder.

Then you notice the chair across from you.

There wasn’t a second chair before.

Someone is sitting there—someone blurred at the edges, as if your mind refuses to render them fully. They have a notebook open, and the pencil in their hand is the sound you’ve been hearing.

They don’t speak. They just watch you fail, patiently, like the maze itself.

Heat rises in your throat. Not anger exactly—something closer to dread.

“Tell me what you want,” you say, and the words echo upward into the dark.

The figure finally lifts their head. Their face is yours, but slightly wrong—like a mirror that has learned to lie.

“I want you to stop treating this like a problem you can outthink,” they say. Their voice is quiet, familiar, exhausted. “It’s not locked with cleverness.”

They tap the puzzle box once. You feel it in your bones, like a metronome.

“It opens with a truth.”

You swallow. “Which truth?”

They turn the notebook toward you. The pages are filled with your handwriting—lists, diagrams, contingencies, rules. In the margins are tiny, repeated sentences you don’t remember writing:

**If you solve it perfectly, you don’t have to feel it.**  
**If you solve it perfectly, you can’t be hurt.**  
**If you solve it perfectly, you can’t be wrong.**

The maze seems to lean in.

You look back at the box. Your hands are trembling now, not from fear of the mechanism, but from the weight of admitting what you’ve been doing. You realize every puzzle so far has been a variation of the same demand: *choose, risk, lose, continue.*

You close your eyes.

And you say the first truth that arrives—not rehearsed, not optimized:

“I’m tired.”

The room goes still. The figure across from you stops writing.

A soft click.

You open your eyes. The seam of the box has shifted. It isn’t dramatic; it’s almost polite, like a door opening for someone who finally knocked.

You lift the lid.

Inside is not a treasure or a weapon or a key, but a small, ordinary object: a compass. Its glass is scratched. The needle wobbles, then steadies—not pointing north, but pointing *somewhere specific*, with stubborn certainty.

Under the compass is another card:

**THE MAZE DOESN’T END. IT CHANGES.**

The blurred-you across the table nods once, as if this was the only answer they were waiting for.

“What does the compass point to?” you ask.

“To the next honest step,” they say. “Not the safest. Not the cleanest. The real one.”

The room begins to shift—the mosaics sliding like pieces on a board, the symbols rearranging into a path. Walls fold back. Corridors unfurl. Somewhere far away, you hear water running, and it feels like relief.

You stand, compass in hand.

And for the first time since entering the maze, you don’t try to map the whole thing.

You follow the needle.

The air grows cooler. The stone beneath your feet changes texture, from polished to rough to something like packed earth. The light ahead isn’t torchlight or moonlight; it’s the pale, pre-dawn light that exists before you decide whether to wake.

You turn one final corner and find a doorway made of nothing at all—just an outline of brightness in the shape of an exit.

On the threshold, you hesitate, expecting a final riddle.

Instead, you hear the pencil scratch one last time, and the other-you speaks softly behind you:

“You can come back whenever you forget.”

You step through.

The brightness fills your vision, and the maze dissolves like chalk in rain.

When you open your eyes—whether in the dream or in your bed, you can’t tell at first—you’re still holding something in your palm.

Not the compass.

Just the warmth of it.

And the feeling of a direction.
