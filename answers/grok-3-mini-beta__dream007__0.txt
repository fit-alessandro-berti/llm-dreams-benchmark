You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to storm out of the room, your heart pounding like a drum in your chest. The air feels thick and electric, like the atmosphere before a thunderstorm, and as you slam the door behind you, the world around you starts to warp in that disorienting way dreams do.

Suddenly, you're not in your living room anymore. The familiar walls melt into a vast, misty forest, where the trees whisper secrets you can't quite hear. Your friend is still there, chasing after you, their face a mix of anger and concern, but now they're floating a few inches off the ground, as if gravity has decided to take a break. "Wait!" they shout, their voice echoing unnaturally, like it's coming from everywhere at once. The thing you're arguing about—maybe it's a shared dream, a forgotten promise, or a betrayal that feels world-ending—grows larger in your mind, manifesting as shadowy figures lurking between the trees.

You decide to keep running, your feet barely touching the soft, glowing moss beneath you. The forest twists and turns, and soon you're not sure if you're fleeing from your friend or from the argument itself. Emotions swirl like storm clouds: regret, frustration, love. Then, in a surreal twist, you spot a glowing bridge ahead, arching over a chasm of swirling colors. You pause, realizing this might be a way out—or deeper in.

Your friend catches up, and instead of yelling, they extend a hand. "Let's not do this," they say, their voice softening. In that moment, you decide to take their hand, and as you do, the bridge lights up, pulling you both into a whirlwind of light. The argument dissolves like mist in the sun, replaced by a profound understanding. You feel a weight lift, but just as peace settles, the dream fades.

You wake up in your bed, heart still racing, the echo of the argument lingering. Was it real? Or just your subconscious working through unresolved feelings? You glance at your phone—maybe it's time to call your friend and talk it out for real. Dreams have a way of showing us what matters.
