intricate patterns etched into its surface—swirling vines that twist like living serpents, ancient runes that pulse with a faint, ethereal glow, and geometric shapes that seem to shift when you blink. As you trace your fingers over them, a strange warmth spreads through your hand, pulling you deeper into the dream's haze.

Suddenly, the patterns begin to move on their own, as if the box is breathing. The vines uncoil and wrap around your wrist, not tightly, but gently, like an invitation. You feel a whisper in your mind, not words exactly, but emotions—curiosity, longing, secrets long buried. The box starts to hum, vibrating softly, and without a key, it unlocks itself with a soft click that echoes in the void around you.

Inside, instead of treasure or trinkets, you find a mirror. But this isn't an ordinary mirror; it reflects not your face, but fragments of forgotten memories—childhood laughter in a sunlit field, a shadowy figure from a past argument, and glimpses of futures that never were. As you reach in, the dream warps: the room around you dissolves into a vast, starry expanse, and the box floats away, becoming a distant star.

You try to call out, but your voice turns into music, harmonizing with the cosmos. Just as the patterns from the box reappear in the stars, forming a constellation that spells your name, you feel a jolt—like waking from a deep sleep. The dream fades, leaving you with a lingering question: was the box a key to your own mind, or just another mystery in the night? You stir, heart racing, wondering if you'll dream of it again.
