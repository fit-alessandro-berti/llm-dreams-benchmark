…you encounter various groups of people and each cluster seems to be holding its own private weather.

Near the entrance, a circle of strangers laughs too loudly, their voices rising like helium. They’re dressed for different decades—one person in a powdered wig, another in a hoodie with tomorrow’s date printed across the chest. When you ask if they’ve seen the one person you know, they all point in different directions without breaking eye contact, as if direction is a trick question. One of them presses a paper wristband into your palm. It’s warm, like it’s been worn by someone else recently, and it reads: **GUEST / MAYBE**.

You move deeper into the room.

A group by the windows stands perfectly still, watching something outside. You follow their gaze, expecting a garden or a street, but the glass shows an ocean at night, waves turning over in slow, quiet muscle. Every now and then a flash of light blooms beneath the surface, like distant fireworks or deep-sea creatures. Someone hands you a cup of something clear and says, “If you want to find someone, you have to look at them the way they look at themselves.” You drink, and the liquid tastes like the moment right before you remember a name.

The crowd shifts and opens like a mouth making space for a word.

There’s a table laden with food, but the dishes are labeled with emotions instead of ingredients: *Relief*, *Embarrassment*, *Unsent Message*, *First Day*. People scoop them onto plates and chew thoughtfully. A woman in a silver dress offers you a slice of *Nostalgia* that smells exactly like your childhood hallway. You almost take it, but you see your reflection in the serving spoon and don’t recognize your face. You set your hands in your pockets to feel for your phone, but your phone isn’t there—only a small key that looks older than you are.

A burst of music comes from another room, and you follow it, certain it’s the kind your friend would like. The doorway is a curtain made of long ribbons. As you part them, you feel each ribbon pull lightly at your sleeves as though trying to keep you from going through.

Inside, people are dancing, but not to the music. They’re dancing to their own thoughts: little, precise movements, each person slightly out of sync, like a room full of clocks. In the center is a man conducting them with an empty baton. When you ask about your friend, he raises his hand and the dancers all freeze mid-motion. The silence that follows is so complete you can hear the soft buzz of the lights.

“You only know one person?” he says, as if tasting the sentence. “Then you’re going to notice them everywhere.”

He gestures toward a mirror at the far end of the room.

You cross to it. The mirror is tall and rippling, like water held upright. In it, you see the party from above: the knots of people, the buffet of emotions, the ocean window. And moving through all of it is someone who looks like your friend and yet doesn’t—same posture, same way of tilting their head when listening, but their face keeps changing, as though it can’t settle on a final version. Every time you focus, they turn a corner, step behind someone taller, disappear into a pocket of shadow.

You press your palm to the mirror, and it’s warm. The key in your pocket grows heavy, insistently present.

You leave the dance room and wander into a hallway that wasn’t there before. The noise of the gathering dims behind you, replaced by a hush like carpet absorbing footsteps. Doors line the corridor, each with a small nameplate that changes as you read it: **THE PERSON YOU WERE TRYING TO IMPRESS**, **THE PERSON YOU DIDN’T CALL BACK**, **THE PERSON WHO WAITED**, **THE PERSON YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN**.

At the end of the hallway is a single door with no name at all, only a keyhole that matches the key in your pocket.

You hesitate, feeling the absurdity of needing permission in your own dream, but your hand moves anyway. The key slides in smoothly, as if the lock has been waiting specifically for this.

The door opens onto a small room lit by a low lamp. It’s quiet, gently so. There’s a couch, an old record player, and a coat draped over a chair like someone stepped out for a moment. On the wall is a corkboard crowded with photos and sticky notes—some in your handwriting, some not. You recognize the one person you know in several pictures: laughing at a café table, standing beside you in a street, blurred at the edge of a group shot as if they were always half in motion.

On the couch sits your friend.

Only they look…simpler. Not in a diminished way—more like an unfiltered version. Their face holds still. Their eyes find yours without searching.

“You’ve been looking,” they say.

“I couldn’t find you,” you answer, and it comes out more like an apology than a statement.

They pat the cushion beside them. When you sit, the couch sighs with the relief of an object finally being used for what it was made for.

“I was here,” they say, nodding toward the party sounds seeping faintly through the walls. “But you kept checking everyone else’s idea of where I should be.”

You want to tell them about the ocean window and the table of emotions and the dancers moving to their thoughts, but the words arrive clumsy and fall apart before they reach your mouth. Instead you say, “Why is it so hard?”

Your friend considers you with the calm of someone who has already lived this moment once. “Because you only know one person,” they say, “and you’re afraid it’s not enough. So you keep trying to meet more people all at once.”

The lamp flickers, and for an instant the room looks like a memory you can’t place: a late-night conversation, a quiet car ride, a kitchen lit by the open fridge. You feel the shape of all the times you were close to reaching out and didn’t.

From outside the room, the party swells—laughter, music, the bright clatter of glasses—like it’s trying to pull you back into it.

“What happens if I stay here?” you ask.

Your friend smiles, small and certain. “Then the party becomes background noise.”

You lean back into the couch. The key in your pocket cools, becoming ordinary metal again. Your breathing slows to match the steady click of the record player’s needle finding its groove, though you can’t remember putting a record on.

The door behind you drifts closed on its own, not with a slam but with a soft finality. The sounds of the gathering fade until they’re no more than the imagined hum of a distant crowd.

In the quiet, your friend begins to tell you something important—something you’ve been trying to remember for days, maybe years—but as they speak, their voice merges with the sound of your own thoughts, and the words become too familiar to hold onto. You feel them settle inside you anyway, like a note slipped into a pocket.

The lamp dims.

The ocean window, the ribbons, the laughter—everything blurs gently at the edges.

And just before you wake, you realize you aren’t searching anymore.
