...frantically searching for clues. The streets are a labyrinth of towering skyscrapers and neon signs in a language you don’t understand. People hurry past, their faces blurred, as if they’re not quite real. You pull out your phone, but the screen flickers and the map app refuses to load. Time feels like it’s speeding up.

Spotting a small coffee shop tucked between two buildings, you dash inside, hoping to ask for directions. The air is thick with the scent of espresso and cinnamon. Behind the counter stands an elderly woman with kind eyes and a knowing smile. She doesn’t speak, but she slides a small, intricately folded paper crane across the counter to you. As you unfold it, you find a map scribbled inside, with a path leading to a building shaped like a spiral.

Thanking her, you rush outside and follow the map. The streets shift and twist as you walk, but the spiral building always seems to be just ahead. Finally, you arrive at the base of the structure. The entrance is a giant, swirling vortex of light. You hesitate for a moment, but knowing the meeting is crucial, you step through.

Inside, you find yourself in a vast, open room filled with people from all walks of life—some familiar, some strangers. They’re all chatting animatedly, but no one seems to notice you. At the center of the room is a large, glowing hourglass. The sand is nearly out. You realize this isn’t just a meeting—it’s a moment of decision, a turning point. But before you can act, the sand runs out, and you wake up.
