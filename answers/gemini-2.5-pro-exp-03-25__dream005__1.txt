Okay, sinking deeper into the dream...

The air hums with a low, resonant thrum, like a giant unseen machine is breathing somewhere nearby. It's not unpleasant, just... *present*. The light is strange, too – shifting between a warm, syrupy gold and a cool, almost underwater blue, making people's faces hard to focus on. The chatter isn't distinct words, just a wall of overlapping murmurs, punctuated by sudden, sharp bursts of laughter that seem too loud, too brittle.

I need to find Maya. She's the only familiar anchor in this shifting sea of faces. I remember she said she'd be wearing green. My eyes scan the room, a vast space that seems to keep stretching the more I look at it. Pillars like ancient trees rise to a ceiling lost in shadow.

**...encounter various groups of people and...**

**1. The Group of Identical Smiles:** I approach a cluster near a bubbling fountain that seems to be dispensing shimmering liquid, not water. Five people stand in a tight circle, all looking inwards. As I get closer, they turn simultaneously, their heads moving with an unnerving synchronicity. They all have the *exact* same smile – wide, white, and utterly vacant. It doesn't reach their eyes, which remain fixed on something just over my shoulder. One of them raises a glass of the shimmering liquid towards me, the smile unwavering. I feel a prickle of unease and quickly detour around them, the smiles tracking my movement until I'm past.

**2. The Weavers of Conversation:** Further on, I see a group sitting on low, velvet cushions. They aren't talking *to* each other in the normal sense. Instead, shimmering threads of light, like spun moonlight, arc between them. One person will gesture, and a thread of sapphire light drifts from their hand to another person, who seems to 'catch' it, nod, and then send a thread of emerald light back. They are literally weaving their conversation. It's beautiful but utterly alien. I try to catch someone's eye, to ask about Maya, but they are completely absorbed in their luminous tapestry. Trying to interrupt feels like trying to snatch smoke.

**3. The Floating Listeners:** Near a wall that seems to be made of gently rippling water, several individuals hover about six inches off the ground. They aren't talking or interacting, just slowly rotating, their eyes closed, faint music seeming to emanate *from* them – discordant, melancholic chimes. As I walk past, the air around them feels strangely cold and still. One of them drifts directly into my path. I stop, unsure whether to push past or wait. Their eyes snap open – pure white, no iris or pupil – stare directly into mine for a second that feels like an eternity, then snap shut again as they continue their slow rotation. I sidestep quickly, the cold spot lingering on my skin.

**4. The Collectors of Lost Things:** I stumble into a quieter alcove. Here, people move slowly, purposefully, examining the floor. They occasionally stoop to pick something up, inspect it with intense concentration, and then place it carefully into ornate, mismatched boxes they carry. I glance down. The floor is littered with... buttons of every shape and size, single shoes, keys for unknown locks, fragments of photographs showing unfamiliar faces. One person holds up a brightly coloured marble, turning it over and over, a look of profound sadness on their face. "Have you seen a green scarf?" I ask tentatively. They look up, startled, clutching the marble protectively. "Only lost things here," they whisper, their voice like rustling leaves, before turning back to their search.

Panic begins to set in. The room feels larger now, the ceiling higher, the thrumming louder. Where *is* Maya? I spin around, scanning desperately. The groups seem to be subtly shifting, blurring at the edges. The identical smiles seem wider, sharper. The woven conversation threads are tangling. The floating listeners are drifting higher.

Then, across the vast expanse, near a doorway that pulses faintly, I see a flash of emerald green. Relief floods me. It *must* be her. I start pushing through the crowd, which now feels thicker, more resistant, like wading through lukewarm honey. "Maya!" I try to call out, but my voice comes out as a weak croak, instantly swallowed by the humming din.

As I get closer, the figure in green turns. It *is* Maya's dress, her distinctive emerald scarf... but the face isn't hers. It's shifting, flickering like a badly tuned television – one moment an old man's face, then a child's, then something not quite human with too many eyes. It raises a hand, beckoning me forward, and the floor beneath my feet suddenly feels like it's tilting, threatening to slide me right towards that impossible doorway... and I feel myself starting to fall, not down, but *sideways*... the humming rising to a roar... fading... fading...
