and you decide to stop shouting. Instead you reach into your pocket and pull out a tiny, brass door the size of a matchbox. You set it down between you and, without asking, both crouch to open it. A corridor pours out—softly lit, impossibly long—lined with fragments of your shared past: a chipped coffee mug, a scribbled note, the echo of laughter from a late-night conversation. Each step you take unwraps a memory and you find you are no longer arguing about the surface thing but moving through the reasons it matters.

Your friend picks up a lantern that wasn't there a moment before and the flame smells like rain. When the lantern light falls on a particular memory—the first time you each said something that stuck—it swells and becomes a small, honest sentence that floats up like a paper boat. You take it, read it aloud, and the words sound like someone else's at first, then like both of you. The corridor collapses into a pond. You both kneel, touch the water, and the ripples rearrange into a single clear image: not a solution but a pathway back to each other.

You don't finish the argument. You trade it for the act of listening. In the dream the listening is visible—threads of color running from your throats into the pond—so that when you wake you remember not everything needs to be won, some things need to be walked through together.
