feel a wave of panic rising in your chest. The room seems to tilt slightly, the fluorescent lights flickering as if struggling to stay on. Your boss’s face blurs into a featureless mask, their voice echoing unnaturally loud, repeating, *"The deadline is tomorrow. No excuses."*

You glance at your desk—papers scatter like leaves in a storm, files open to blank pages, and your computer screen displays a cryptic error message: **"SYSTEM OVERLOAD. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK."** The clock on the wall ticks backward, its hands spinning faster and faster.

Your hands hover over the keyboard, but the keys are now made of rubber, stretching and warping under your touch. The project requirements shift before your eyes—first, it’s a 50-page report, then a 3D model, then a live presentation to an audience of shadowy figures with glowing red eyes.

A coworker leans over your shoulder, whispering, *"You’re not supposed to be here."* Their breath smells like burnt paper. The walls begin to bleed ink, pooling at your feet. The ceiling cracks open, revealing a swirling void where the sky should be.

Your boss’s voice distorts into a chorus of whispers: *"You can’t finish this. You never could."*

Suddenly, the alarm on your nightstand blares, jolting you awake. You’re drenched in sweat, your heart pounding. The dream lingers—was it a warning? A premonition? Or just your subconscious screaming for a vacation?

(Or… do you want to keep dreaming? The nightmare isn’t over yet.)
