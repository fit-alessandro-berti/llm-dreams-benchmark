written in a language you don’t recognize—strange symbols swirl across the page, shifting and rearranging themselves as you try to focus. The clock on the wall ticks backward, and the other students around you seem frozen in time, their pencils hovering mid-air.  

A whisper echoes in your mind: *"This isn’t just a test—it’s a choice."*  

Suddenly, the paper in front of you transforms into a mirror, reflecting not your face, but a branching path of possible futures. Each question is now a doorway—some glowing with warmth, others pulsing with eerie light.

3. **Turn to the frozen student beside you**, hoping to find a clue in their stillness?  
4. **Stand up and walk away**, realizing this exam is something far beyond what you expected?  

The dream lingers, waiting for your next move...
