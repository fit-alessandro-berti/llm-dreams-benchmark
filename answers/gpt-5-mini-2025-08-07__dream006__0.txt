...speak, and nothing comes out the way you expect.

At first there’s just the tick of the microphone, a small, solitary sound like a metronome inside a seashell. Then a word forms in your mouth and instead of air it becomes light — a thin filament of silver that slips out and drifts over the first row. It lands on a man’s hand and blooms into a paper bird. He smiles without surprise and tucks it into his shirt pocket like a secret. You try another sentence; it unravels into a smell — fresh-cut grass, rain on hot pavement — and rolls across the aisle, and people close their eyes as if remembering a street from childhood.

You keep talking. Each phrase takes its own shape: a paragraph that flutters away as loose-leaf pages, a joke that jumps up and begins to juggle itself between audience members, an apology that folds into a hat and sits politely on the head of the woman two rows back. The spotlight tastes like copper and honey. Your throat is not afraid anymore; the fear peels off in thin, translucent sheets and floats upward to the rafters where they form a constellation of paper suns.

Something else shifts — the crowd is not a crowd but a garden. Faces bloom into flowers, nodding petals in cadence. Some people become clocks with hands that rewind when you speak of second chances. A child at the center sprouts a kite from her palm, colors spilling like sentences across the ceiling. When you reach the sentence you meant to say when you first stepped on stage — the one that had felt too heavy to utter — it comes out as a song so small it can be cupped in both hands. The song enlarges as it is heard, and with each listener it gathers a new harmony: a cough becomes a drumbeat, a laugh a piccolo, a tear a bell.

You realize the speech is not something you deliver to them; it is something you weave with them. The audience is listening by weaving their own answers into the air, and each answer changes the meaning of what you thought you were saying. You feel a tide of recognition — someone in the third row is your grandfather, someone toward the back is a version of you who never left the town where you grew up, and in the front, nearest the stage, is a blank chair that begins to fill as you speak with the idea of the person you are becoming.

When the last line leaves you it lingers in the room like incense. The applause is a slow rain of folded paper — some are letters, some are tiny boats — and they all come to rest on the stage like fossils. You step down, not out of fear but because the edge of the stage dissolves into a shoreline. The audience rises as if taking a bow and walks away along the water to places you cannot name. You follow a single paper boat into the dark between waves, and wake up with the taste of honey on your tongue and the feeling that you have said something important that no one will ever be able to repeat exactly the same way.
