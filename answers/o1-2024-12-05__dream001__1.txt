…wander through the winding streets, feeling the cobblestones press into the soles of your shoes with each uncertain step. The city feels both strangely modern and deeply archaic: sleek, mirrored skyscrapers rise next to ancient stone towers draped in thick green vines. It’s as if centuries of architectural styles have converged here, compressing time into a single space.

You glance at your watch—it reads an unfamiliar time, as if hours have melted and re-formed into strange new segments. It’s ticking, but not in seconds—more like heartbeats. You know you must hurry, but no matter which corner you turn, you never recognize anything. The crowd around you moves briskly, their faces blurred and indistinct, as if they exist only at the edges of your vision. When you try to stop someone to ask directions, they seem to vanish, dissolving into the city’s background before you can speak.

Overhead, an odd sky stretches out. It’s late morning, perhaps, but the sun is shaped like a crescent, and its light falls in watery patterns that remind you of sunlight beneath a lake’s surface. A sudden thought occurs to you: maybe the meeting spot is somewhere high up. You notice a grand old library in the distance—its façade carved with symbols you half recognize. Maybe there’s a map inside. You press on, weaving through the throng of silent passersby, determined to find some clue.

Approaching the library’s immense wooden doors, you feel a heaviness. Pushing them open, you enter a corridor lined with shelves of books that have no titles on their spines. The air is thick with the scent of old paper, and your footsteps echo. At the far end, behind a massive oak desk, sits a librarian wearing a veil of midnight-blue silk. She turns to look at you, though you cannot see her eyes, and extends a hand towards the ceiling. Without a word, you follow her gesture, and realize a spiral staircase leads upward, hidden in the shadows.

The staircase ascends into a tower filled with overlapping whispers. Each step you take merges into a soft hum of voices, as though the city itself is speaking quietly to you. At the top, there’s a single window looking out over a plaza. You see a statue there—a large bronze figure pointing east, toward a broad avenue lined with shimmering streetlamps. The avenue could lead to where you need to go. Time is slipping away, so you hurry down the tower, back through the library, and out into the street.

Now you know you must head toward that statue. When you reach the plaza, the bronze figure’s gaze directs you along a corridor of trees whose trunks are twisted into words you cannot read. The path soon ends at a small café. Inside, a waiter glides over to you, and in a voice that sounds like distant wind chimes, says, “Your appointment is just through the back door.”

Confused but relieved, you pass through the café’s back door and step into a room that is both familiar and foreign. It resembles a boardroom, but the table is made of polished amber and the chairs are carved from something like bone. Seated around the table are people you think you might know: old friends, past mentors, and faces that once appeared in your life for a moment but left no name behind. They smile at you expectantly.

As you take your seat, the clock on the wall stops ticking. The tension eases, as if just by arriving you’ve fulfilled the strange requirement of this meeting. Perhaps its true purpose was simply to guide you through the city and all its impossible clues. The crescent sun shifts outside the window, and you open your mouth to speak, though no words come. Instead, the voices you heard on the staircase fill the silence, and you realize that in this city—this dream—finding your way was the meeting all along.
