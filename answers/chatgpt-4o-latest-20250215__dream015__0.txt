push forward, determined to carve out a life in the ruins of what once was. The air is thick with the scent of smoke and rust, remnants of a world that burned away. Crumbling skyscrapers stand like skeletal remains, their shattered windows reflecting the dying embers of the sun. 

You tighten the straps on your makeshift backpack, scavenged from an abandoned military outpost, and check your supplies—half a can of beans, a bottle of murky water, and a rusted knife. Not much, but enough to survive another day. 

A distant howl echoes through the ruins, sending a chill down your spine. The creatures—twisted by whatever catastrophe befell the world—hunt in the dark. You need shelter before nightfall.

As you move through the crumbling streets, your eyes catch movement—a flicker of shadow behind a rusted car. You freeze, hand tightening around your knife. Friend or foe? The choice is yours: call out and risk betrayal, or slip away into the ruins and survive alone. 

What do you do?
