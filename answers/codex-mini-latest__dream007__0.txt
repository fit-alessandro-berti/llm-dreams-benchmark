You close your eyes against the sting of betrayal, take a slow, measured breath—and in that instant the room tilts. Your friend’s voice echoes around you, distorted, each word twisting into something new and strange. You realize you’re no longer standing in the cramped living room where the argument began, but on the crest of an impossibly steep hill under a sky the color of old bruises.

You plant your feet and let the argument slip from your mind. Rather than shouting back, you turn your palms skyward, feeling the heavy air settle in your lungs. Your friend—still only a few feet away—hesitates, caught between anger and confusion. Above you, the clouds part just enough to let a single beam of golden light touch the crest of the hill.

Without a word, you begin to climb. The slope is treacherous: each step feels like wading through half-submerged roots, like your doubts and regrets reaching up to trip you. Behind you, your friend follows, quieter now, their silhouette wavering like a reflection in rippling water.

At the summit, you find a massive, twisted oak tree whose roots coil and knot above the ground like sleeping serpents. In the hollow of its trunk glows a soft, pulsing light—warm and insistent, as though it knows your names. You both approach the tree in silence, the seriousness of your quarrel receding, replaced by something more tender: a shared wonder at the world’s capacity to surprise you.

You raise your hand and touch the tree’s bark. It’s alive with vibrations, each pulse resonating with the unspoken words you and your friend have hoarded beneath the fight: fear of losing one another, pride too stubborn to admit vulnerability, love tangled up in wounded impatience. As the bark pulses, you feel it urging you to speak—really speak—beyond the blame and the outrage.

You turn and meet your friend’s gaze. Their eyes are moist, luminous. You realize that the argument—painful as it was—was born of something you both cherish deeply. You take a breath and say:

“I’m scared. I never meant to hurt you.”

They nod, and their own defenses crumble. “I know,” they whisper. “I’m sorry too. I just didn’t know how else to say it.”

A warm wind stirs the oak’s leaves, like the world itself exhaling relief. The pulsing light softens into a steady glow. Together, you press your foreheads together and laugh—an awkward, trembling sound at first, but one that grows until it rings clear through the dream‑sky.

Then the hill begins to dissolve beneath your feet. The oak tree’s branches unravel into threads of golden light, weaving around you and your friend until you’re both cocooned in warmth. Even as the ground slips away, you feel grounded—rooted not in soil, but in the renewed bond between you.

When you finally open your eyes, you are back in the living room. The argument has faded to memory, but in its place burns a bright, fragile truce. You reach out and take your friend’s hand, and they squeeze back—no words needed now. In the lingering hush, you realize that sometimes it takes losing your footing to learn how to stand together.
