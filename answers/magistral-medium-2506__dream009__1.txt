**Dream Completion:**

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find shelter before nightfall**.

The air smells of woodsmoke and earth, and the distant sound of a river guides you forward. The people you encounter wear rough-spun clothes and eye you with curiosity—for some reason, they don’t seem entirely surprised by your presence. A kind-faced elder approaches and says, *"The stars have brought you here for a reason. But the night is dangerous; creatures of shadow roam after dark. Come."*

As you follow, you notice strange symbols carved into the trees—warnings, or perhaps a map. The elder hands you a small, worn stone with an unfamiliar rune etched into it. *"This will help you remember,"* they murmur before vanishing into the mist.

Suddenly, you realize the stone is warm in your palm—not just an artifact, but a key. But to what? And why does the landscape seem to shift slightly when you hold it up to the fading light?

Before you can ask, the villagers gather around a fire, whispering. One points to the horizon, where a jagged mountain looms, its peak glowing faintly. *"The Gate,"* someone says. *"That’s where you must go."*

You grip the stone tighter, knowing your journey is only beginning. But first, you must survive the night.
