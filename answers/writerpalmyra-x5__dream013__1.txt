...feel the air grow cooler, the stone walls shifting from dull gray to a deep, iridescent blue that pulses faintly, like a slow heartbeat. The puzzles evolve—no longer just locks, riddles, or sliding tiles, but shifting equations etched in light, constellations that rearrange themselves when you blink, and mirrors that reflect not your face, but fragments of memories you don’t recognize.

One puzzle hums a melody that sounds like your mother’s voice, singing a lullaby from a childhood you barely remember. Solving it doesn’t unlock a path—it unlocks a feeling: warmth, safety, followed by a sudden pang of loss. You hesitate. The maze isn’t just testing logic anymore. It’s pulling something from you.

As you step forward, the corridor branches—each path now glowing with a different color, each tied to a distinct emotion: gold for courage, violet for regret, silver for hope.

Which path do you take? And why does part of you feel like you’ve done this before?
