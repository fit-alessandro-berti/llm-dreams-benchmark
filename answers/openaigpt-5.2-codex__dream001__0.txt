…panic a little, then notice the streets are shifting like a maze, buildings sliding into new places as if the city itself is alive. You pull out your phone, but the screen shows a map made of clouds, the meeting location drifting like a balloon.

A stranger in a coat of mirrored glass walks past and points without looking. “Follow the river,” they say, though there is no river in sight. When you turn the corner, there is one—running not with water but with luminous ink, reflecting a sky that doesn’t match the one above. You step along its bank, and each step makes the air hum softly, like a distant song.

You pass doors that open onto forests, staircases that spiral into the clouds, and a subway entrance that leads to a golden field. Time feels stretchy; the hour on your watch melts and reforms. Eventually, you reach a building that wasn’t there a moment ago. It’s your childhood home, standing inexplicably in the heart of the city.

You go inside, and the meeting is already in progress—everyone is seated at a long table, waiting. They look up, smiling as if they’ve been expecting you. You sit down, and as you do, you realize the meeting isn’t about business at all. It’s about you remembering something you forgot long ago. The moment you understand, the room fills with light and the city outside begins to dissolve into morning mist.
