…and you feel a warmth spread through you as they gather around, their faces lit with an unspoken gentleness. One of them takes out a small, hand-drawn map, the edges worn from many uses, as though it has been guiding lost souls for years. Another hands you a cup of tea, impossibly hot and fragrant despite appearing from nowhere, the steam curling into shapes that almost look like words.  

As you begin walking with them, the city feels less like a maze and more like a vast, intricate tapestry—streets bending and unfurling into hidden gardens, lanterns glowing like stars at street corners. The crowd’s noise softens, tuning itself to the rhythm of your own breath, until you realize the strangers are not really leading you *to* a place, but walking beside you *through* something.  

When you glance back, the path you’ve come down is no longer filled with concrete and glass. Instead, it shimmers like a river of light, each step you’ve taken glowing faintly behind you, as if to say: you were never as lost as you feared.  

And then one of the strangers smiles knowingly and asks: *"Are you ready to see where you truly wanted to go all along?"*  

Would you like me to continue and reveal what that destination is—or leave the dream open, like a doorway?
