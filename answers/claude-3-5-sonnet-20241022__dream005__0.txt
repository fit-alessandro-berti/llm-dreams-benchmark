Let me continue this dream scenario:

I encounter various groups of people and notice something peculiar - they're all wearing masks that seem to shift and change when I'm not looking directly at them. One group is huddled around a fountain that appears to be flowing upward instead of down. As I move through the crowd, I hear fragments of conversations in languages I've never heard before, yet somehow understand.

My feet feel increasingly heavy, as if walking through invisible honey. The person I'm looking for seems to appear briefly in my peripheral vision, but when I turn to look, they're always just disappearing around another corner. The wallpaper in the venue begins to ripple like waves, and the ceiling keeps changing height - sometimes impossibly high, sometimes uncomfortably low.

A woman in a silver dress approaches me and hands me a key made of blue glass, whispering \ the music starts.\ means, she dissolves into a cloud of butterflies. The air fills with a distant melody that seems to be coming from everywhere and nowhere at once...

Would you like me to continue this dream sequence?
