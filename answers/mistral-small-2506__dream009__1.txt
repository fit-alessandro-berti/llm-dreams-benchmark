**Dream Continuation:**

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to survive in this unfamiliar world.

The air smells of damp earth and woodsmoke, and the distant sound of a blacksmith’s hammer echoes through the village. The buildings are made of timber and thatch, and people wear simple, handwoven clothing. You have no idea where—or *when*—you are.

Your first instinct is to find food and water. You spot a well in the village square and approach cautiously. A woman with a woven basket of herbs eyes you warily but doesn’t stop you from drawing water. You drink deeply, the cool liquid easing your thirst.

Next, you need shelter. A kind-faced elder notices your confusion and gestures for you to follow him. He leads you to a small, empty cottage at the edge of the village, offering it to you for the night. "Strangers are rare here," he says in a thick accent. "But you seem lost. Stay until you find your way."

As night falls, you sit by a crackling fire, listening to the villagers’ stories. They speak of wars, plagues, and ancient kings—none of which you recognize. You wonder if you’ll ever find a way back to your own time.

But for now, you must adapt. You’ll need to learn their ways, earn their trust, and uncover the secrets of this strange new world—before it claims you as its own.

**What do you do next?**

1. **Seek out a healer or wise person**—perhaps they know of time-traveling legends.
2. **Find work**—laboring in the fields or helping the blacksmith might earn you food and allies.
3. **Explore the wilderness**—maybe the answers lie beyond the village, in forgotten ruins or hidden paths.
4. **Try to return to where you first woke up**—if this is a dream, maybe reversing your steps will break the illusion.

The choice is yours. What path will you take?
