Yes, I can continue this dream with you!

The wind begins to howl through the ancient trees, sending leaves spiraling around you like golden butterflies. The once-warm sunlight is rapidly swallowed by towering storm clouds that seem to materialize from nowhere, their edges glowing with an otherworldly purple light.

Thunder rumbles not just overhead, but somehow through the very ground beneath your feet. The air crackles with an electric tension that makes your skin tingle. You notice the forest itself seems to be awakening—the trees beginning to sway and bend in impossible directions, their branches reaching out like arms trying to communicate something urgent.

Rain starts to fall, but these aren't ordinary raindrops—they shimmer with colors you've never seen before, each drop catching the last rays of dying light and creating tiny rainbows in the air around you. 

As you stand there in this impossible storm, you realize the forest isn't trying to frighten you. It's trying to show you something. The path ahead, the one you were following, begins to glow with a soft, ethereal blue light, leading you deeper into this magical woodland where weather itself seems alive and purposeful.

What do you feel called to do next in this dream?
