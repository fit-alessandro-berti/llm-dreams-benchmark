…to consult the skyline, desperately searching for anything – an impossible-looking tower, a giant purple parrot, anything that could whisper the location of this meeting.  It wasn’t a pretty city, not at all. Buildings curved in impossible angles, covered in moss that pulsed softly with a sickly green light. Cobblestones shimmered with heat, and the air smelled like burnt honey mixed with old rain and something indefinably sorrowful.  

Panic started to tighten its grip around my chest, a prickly heat alongside my skin. Looking around again, past the bizarre architecture, I noticed something… unusual. People. But they weren't *looking* at buildings. They were all meticulously arranging piles of perfectly formed pineapples on small, polished tables that seemed to sprout up spontaneously anywhere. Silhouettes against the violet dusk glowed, each figure entirely consumed by their pineapple arrangement obsession. 

Ignoring the rising knot of dread, I approached one – a woman with hair braided with marigots, meticulously centering a golden fruit. As I cleared my throat politely, she remained completely motionless, her fingers dancing across the tabletop. Finally, she looked up – not at *me*, but *at* a small, engraved wooden plaque attached to her table.

She read aloud in a strangely robotic voice, “Pineapple Placement: Designation – Section 7. Temporal Alignment - Beta 9.”

Then, without a flicker of emotion, she swiftly rearranged a tiny, wilting pineapple.  It struck me – this wasn’t a place for meetings. It was a place for… pineapple rituals? It dawangled me back to my task - I still had an hour, and I didn’t dare wander further. Trying to make sense of my situation – a dream, a pineapple obsession, a looming time urgency… I realized I had to act. I spotted a discarded roller bag, painted flamingo pink across its handle, at the side of the street.  Picking it up, I started frantically pushing it down the warped cobblestones, utterly bewildered, heading towards – where exactly? The engraving on the Roller bag read simply: “Destination: Uncertain." 

And as I rolled, the ground *felt* softer… like quicksand. Slowly, inexhorably, I sank down into the pulsating green moss. And the last thing I heard was the rhythmic clinking of tiny forks, used for arranging pineapples… a chorus of unnervingly precise and peaceful hands.
