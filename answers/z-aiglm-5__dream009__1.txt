...find a way to hide the glowing map etched onto the back of your hand.

In this world of candlelight and horse-drawn carriages, the soft blue light radiating from your skin feels like a beacon to anyone watching. You quickly pull your rough, woven sleeve down over your fist, your heart hammering against your ribs.

The street is a riot of mud and noise. Merchants shout in a language you somehow understand perfectly, selling pheasants and copper pots. The air is thick with the smell of woodsmoke and unwashed bodies. A guard in a steel breastplate turns the corner, his eyes scanning the crowd with a predatory sharpness. He is looking for something. He is looking for *you*.

You slip into the flow of peasants, keeping your head down, clutching your hidden hand to your chest. You realize you aren't just lost in time; you are being hunted. The light under your skin pulses warmer, tugging you toward the east, toward a spiraling stone tower that pierces the low-hanging clouds like a finger.

You know, with the strange, absolute certainty that only exists in dreams, that you must reach the top of that tower before the sun sets. You begin to run, your boots splashing through the puddles of the cobblestone street, the map on your hand burning brighter with every step, guiding you home.

Just as you reach the heavy oak doors of the tower, the ground beneath you gives way, turning into the soft foam of your mattress, and you jolt awake in the present day, your hand still tingling with the phantom heat of the map.
