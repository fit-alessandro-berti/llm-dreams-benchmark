**build a sanctuary.**

At first, it’s just a crumbling brick building with a half-collapsed roof, its walls covered in ivy and the skeletal remains of old graffiti. But something about it calls to you—the way the afternoon light slants through the broken windows, the way the wind carries the scent of wild thyme growing in the cracks of the foundation. This place could be *safe*. Or at least, safer than anywhere else you’ve been.

You start small. A firepit in the center of the main room, ringed with scavenged stones. A tarp strung up to catch rainwater. Then, the walls—you reinforce them with salvaged wood, metal sheets, anything that will keep out the cold and the things that hunt in the dark. You find a rusted shopping cart in an alley and haul it back, loaded with dented cans, a half-empty bottle of antibiotics, a child’s stuffed rabbit (you leave it by the fire; maybe someone will need it).

Word spreads. Not by design—you’re not foolish enough to advertise—but people *find* you. A woman with a broken arm and a knife she knows how to use. A teenager who can hotwire anything with wheels. An old man who remembers how to grow things in poisoned soil. They come in ones and twos, wary at first, but they stay when they see the garden you’ve started in the courtyard, the makeshift clinic, the way the fire never quite goes out.

Then come the harder choices. The raiders who demand "tribute." The sick you can’t save. The nights when the howls outside the walls sound almost human. You learn to barter, to fight, to bury the dead before dawn. But you also learn to laugh—over shared rations, over a stolen radio playing static-laced music from a world that’s gone.

One evening, as the sun bleeds into the horizon, you stand on the rooftop you’ve reinforced with scavenged rebar. Below you, the sanctuary hums—low voices, the clatter of pots, the distant sound of a child’s laughter. It’s not much. It’s everything.

And then you see it: a flicker on the horizon. A light, steady and unnatural, where there should be only darkness.

*Someone else is out there.*

Do you go investigate? Or do you prepare for what comes next?
