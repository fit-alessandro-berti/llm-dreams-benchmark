begin, but your mind suddenly goes blank. The words you prepared seem to have vanished without a trace. A wave of nervousness washes over you as sweat begins to form at the palms of your hands. You scan the room, meeting the eyes of a few acquaintances in the audience, but it only makes you more anxious.

Just as you're about to panic, you remember a few key points you wanted to discuss. You take a deep breath, trying to center yourself. You start speaking, and the words flow a little more smoothly than you expected. But as you continue, you notice that your hands are shaking slightly, and the hoarseness in your voice gives away your growing tension.

The audience, sensing your initial uncertainty, remains silent, perhaps a little uncertain of what to make of the unexpected turn. You know you need to regain their attention, to regain control. You take another deep breath, and then you change your approach. Instead of the rigid, memorized speech you had prepared, you decide to be more flexible, engaging more directly with the crowd.

You tell a brief, personal anecdote, and the audience begins to relax. You see nods of approval and smiles start to spread. You continue, weaving in stories and facts that connect with their experiences, making them feel more involved and less like passive listeners. As you reach the end of your speech, you falter slightly again, but you steeled yourself and finish with a strong emphasis on the key message you wanted to convey.

As you step down from the stage, the audience breaks into applause. You feel a mix of relief and a sense of accomplishment. You've done it. In the dream, at least, you've defied your initial fears and delivered a successful speech.
