…take a walk to cool off. The room feels too tight, syllables bouncing off the walls like rubber balls. You step outside and the street is a river, not metaphorically—a slow, glassy current sliding between parked cars. Your friend follows, shoes somehow dry atop the water, and you both drift along the curb like leaves.

“I can’t keep pretending this is fine,” you say, surprised to hear your voice float up as bubbles that pop into little bells. They chime your words back at you, out of order: fine keep can’t pretending. Your friend reaches up and plucks one, holds it to their ear.

“You always think we have to fix everything right now,” they reply, and their breath turns into a small kite that tugs at their wrist. “You don’t leave room for the wind.”

You want to argue, to itemize your reasons, but the river bends and becomes a hallway lined with picture frames. Each frame holds a moment you both survived together: the move, the loss, the first shared joke that lasted a year. Some frames are fogged over from the inside, like someone is breathing against the glass. You pause at one that shows your friend sitting on the floor of your kitchen, crying into a dog-eared cookbook, and remember how you were too afraid to sit down with them, how you thought standing made you useful.

“I’m not trying to fix everything,” you say, and the hallway floor turns to a keyboard. Each step plays a note, and the notes assemble your confession into a song you recognize, your shared ringtone from a time when you called each other daily. “I just don’t want to lose us because we were careful in the wrong direction.”

Your friend looks away, toward a window that wasn’t there, where a blue sky blinks like an eye. “And I don’t want to lose myself because I agreed faster than I understood.” They touch one of the fogged frames, and it clears to reveal both of you laughing under a broken umbrella, rain coming in sideways, cheeks wet, eyes bright. “We’re not the problem,” they add softly. “We’re the weather.”

The hallway keyboard modulates into a major key. You both laugh, a little—maybe at the music, maybe at the truth poking its head through like a cat. The river is a sidewalk again, then a carpet, then a kitchen tile floor, and you’re back where you began, except the walls have learned to breathe more slowly. The kettle on the stove lets out a sigh you mistake for your own.

“Okay,” you say. The word feels like setting down a heavy bag. “What if we write it down? What we need. Yours, mine. Then we circle what overlaps, underline what doesn’t, and we don’t decide about the underlined parts today.”

Your friend considers, eyebrow raised in the old familiar semaphore. “You, with a pen?” they tease, and your pocket warms. You pull out a pen shaped like a lighthouse, light blinking steadily. You didn’t put it there, but of course you did.

You both sit at the table. The paper is a map that unfurls by itself, coastlines you’ve walked together and some that haven’t been named yet. You write: time, honesty, rest. They write: space, tenderness, patience. The words crawl a little, like ants, then hold still. Where two words overlap, a small orchard grows—tiny trees with fruit shaped like hourglasses and open palms.

“What about this?” you ask, tapping a blank region where the map says Here Be Listening.

Your friend nods. “We can start there.” They reach across, their hand hovering in the middle, not demanding, not retreating. You set your lighthouse down between you, its pulse syncing with both your breaths.

Outside, weather considers its options. Inside, the kettle hums. The argument is still there, but it has shrunk to fit in a teacup, and you realize it always wanted to be held, not hurled.

“Tomorrow, we’ll probably forget some of this,” your friend says, smiling in the way that means they’re telling the truth you need most. “But we can remember on purpose.”

“Deal,” you say, and the map folds itself into a paper boat. You set it on the table. It sails a slow circle and comes back to you both, as if to prove it can.
