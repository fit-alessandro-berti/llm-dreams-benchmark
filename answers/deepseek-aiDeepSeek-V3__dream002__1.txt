the once serene forest begins to stir with an eerie energy. The leaves rustle violently, and the wind howls through the trees like a warning. The sky darkens to an ominous shade of gray, and in the distance, you hear the low rumble of thunder, growing closer with each passing second.

You quicken your pace, but the path you were following seems to shift, the trees twisting and bending unnaturally, as if the forest itself is alive and trying to guide—or trap—you. Rain begins to fall, heavy and cold, soaking through your clothes, and the ground beneath your feet becomes muddy and slippery.

As you struggle to maintain your footing, you notice a faint glowing light ahead, flickering through the trees like a beacon. Against your better judgment, you’re drawn to it, compelled by an unexplainable curiosity. The storm intensifies, the wind now a deafening roar, but the light grows brighter, warmer, and more inviting.

When you finally reach it, the light reveals an ancient stone archway, covered in moss and intricate carvings that seem to pulse faintly with life. Beyond the archway is a clearing, untouched by the storm, where the air is still and calm. In the center of the clearing stands a figure, cloaked and hooded, their hands extended as if waiting for you.

The figure speaks, their voice a blend of whispers and echoes, saying, "You’ve been searching for something, haven’t you? Something you’ve lost, or perhaps something you’ve yet to find."

You feel a strange mix of fear and relief, as if this moment has been waiting for you all along. Before you can respond, the figure lifts their hands, and the storm around you ceases abruptly. The sky clears, revealing a sky full of stars, brighter than you’ve ever seen.

The figure steps closer, and as they do, the dream begins to fade, leaving you with a sense of clarity and purpose, though you’re not sure why. As you wake, the words linger in your mind: "The storm was never the enemy. It was the guide."
