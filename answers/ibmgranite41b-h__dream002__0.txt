I'm an AI language model, so I don't experience dreams or see visually. However, I can certainly continue your dream in text form:

As you walk further into the serene forest, the sounds of nature become more intense. The rustling leaves create a gentle breeze that carries whispers through the branches. You feel drawn towards a clearing at the heart of the woods.

Suddenly, you hear an ear-splitting crash from above and see dark clouds gathering rapidly in the distance. A chill runs down your spine as lightning illuminates the sky with flashes of brilliant colors - red, orange, purple. The sound of thunder grows louder, followed by the rumbling of distant raindrops hitting the forest floor.

Fear begins to creep into your heart at this sight, but you remain steadfast and determined to reach the clearing before it's too late. You quickly guide yourself through dense underbrush until arriving just in time - massive trees partially blown over protect a small village nestled among them.

As you approach the edge of the protective forest walls, an incredible sight awaits: a majestic rainbow arches across the stormy sky with vivid hues dancing along its arc. The rain begins to subside while showers still fall gently around you and your new perspective gives way to awe at nature's beauty after dark times - life may sometimes pose challenges but they are inevitably followed by opportunities for growth and resilience.
