find a brush floating inches above it, suspended in midair. The brush glows faintly, and as you reach out and grasp it, a wave of warmth tingles through your fingers. Without knowing why, you begin to paint—not with paint, but with thoughts. Each stroke brings a memory, an emotion, a fleeting image from your deepest self onto the canvas.

The first line becomes a swirl of gold that shimmers with laughter from your childhood. A distant echo of your mother’s voice weaves itself into the curl of the paint. You smile without meaning to.

Shapes begin to emerge—spiraling towers, floating windows filled with clouds, and trees that sing lullabies. Colors meld and separate like oil on water: crimson sighs, emerald whispers, silver thoughts.

Suddenly, the canvas stretches out from its frame, expanding like a living map beneath your feet. You step onto it, and with each step you take, the world builds itself around you—crafted from imagination, yes, but also from memories long buried.

In the distance, there is a house—familiar, but impossible. Its walls are made of patchwork dreams; its roof, a midnight sky full of blinking stardust. You approach, and inside, someone is waiting. You can’t quite see their face, but you know them.

They speak without speaking:  
**"You’ve found the brush. Now paint your way home."**

The wind hums a lullaby, and as you raise the brush again, light spills across the world like a promise.
