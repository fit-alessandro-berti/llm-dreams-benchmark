navigate this unfamiliar time period carefully, as you have no idea how you arrived here or how to return to your own time. The air feels different, fresher somehow, and the chatter of voices around you carries words and accents that seem archaic but strangely familiar. The clothing of the people you pass—a mix of tunics, cloaks, and simple leather footwear—suggests you might be in a medieval town.

You stop in the middle of a bustling marketplace, where merchants are shouting about their wares. Wooden stalls are piled high with fruits, bundles of herbs, and handcrafted tools. The smell of bread baking in a nearby oven mingles with the earthy scents of the cobbled streets. You're struck by the richness of this world but also its barriers—your cellphone, wallet, and everything modern you rely on are gone.  

Instinctively, your fingers touch a heavy object tied around your neck beneath your clothes. It’s something you hadn’t noticed before: an intricate pendant forged in metal that doesn’t look like anything from your time. As you study its etched symbols, they shimmer faintly in the light, making you feel lightheaded for a moment. Could this object be the key to why you're here?

You realize that you need to learn to fit in quickly. Your modern mannerisms and speech might draw unwanted attention—or worse, suspicion. You decide to head toward a quiet area of town where you might overhear conversations and pick up the local dialect and customs. As you wander, you encounter a child with piercing, knowing eyes who tugs at your sleeve.

“They’re looking for someone like you,” the child whispers, glancing nervously over their shoulder. “You’ll need to hide, and you’ll need allies. Go to the innkeeper at the Black Boar. Ask for a room, and tell her you bring news of the ‘Raven’s Circle.’ Speak only to her. Quickly now!”

Before you can ask for more information, the child scurries off into the crowd, disappearing as quickly as they appeared. Your heart races. Who is looking for you? And why does it seem like someone here knows you—or at least expected you?

You debate whether to follow the child’s cryptic advice or to chart your own course. This is your dream’s crossroads. Will you trust the mysterious child and seek out the innkeeper at the Black Boar? Or will you ignore the warning and follow your instincts instead? The decision is up to you, but every choice seems to shift the dream’s landscape in subtle, almost imperceptible ways.

What will you do next?
