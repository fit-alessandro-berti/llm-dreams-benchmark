Here are three ways to complete this dream scene, reflecting common dream interpretations and emotional arcs:

### 1. **The Anxiety Route (Classic Stage Fright):**
   > ...you begin to speak, but no sound comes out. Your throat tightens. You glance down at your notes, but the words blur into gibberish. The audience's expectant smiles fade into confusion, then pity. You feel a wave of heat rush up your neck as you fumble with the microphone, which suddenly feels like ice. A spotlight burns down, isolating you in a pool of light while whispers ripple through the crowd like dry leaves.

### 2. **The Surreal Twist (Dream Logic):**
   > ...you begin to float gently upward, hovering a foot above the stage. The audience doesn’t react—they keep smiling as if this is normal. Your carefully prepared speech transforms into glowing, floating symbols in the air. You reach out to touch one, and it chimes like a bell. Suddenly, the microphone in your hand blooms into a sunflower. You laugh, and the crowd laughs with you, their faces now resembling friendly, familiar masks.

### 3. **The Empowerment Arc (Overcoming Fear):**
   > ...you take a deep breath, and a profound calm washes over you. Your voice rings out clear and strong, filling the auditorium effortlessly. The faces in the crowd soften into warm, attentive expressions. As you speak, your words flow like poetry, and you feel an electric connection with every person there. Halfway through, you realize you’re speaking without notes—sharing truths you didn’t know you possessed. The applause starts before you finish, swelling into a wave of sound that lifts you up.

**Why these resonate:**  
- **Anxiety:** Reflects real-life fears of exposure, judgment, or unpreparedness.  
- **Surreal:** Dreams often defy reality—absurdity can diffuse tension or symbolize detachment.  
- **Empowerment:** Represents subconscious confidence or a desire to master challenges.  

Which ending feels closest to *your* dream? Dreams often process unresolved emotions—consider what this moment might symbolize in your waking life (e.g., a new responsibility, hidden potential, or fear of visibility).
