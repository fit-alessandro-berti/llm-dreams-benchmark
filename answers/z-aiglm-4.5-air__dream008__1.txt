You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel your chest tighten. The air grows thick, and the fluorescent lights above flicker ominously. You glance at the project brief on your desk, but the words seem to melt and rearrange themselves into a pulsating, code-like creature made of spreadsheets and deadlines. It writhes, growing larger, threatening to swallow the entire office.  

Your boss’s face stretches into a grotesque mask, their smile too wide, their eyes hollow. "Start now," they hiss, but their voice echoes from every direction. The walls dissolve into a void, and you’re standing on a tightrope suspended over a chasm. The "project" creature coils around your ankles, its weight dragging you down. The deadline clock on its surface ticks backward at lightning speed, mocking you.  

You try to scream, but no sound escapes. The rope beneath your feet snaps, and you plummet into darkness. Just as you brace for impact, you wake up—gasping, heart pounding—in your bed. Sunlight streams through the curtains, and your cat purrs on the nightstand. Relief washes over you, until you notice your phone: a notification from your boss. It says, "The project deadline has been moved up. We need you to start now."  

You stare at the screen, the dream’s terror still fresh, as the impossible deadline bleeds into reality.
