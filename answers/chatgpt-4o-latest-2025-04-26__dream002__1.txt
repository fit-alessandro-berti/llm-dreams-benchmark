you hurry along the winding path, the leaves trembling around you. Thunder rumbles low in the distance, and a strange golden mist starts seeping between the trees. The mist feels warm and alive, humming softly as it curls around your ankles.

As the first drops of rain begin to fall, you spot a small stone archway ahead, half-hidden by vines. Drawn by an invisible force, you step through it â€” and the world shifts. The storm vanishes. You find yourself standing in a sunlit meadow where the grass glows faintly blue, and enormous butterflies drift lazily through the air, their wings shimmering like stained glass.

In the center of the meadow stands a giant tree with silver bark and deep violet leaves. Something glimmers at its base â€” a doorway, carved into the trunk, pulsing gently with light, as if waiting just for you.
