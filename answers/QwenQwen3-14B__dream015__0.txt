You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **plant a garden in the ruins of a long-abandoned library, where the cracked concrete floors and collapsed shelves form a strange kind of soil.** You scavenged seeds from a forgotten seed bank buried beneath the ashes of a collapsed greenhouse, and now, as you dig your hands into the dust, you feel a strange warmth beneath your fingertips—like the earth itself is remembering how to grow.  

A child appears beside you, no older than ten, with eyes the color of storm clouds and a ragged coat stitched from newspaper. They hand you a rusted tin can filled with something that glints like starlight. “My mom used to keep this,” they say, “but she’s gone. Maybe it’s magic?” You open it to find tiny, iridescent seeds that hum faintly when touched.  

As you plant them, the air shimmers, and the skeletal remains of the library begin to change—vines burst through broken windows, bioluminescent flowers bloom in the cracks, and the scent of rain-soaked soil fills the air, though no rain has fallen in years. The child smiles, their scars fading as if the garden is healing them.  

But then, a low growl rumbles from the shadows of the ruined city. A pack of feral, half-mechanical beasts emerges, drawn by the glow. The child grips your arm, whispering, “They’re not hungry. They’re *thirsty*.” You realize the garden isn’t just a symbol of hope—it’s a beacon, a lure.  

And in that moment, you decide to stay and protect it, not just for the child, but for the ghosts of the past and the fragile future that might yet take root here.
