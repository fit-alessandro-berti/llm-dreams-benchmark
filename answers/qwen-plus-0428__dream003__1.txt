You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns etched into the surface—geometric shapes that seem to shift when viewed from different angles. The box is made of a material that glows faintly under the dim light of your bedroom, and as you touch it, a soft hum resonates through your fingers. It feels alive, almost sentient.

A voice, not quite human, echoes in your mind:  
*"You are not alone."*

You step back, heart pounding. The room is silent, but the box still hums. You try to open it, but the lock won’t yield. A cold chill runs down your spine as you realize the box is not just a relic—it’s a portal.  

The patterns begin to pulse, forming a sequence of symbols that match the ancient script you’ve seen in forgotten texts. You follow them, and suddenly, the air around you begins to warp. Colors swirl, and the edges of your vision blur.  

Then, you’re no longer in your room. You are in a vast, endless void, surrounded by stars that blink like eyes. The box floats above you, pulsing with energy. Your feet touch the ground, but it’s not solid earth—it’s a surface made of liquid light.  

You look around, and the void seems to be shifting, responding to your thoughts. The symbols on the box are now glowing, and they begin to form words in an unknown language.  

*"To awaken the One who was never meant to be awakened."*  

You feel a surge of power coursing through you, and the void begins to contract. You can see the outlines of figures—ancient beings, their forms flickering like candlelight. They are watching you, waiting.  

As the void collapses around you, you hear the voice again:  
*"Your time is short. The One must be found, and the world must be changed."*  

The box falls into your hands, and for the first time, you understand. You are not dreaming. You are *awakening*.
