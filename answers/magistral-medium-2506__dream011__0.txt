Here’s a surreal continuation of your dream:

You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are **written in a language you’ve never seen before**. Strange symbols shift and shimmer on the page like ink in water. Panic rises, but before you can react, the invigilator leans in and whispers, *"The answers are inside you—you just have to listen."*

Suddenly, the exam hall dissolves. You’re standing on the edge of a vast, star-filled canyon, and the questions float in the air like glowing constellations. The first one pulses: *"What do you fear most about your future?"* Before you can think, your hands begin to move—writing not with a pen, but by rearranging stars into an answer.

A voice echoes: *"The test wasn’t about knowledge. It was about whether you’d show up when it mattered."*

Then, the ground tilts—you’re falling—but instead of hitting rock, you land on a feathered wing. The dream shifts again, and now you’re wearing a graduation cap made of fireflies, watching as the horizon folds into the shape of a door with your name on it.

Would you like it to take a darker turn, or keep this dreamlike wonder?

(Or if you’d prefer a more grounded continuation, let me know!)
