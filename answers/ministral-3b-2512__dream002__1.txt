**The Storm’s Whisper**

The sky darkens like ink spilled over water—thick, swirling clouds press in, their edges trembling with unseen force. The air hums with tension, the kind that makes your skin prickle. You glance back at the forest, its usual quiet now fractured by distant, guttural growls—like something vast and hungry is stirring beneath the roots.

A crack splits the canopy. Not lightning, not yet. Just the sound of something *ripping* through the trees—branches snapping, leaves curling into jagged shapes before they fall. The wind howls, not just from the storm, but from *inside* the storm, as if the air itself is breathing.

Then you see it.

A figure emerges from the mist, half-buried in the damp earth, its silhouette too tall, too *wrong*—like a tree grown into a person, its limbs twisting into the shape of roots. Its face is smooth, featureless, save for two glowing eyes that flicker like embers in the dark. It doesn’t move. It *waits*.

The storm surges forward. Rain lashes your skin, cold and heavy, but it’s not the rain that matters. It’s the *sound*—a low, rhythmic *thumping*, like something vast and slow is pounding against the earth beneath your feet. The ground trembles. The trees groan.

The figure steps forward.

Its voice is a chorus of whispers, overlapping in a language that isn’t quite words—more like the way the wind carries secrets. *"You were never meant to walk alone,"* it murmurs. *"The forest remembers. The storm is your guide."*

Then the ground splits open.

Not a fissure, but a *mouth*—a chasm of blackened earth, pulsing with something dark and wet. The figure reaches into it, and from the depths, something *else* rises—tentacles of shadow, veins of lightning, and at the center, a shape that isn’t quite alive, not yet. It’s waiting.

The storm’s wind howls your name.

And you realize, with a sinking dread, that you’ve been *chosen*.

**What happens next?**
- Do you try to flee, but the forest itself seems to resist?
- Does the figure offer a deal—truth, power, or something worse?
- Or do you wake up, only to remember this dream… and the way the trees *watched* you sleep?
