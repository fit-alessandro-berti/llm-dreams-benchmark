each group seems to be speaking in a different language—one you almost, but not quite, understand. The words blur and stretch, turning into swirling, colorful ribbons in the air. You move from circle to circle, hoping to spot your friend’s familiar face, but each time you think you catch sight of them, the crowd shifts and the person’s features morph into someone else.

At one point, a woman in a green dress offers you a slice of cake shaped like a clock. When you take a bite, the room tilts gently, and for a moment everyone’s laughter slows and deepens, like sound underwater. Your shoes feel strangely heavy, and you realize you are standing on a plush carpet that looks like a map—tiny rivers and forests winding beneath your feet.

You follow a winding path embroidered into the carpet, feeling sure it will lead you to your friend. The map leads you up a staircase that wasn’t there before, where balloons drift along the ceiling like jellyfish. At the top, you hear your friend’s voice calling your name from behind an ornate door. You reach for the handle, but it’s made of soft, warm wax and begins to melt beneath your fingers.

When you push anyway, the door swings open and you enter a sunlit room filled with the scent of oranges, music you almost remember, and your friend—smiling, as if you hadn’t been searching for them at all.
