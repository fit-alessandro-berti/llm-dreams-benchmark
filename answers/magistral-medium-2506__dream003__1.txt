symbols etched into its surface—some familiar, like ancient runes or celestial constellations, while others seem entirely alien, shifting subtly when you blink. A faint hum emanates from within, pulsing like a heartbeat.

You press your ear against the box, and a whisper slithers into your mind: *"The key is not lost... it was never made."* A cold shiver runs down your spine as the box suddenly grows heavier in your hands. The patterns begin to glow faintly, tracing a path with no end.

Then, without warning, the box’s latch clicks open—but it’s not empty. Inside, a mirror gazes back at you, reflecting not your face, but another version of yourself, eyes wide with terror, mouthing words you can’t hear. Behind them, a shadow stirs...

Do you reach inside? Or step back?

*(The dream could branch here—perhaps the box is a prison, a test, or a gateway. The choice could lead to revelation or ruin.)*
