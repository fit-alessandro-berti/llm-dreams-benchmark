...not written in words, but composed of moving images—tiny, looping videos playing within the lines of the paper. 

You pick up your pen, expecting to write an essay, but the ink hovers in the air above the page. The first question shows a montage of a life you don't remember living: you are standing on a stage in a city that looks like it’s made of crystal, addressing a crowd of faceless figures. The text beneath it doesn't ask for an analysis; it reads: *“Identify the hesitation.”*

You flip the page. The second question is a mirror. Staring back at you is not your current self, but an older version of you, wearing a heavy velvet robe. The reflection speaks, but the sound comes out as the hum of a cello string. 

You look up to ask the proctor for clarification, but the lecture hall has dissolved. The rows of desks are now floating lily pads on a dark, endless lake. The proctor is nowhere to be seen, replaced by a giant, floating hourglass where the sand is flowing upward, defying gravity.

A voice echoes over the water, calm and resonant: "The answer is not what you know, but what you are willing to forget."

You look back at your paper. The loop of the crystal city has changed. Now, the figure on the stage is holding the hourglass. You realize with a jolt that the exam isn't testing your knowledge—it's rehearsing your future. You grip the pen, which has now turned into a conductor's baton, and you prepare to direct the scene.
