You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the sky darkens with thick, rolling clouds, casting an ominous shadow over the trees. The wind picks up, causing the branches to sway and leaves to rustle fiercely. As lightning flickers across the sky, you notice a faint glow emanating from deeper within the forest. Intrigued and a little apprehensive, you decide to head toward the light, seeking shelter and perhaps uncovering the mystery behind the sudden change in weather.
