I raise the spyglass to my eye, though there is nothing to see but a wall of churning grey water. The ship groans beneath my boots, a living sound of stress and fear. Salt spray stings my face like needles.

"Steady!" I bellow over the wind, my voice tearing from my throat. "Hold the wheel, Finn! Keep her nose into the waves!"

I scramble across the slick deck, grabbing a rope to steady myself. The *Odyssey* is a good ship, but against this... this *wrath*... she is a mere toy. The mast bends like a bow, the sails are tattered rags.

Then, through the spray, I see it. It is not a lighthouse. It is not land.

It is a figure made of the storm itself—a vast, shadowy shape walking upon the water. It has no face, only a hollow where a heart should be, glowing with a sickly, pale light.

My crew is paralyzed. The horror of it grips them tighter than the wind ever could. I feel the fear, cold and sharp in my own gut. But I am the captain.

I draw my cutlass—not to strike the giant, but to signal. The steel flashes, catching the lightning.

"To me!" I scream, the sound swallowed by the thunder. "Do not look at the shadow! Look to the prow! We sail *through* it!"

I grab the helm from Finn and spin the wheel hard to port. The bow turns, creaking, aiming directly at the giant's chest. The sea rises up to meet us, a mountain of water.

"Brace for impact!"

As the hull lifts into the sky, poised on the crest of the wave, time seems to stop. The giant reaches out a hand of mist and rain. I wake up just before the impact, the feeling of falling jolting me back to reality.
