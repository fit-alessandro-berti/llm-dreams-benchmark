…though their faces are familiar, you can’t quite place who they are. The scene is vibrant yet oddly distorted: the music is too loud, yet the notes feel thick and slow in your ears; the clinking of glasses against polished marble tables happens at uneven intervals, as if each person is running on a private clock. You move through the gathering like someone drifting through smoke. A memory tugs at you—of someone you desperately need to speak with, that single friend who invited you here—but as you look around, the faces swirl together, forming and unforming like shapes in clouds.

Your first stop is a circle of guests near the edge of an indoor fountain. They look like art students and gallery owners, though this is no art gallery—just an enormous hall with rooms that lead off into darkness. Some have shirts splashed with paint; others wear all black and carry wooden frames under their arms. A woman with short green hair and wide glassy eyes steps forward, holding a miniature sculpture of a hand. The tiny hand’s fingers move on their own, beckoning you forward. You try to speak to her, to ask if she’s seen your friend, but she’s more interested in showing you the sculpture’s texture: rough stone that feels warm as flesh. The group murmurs approvingly and then, without warning, disperses, scattering like leaves. One of them points down a hallway lined with tall mirrors before they disappear altogether.

You follow the hallway. In the reflections of those tall mirrors, your clothes and face seem to shift with each step. Now you’re dressed in a tailored suit with lapels too wide. Now you’re in a long embroidered coat of deep violet velvet. Now your reflection shows not one but two silhouettes—yours and another person’s, just behind you, though when you turn, no one is there. Each mirror warps your image and the corridor lengthens. You think you hear your friend’s voice—soft laughter echoing from somewhere ahead. You hurry on.

At the end of the hallway, you enter a chamber lit by a glowing chandelier fashioned from twisted antlers. Beneath it stands a group of individuals who look like travelers from a distant time. Some wear cloaks fastened with ornate brooches; others have hats with large feathers. They speak in hushed, archaic tongues and gesture at maps drawn on handkerchiefs. When you approach, a tall man with a silver beard points to a corner of the room where several old suitcases are stacked. You realize that each suitcase has a name etched in gold on the handle. You inspect them, reading names you almost recognize—childhood friends, distant relatives, authors of old books you once loved. Your friend’s name must be here, but the letters keep rearranging themselves on the leather surfaces before you can catch them. Suddenly, the group of travelers gasp, as if they’ve discovered something crucial: they point toward a heavy wooden door at the back of the chamber. The door swings open by itself.

You walk through and find yourself in a lush garden illuminated by lanterns floating mid-air without strings. The scent of night-blooming flowers is overwhelming—honeysuckle, jasmine, and something you can’t name that makes you lightheaded. In the distance, you see a figure sitting under a large willow tree whose branches sway as though under a gentle breeze, though the air is perfectly still. The figure is hunched over, reading a book. As you get closer, you recognize your friend’s jacket, their posture, even the way they tilt their head when concentrating. Relief and joy surge through you.

But as you step into the soft glow of the lanterns, you realize something strange: your friend’s face is obscured by shifting patterns of light and shadow, as if they exist only in a half-remembered photograph. They look up and close the book carefully, placing a small bookmark shaped like a feather inside. You try to call their name, but you realize you can’t quite remember it. The moment you open your mouth to speak, the garden dims. The lanterns fade. All that remains is the silhouette of your friend, who stands and opens their arms.

They hand you the bookmark, pressing it gently into your palm. It’s warm, just like the sculpture’s stone hand was. Your friend’s voice is quiet but clear: “I’ve been here all along, waiting for you to see.” And then the scene begins to dissolve: the willow branches melt into the darkness, the lanterns blink out one by one, and you awaken with the imprint of a feather in your mind, as if some part of this dream—and the person you sought—has followed you out into the morning light.
