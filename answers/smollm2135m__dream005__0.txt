I am so trapped in an endless sea of possibilities between my two hands as I struggle to locate Mr. Emily from the bustling hallway scene we just shared earlier. My mind reels with visions of his past, perhaps those that lead through him but are not easily discernible yet, or maybe they're all intertwined?

Suddenly an older woman steps into the room above me, her long dark coat billowing behind her like a cloud, offering me shelter from the sunlight which still has been oppressive in this dream. With trembling hands she reaches behind me and grasps my shoulder tightly as I realize that he's not there. And who are we? Are we part of the group that formed their entrance despite having lost our way across the hall?

I attempt to reach for a lock of his hair, but unfortunately find myself stuck against it like it is holding its breath in anticipation.
