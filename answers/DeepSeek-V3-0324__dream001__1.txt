You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panic, your heart pounding as you fumble through your pockets for any clue—a note, a phone, anything. But all you find is a crumpled slip of paper with a single word: *"Observatory."*  

The streets twist and turn like a labyrinth, neon signs flickering in languages you don’t recognize. Strangers pass by, their faces blurred, as if you’re seeing them through frosted glass. You stop someone to ask for directions, but their reply comes out in slow, distorted syllables, like a record played backward.  

Then, you notice a shadowy figure in the distance—someone familiar, yet you can’t place them. They beckon you forward, and without thinking, you follow. The city’s noise fades into a hum as you’re led up a spiraling staircase, each step lighter than the last, until suddenly…  

You wake up. The alarm is ringing. The meeting was real. And you’re late.  

*(How would you like the dream to continue? Or would you prefer to explore its meaning?)*
