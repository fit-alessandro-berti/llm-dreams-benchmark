adapt to this unfamiliar time and figure out how to survive. The world around you is strikingly different—no electricity, no cars, and no trace of the digital age. Instead, there are the sounds of nature, bustling marketplaces filled with people dressed in period clothing, and a sense of community you’ve never experienced before.

At first, you feel out of place and overwhelmed. But as you interact with the people, you learn that your knowledge of modern science and problem-solving is seen as almost magical to them. They’re in awe of your ability to think in ways they’ve never imagined.

You start working with the local blacksmith to invent simple machines, using your understanding of chemistry to create basic cleaning solutions, and sharing ideas for organizing communities more efficiently. Over time, your actions begin to change the course of their small society, earning you respect and a unique place in their world.

The more you embrace this life, the more you wonder—do you even want to return to your own time? Or have you found your true purpose here, living in a world where your skills and ideas make a direct, tangible impact?
