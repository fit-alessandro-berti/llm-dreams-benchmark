 ...you decide to stop defending your position and instead reach out to touch the space between you. Your fingers sink into the air as if it were wet clay, and you realize the argument has a texture—rough and hot, like asphalt in August. 

You pull back, and strands of the disagreement stretch between your palms like molten glass. Your friend stops mid-sentence, their anger shifting to fascination. You both watch as the words you were throwing moments ago condense into a single, pulsing object hovering in the center of the room—a red, beating thing that looks almost like a heart, but made of clockwork and autumn leaves.

Without speaking, you both understand that you need to carry it somewhere. The walls of the room have dissolved into twilight, and now you're walking through a forest where the trees are actually the columns of a cathedral that was demolished years ago. The ground is soft with unsent letters. 

Your friend reaches out and takes half the weight. The object lightens immediately, turning from red to gold. You walk side by side, no longer angry, because in this place, the disagreement isn't something to win—it's a seed that needs to be planted. 

You find a hole in the earth that looks exactly like the shape of your combined shadow. Together, you lower the argument into the ground. As soon as it touches soil, it erupts into a tree that bears fruit made of stained glass. Each piece catches the light differently, showing the same memory: the two of you laughing on a porch swing that never existed in waking life, sharing a drink that tastes like forgiveness.

You wake up with the taste still on your tongue, metallic and sweet, knowing you'll call them in the morning.
