…walk away before either of you says something that can’t be taken back. As you turn, the scene around you ripples like water disturbed by a stone. The living‑room walls dissolve into a mist the color of dawn, and the floor beneath your feet becomes a narrow stone bridge stretching over a vast, still lake. Moonlight and sunlight somehow share the same sky, opposite halves of a perfect circle.

Your friend appears at the far end of the bridge, the argument still etched into their posture—shoulders high, fists tight. Between you, balanced on the railing, lies the object of your dispute: a small, glowing sphere that pulses with a soft heartbeat of light. Every pulse sounds like a word you both used again and again during the fight: “Listen… Listen… Listen…”

You begin to walk toward the sphere. Each step brings back fragments of the argument—your voice rising, your friend’s eyes narrowing—but also other memories: the first time you met, laughter in cafés, shared victories and quiet consolations. The bridge widens with each recollection, giving you both more room to stand.

Halfway across, you notice that the glow of the sphere changes color depending on which of you is closer—warm amber when you approach, cool blue when your friend does. When you stand side by side, the colors swirl into a shimmering violet. Without speaking, you both reach out and place a hand upon it. Instantly the bridge becomes transparent, revealing not water but a skyful of constellations beneath your feet, as though the two of you stand suspended between galaxies.

A breeze brings the smell of cedar and rain. Words arrive in your mind like silver birds: “What we argue for is less important than who we are while arguing.” You glance at your friend—they heard it too. The sphere warms, then dissolves into a cascade of fireflies that scatter into the twilight. In their brief glow you see reflections of yourselves: two travelers who once forgot the road was wide enough for both.

At that realization, the bridge merges back into the familiar living room. The argument’s echoes fade like music at the end of a song. Your friend’s eyes soften, and you feel the dream fold inward, carrying only a single word to waking consciousness:

“Listen.”
