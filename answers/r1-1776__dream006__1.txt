**Dream Continuation:**

...open your mouth, but no sound emerges. The words you’d rehearsed for weeks dissolve like smoke. Panic coils in your chest. The microphone hums faintly, amplifying your quickened breath. You glance down at your notes, but the pages are blank—ink spiraling into abstract shapes. A cold spotlight pins you in place.  

Then, a shift.  

From the back of the hall, a soft chime rings, like a windbell in a breeze. The crowd’s faces blur, softening into watercolor hues. You feel weightless, as if the stage has become a raft adrift on a calm sea. When you try to speak again, your voice returns—not as your own, but layered, echoing like a chorus. The words flow, unfamiliar yet profound, painting visions in the air: galaxies blooming above the audience, roots cracking through the floor, a symphony of light and shadow.  

The crowd leans forward, not in judgment, but wonder. A child in the front row reaches up, catching a glowing word in their palm. It bursts into a monarch butterfly, wings brushing your cheek as it flies toward the rafters. You laugh, and the sound ripples outward, unraveling the dream’s edges.  

As the stage dissolves into stardust, you whisper, *“This is how it begins.”*  

---  
*You wake just before learning what, exactly, begins.*
