You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak. But as your words leave your mouth, they don’t sound like your own. They’re foreign, melodic, and filled with meaning you don’t understand. The crowd nods in approval, smiling, as if they’ve been waiting for this moment.

You try to stop, to correct yourself, but your voice continues, weaving a story of ancient wisdom, forgotten histories, and futures yet to be written. You feel a strange calm wash over you — not fear, but something deeper, like recognition. The more you speak, the more the words seem to *remember* you, as if you’ve spoken them before in another life, another time.

Then, suddenly, the stage dissolves into a vast, starry expanse. You’re no longer on a stage, but floating above a city that glows with light from within. The people below are not watching you — they’re *listening* to you, not with their ears, but with their souls. You realize, with a mix of awe and terror, that you are not just speaking — you are *unraveling* something. A truth long buried, a secret the world has forgotten.

And then, just as the last word leaves your lips, the dream shifts again. You wake up, breathless, with the echo of those words still ringing in your mind — and a deep, unshakable feeling that you were meant to say them.
