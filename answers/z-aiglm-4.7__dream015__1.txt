Despite the hardships, you decide to **plant a garden.**

Not just any garden, but one in the crater of what used to be a downtown intersection, surrounded by the skeletons of skyscrapers. You reach into your pocket and pull out a handful of seeds that hum with a faint, blue bioluminescence. 

You kneel on the cracked asphalt, which feels strangely warm, almost like skin, and press the seeds into the dust. You don't have water, so you offer them your memories instead—a splash of recollection of rain, the taste of cold lemonade, and the feeling of grass between your toes.

Instantly, the ground shudders. Vines shoot up rapidly, spiraling upward with a audible *whoosh*. They aren't normal plants; their leaves are made of stained glass and their petals shimmer like oil on water. They wrap around the rusted husks of cars and streetlights, transforming the gray, desolate ruin into a kaleidoscope of refracted light.

From the shadows at the edge of the ruins, the dangers emerge. Creatures with too many eyes and jagged movements step into the clearing. You freeze, expecting an attack, but they stop. The bioluminescent glow of the garden soothes them. The monsters lay down in the flowering vines, purring like oversized cats, their eyes losing their hungry red glint.

You sit in the center of this impossible oasis, bathed in the light of a glass flower, realizing that in a world of dead things, you have become the lifeboat. Just as you reach out to touch a blooming bud that smells like vanilla and ozone, the sky overhead tears open, revealing not stars, but a vast, watching ocean, and you drift upwards into the deep.
