lose track of your words as your mind wanders to the strange and surreal landscapes of a dream. The stage beneath your feet begins to ripple like water, and the audience's faces blur into shifting patterns of colors and shapes. You try to steady yourself, but the microphone in your hand transforms into a feather, floating gently upwards. The room fills with the sound of distant waves, and suddenly you're not speaking to an audience at all—you're standing on a sandy shore, watching the sunrise paint the sky in hues of pink and gold. The crowd has become a flock of birds, taking flight as you smile, realizing that in this dream, there are no expectations, only possibilities. You take a deep breath, and the words you need appear, not as a speech, but as a song carried on the wind.
