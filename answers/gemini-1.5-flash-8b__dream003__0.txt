You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and glowing runes carved into its surface.  They seem to pulse with a faint internal light, a light that shimmers and shifts, mirroring the shifting colours of the setting sun outside your window.  A faint, almost imperceptible hum emanates from the box, resonating with a rhythm that seems to match the beating of your own heart.  You trace a fingertip over one of the runes, a swirling vortex of emerald green, and a whisper, soft as a sigh of wind through tall grass, seems to echo in your mind:  "Find the echo."

Confused, you look around the room.  The room, once ordinary, now seems imbued with a strange energy.  The furniture seems to subtly shift in position, the shadows deepen and lengthen, and the very air itself seems to vibrate with a hidden power.  You notice a small, dusty, leather-bound book tucked under a forgotten chair. Its cover is cracked and faded, but the gold lettering on the spine catches the pulsating light from the box.  You open it to a page filled with faded ink sketches and diagrams.  A single, intricate diagram shows a series of symbols, each one linked to a specific location in the room.  One symbol directly corresponds to a hidden alcove behind a tapestry on the far wall.

Cautiously, you pull the tapestry away, revealing a small, perfectly circular opening in the wall.  It too, seems to glow with a soft internal light, matching the runes on the box.  As you peer into the opening, you see a narrow passage leading into darkness.  The hum from the box intensifies, becoming a steady, resonant thrum. The whisper in your mind becomes clearer: "Find the echo."   You feel an irresistible urge to follow the passage.  The air grows cold.  The pulse of the box seems to be drawing you, pulling you deeper into the unknown.  You take a hesitant step, and the dream fades to black, leaving only the lingering feeling of the box's persistent hum in your ears.
