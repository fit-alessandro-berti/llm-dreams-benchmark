symbols that shimmer and shift like living tattoos, whispering forgotten languages into your mind. Your fingers trace their curves, and suddenly, the box pulses with warmth, humming a melody that echoes the rhythm of your heartbeat.

No key? No problem. In dreams, locks yield to will. You press your palm flat against the lid, and it clicks open with a sigh, releasing a swirl of iridescent mist that tastes like stardust and childhood secrets.

Inside lies not treasure, but a mirror—your reflection staring back, but older, wiser, with eyes that hold the weight of unlived lives. "Choose," it says, offering two paths: one glowing with fireflies and laughter, the other shadowed with thorns and thunder.

You reach for the light, and the box snaps shut. The room dissolves into feathers and fog. You wake with the melody still humming in your chest, the box vanished—but the choice? That's yours to make today.
