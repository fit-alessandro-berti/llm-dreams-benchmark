...you realize you aren’t holding a brush, but a prism made of frozen moonlight. 

As you touch the prism to the white space, it doesn't leave a mark of ink or oil. Instead, it drips *sound*. A deep, resonant cello note bleeds onto the canvas in a shade of velvet violet, and where the sound spreads, the fabric begins to ripple like the surface of a pond.

You reach into a passing stream of orange geometry—a school of floating triangles that hum like bees—and catch one. You press it into the violet ripples. The canvas inhales the shape, and suddenly, the 2D surface gains depth. It becomes a window. 

Through the frame, you see a forest where the trees are made of glass and the leaves are memories you haven't had yet. You feel a pull in your chest, a gentle gravity emanating from the center of your creation. The world behind you—the kaleidoscope of shifting chaos—begins to pale and blur, turning into a faint mist.

You step forward, lifting your foot over the wooden edge of the frame. Your toes sink into the silver moss of the painted world. As you pull your other leg through, the canvas expands, stretching until it swallows the horizon. 

Now, you are no longer the observer. The colors have stopped changing because you have finally given them a place to land. You look down at your hands and see they are glowing with the same soft light as the prism. You realize that in this place, you don't just see the dream—you are the hand that decides what happens when the light hits the shadows. 

You take a breath, and the entire forest exhales with you. You turn around to look back, but the canvas is gone. There is only the path ahead, paved with the colors you chose.
