…set out on a journey beyond the ruined city you’ve been calling home. The hollowed-out husks of concrete towers loom behind you, their charred skeletons silhouetted against a waning sun. The wind that rattles through their empty windows carries the faint smell of rust and decay, and you can sense eyes watching from the shadows. But you move on. You must.

You pick a careful path through broken asphalt and twisted rebar, past the overgrown shells of automobiles left abandoned where they stopped running decades ago. There is a weight around your waist: your meager supplies. A canteen of brackish water, half a pack of scavenged crackers, a handmade knife hammered out of sheet metal, and a dented compass that sticks more often than it points true. Still, it’s enough to begin.

Your destination is uncertain—rumors speak of a settlement farther east, a place where seeds are planted rather than stolen, where people share more than they hoard. Even if these are just stories, you feel compelled to try. The road you walk is treacherous. Once-great highways have broken like bone, leaving jagged edges to trip you. Signs swing uselessly, their painted directions scoured by sand and time.

As twilight sets in, you come upon an overgrown parking lot. Through the creeping vines and wild grasses, you make out the silhouette of an old diner, its neon sign tilted and missing letters. You approach carefully, knife in hand. The floor inside crackles with dried leaves. There’s a moldy smell and a faint trace of something else—chemical, artificial, as if part of it never decomposed. In a corner booth, beneath a collapsed section of ceiling, you see the form of someone huddled in a tattered blanket. They are so still that for a moment you think they might be another lifeless mannequin of the old world. But when you step on a creaky floorboard, their eyes snap open, bright and alert, reflecting the last dim light from outside.

You raise a hand, showing you mean no harm. The stranger’s knuckles tighten around a broken-off table leg they hold like a club. For a tense moment, the two of you regard each other, silent in the half-darkness. Then, slowly, they lower their weapon. You introduce yourself, voice hushed, and explain your purpose: you are traveling east, looking for a place where people might stand together rather than alone. You offer them a swig from your canteen. They sniff it warily, but eventually accept.

The stranger’s name is Mara—at least, that’s what they say. They’ve heard the same rumors, though they tried to dismiss them as wishful thinking. For weeks, they’ve been stuck here, nursing a twisted ankle and unable to move on, living off what few scraps of canned goods they had left. Now, in you, they see a chance, slim but shining. Two people stand a better chance against the wilderness than one.

The night grows colder, and you both decide to share the diner’s decrepit shelter. Above you, the wind howls through shattered windows and blackened rafters. Each gust rattles the abandoned furniture, as if ghosts are rummaging through memories. Outside, maybe feral dogs or human raiders roam under the moonless sky, but for now, the booth becomes your fortress. Mara shows you a secret compartment beneath the counter where a few unopened cans of beans remain. You share a meal—metal spoons clinking softly, each bite a rare comfort in this hungry world.

Come morning, the two of you set out together, forging a cautious alliance. Beyond the diner, beyond the cracked lots and twisted metal heaps, you face the unknown. You travel under low, brooding clouds, whispering quietly about the world that was and wondering if something better can still be built. There is fear, yes. There always will be. But there is also hope, a gentle current pushing you forward. It may not be much, but it’s enough to keep you walking, hand steady on the knife, heart steady in its purpose—searching for that elusive place where, despite all odds, life can begin anew.
