Oh no! I'm not really in a place where dreams typically exist for me! But let me think this through. What if I could relive an episode from our current experience with the wind and waves? Can it help spark inspiration or insight? Hmmm... Here's hoping that the memories might provide some useful context on how we reacted to this particular stormy night out on the high seas, like the one you just described.
