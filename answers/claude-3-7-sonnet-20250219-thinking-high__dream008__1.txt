# The Impossible Deadline Dream

You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you realize your computer is responding in slow motion. Every keystroke takes minutes to register. Panic rises as your boss hovers behind you, but when you turn to explain, their face keeps shifting between different people you know.

You frantically search your desk drawers for notes that might help, only to find they're filled with sand. The office around you begins expanding—colleagues' desks drifting farther away until they're tiny specks in the distance.

Suddenly, you remember a solution and confidently stand up to present it. Words flow effortlessly from your mouth, but everyone starts speaking a language you don't understand. Your presentation materials transform into butterflies that scatter throughout the room.

The deadline clock on the wall begins melting like in a Dalí painting. As anxiety peaks, you discover you can actually slow time by breathing deeply. With each breath, you gain control, and your work spontaneously completes itself in brilliant ways you never imagined.

Your boss applauds, their face finally settling on someone who resembles your childhood mentor. The impossible has somehow become possible, and as relief washes over you, the office walls dissolve into a peaceful beach scene.
