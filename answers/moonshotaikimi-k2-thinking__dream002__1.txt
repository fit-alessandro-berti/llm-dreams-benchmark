—you feel the pressure drop in your bones before the first gust reaches you. The trees begin to hum in a frequency that makes your teeth ache. Their bark darkens, becoming slick like wet stone, and their leaves invert to show silver undersides that weren't there before.

The path ahead forks, but both directions look identical except one is filled with static, like a television channel tuned to nothing. The first raindrop hits your forehead, but it's warm and heavy as molasses. When you wipe it away, your hand comes back stained the deep blue of indigo ink. 

The storm isn't just approaching—it's *remembering* you, and with each flash of lightning that shows no visible source, you recall fragments of a memory that might not be yours: the taste of iron, the sound of pages tearing in reverse, the certainty that you left something important here in this forest, something that is now waking up.

You turn to go back, but your footprints have already been washed away by rain that hasn't fallen yet.
