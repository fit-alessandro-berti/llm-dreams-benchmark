**Dream Continuation:**

The air hums with laughter and clinking glasses, the scent of spiced wine and roasted herbs thick in the golden twilight. You weave through the crowd, your fingers brushing against unfamiliar sleeves—some warm, some cold—as if the gathering itself is breathing. The music shifts, a sudden shift from a waltz to something wild and rhythmic, and the room seems to pulse in time with it.

A group of strangers stands near a long table laden with silver platters. A woman with ink-stained fingers is arguing animatedly with a man whose coat is embroidered with constellations. *"The stars don’t lie,"* she insists, tapping a finger against a map of the night sky pinned to the wall. *"But neither do dreams."* The man smirks, offering her a goblet of something iridescent. *"Then let’s see whose version holds up."*

You hesitate, then step closer. The woman notices you and raises an eyebrow. *"Lost, little moth?"* she asks, but her tone isn’t unkind. *"Or just waiting for the right flame?"* Before you can answer, a child—no older than eight—darts between your legs, clutching a lantern that flickers with blue fire. *"They’re hiding in the library,"* the child whispers, then vanishes into the crowd, leaving only the scent of burnt sugar in their wake.

The library? But this isn’t a house—it’s a grand hall with no doors, no shelves, just endless corridors of flickering candlelight. You turn back to the woman, but she’s already gone, absorbed into the press of bodies. The man with the star coat is now dancing with a woman whose shadow stretches unnaturally long, as if the room itself is bending around them.

Then you see *them*—your one known person, standing beneath a chandelier that drips wax like tears. They’re laughing, but their face is half-obscured by a mask of polished bone. When they catch your eye, they mouth two words: *"Don’t trust the clock."*

The gathering dissolves around you. The music stops. The air turns thick, like syrup. And then—

You wake up.

But the dream lingers. The child’s lantern still glows faintly in your palm. And somewhere, a clock ticks backward.
