Okay, I'm there. The sky is a bruised purple, streaked with sickly yellow clouds that never seem to move. The wind whispers through the skeletal remains of buildings, carrying dust that tastes of old sorrow and something acrid, like burnt circuits. My clothes are patched, my stomach hollow, and the silence is only broken by the scuttling of unseen things or the distant, mournful howl of... well, I don't want to think about what makes that sound.

Despite the hardships, I decide to **build a treehouse.**

Not just any treehouse, but one in the petrified, towering remains of what might have once been a colossal oak, now blackened and smooth as obsidian. It's a ridiculous notion. There are no living trees, no fresh lumber. But in my dream-logic, the idea is a burning ember of defiance.

I scavenge. Rusted corrugated iron sheets, lengths of twisted rebar that groan when I try to bend them, surprisingly intact car doors that still have a faint scent of imitation leather. Each piece feels impossibly heavy, yet I drag them, one by one, to the base of the dead giant.

The act of building is strange. The materials seem to warp and meld at my will, not with tools, but with focused thought. A rusted sheet becomes a sloping roof, its edges surprisingly neat. Rebar weaves itself into a sturdy ladder, its rungs warm to the touch. The car doors become walls, their windows looking out onto the desolate landscape like unblinking eyes.

I'm not alone for long. First, a scrawny, one-eyed cat, its fur the color of the perpetual twilight, appears. It doesn't meow, but stares with an unnerving intelligence before leaping effortlessly onto the half-finished platform, curling up as if it owns the place. Then, a child, no older than seven, with eyes too old for their face, silently offers me a handful of glowing fungi – the only source of light in this gloom. They don't speak, just point towards a dark opening in the treehouse, indicating it should be placed inside.

Slowly, my ridiculous treehouse becomes a beacon. Not of safety, not yet, but of… something else. Curiosity? Maybe even a flicker of forgotten hope. Other shadowy figures, gaunt and wary, begin to gather at a distance, their forms indistinct in the gloom, drawn by the soft, pulsing light of the fungi and the impossible structure taking shape.

The wind still whispers, but now, mingled with its sorrowful tune, I think I can hear the faintest, almost inaudible hum. It's not coming from the treehouse, but from *within* the petrified wood itself, as if my act of creation is stirring something ancient and dormant deep inside.

The dream isn't over, I can feel it. The treehouse isn't finished, and the dawn, if it ever comes, is still a long way off. But for now, I have a purpose, a cat, a silent child, and the curious eyes of the lost watching me work under a bruised sky. And that, in this world, is everything.
