grip the wheel until my knuckles turn the color of bone beneath translucent skin. The wood groans—not from strain, but from *singing*, a low whale-song that vibrates through my sternum. I look down at my hands and see they are becoming barnacled, ancient, fused with the brass spokes.

"The charts are bleeding," my first mate says, and indeed, the ink is running, turning the Atlantic into a wash of indigo that drips upward into the sky. The crew doesn't have faces, only lanterns where their heads should be, swinging in the wind, casting long gold rectangles across the deck that pool like honey.

I open my mouth to give an order—*batten* or *reef* or *abandon*—but what comes out is a sound I've never made while waking: a frequency that makes the waves pause, mid-crest, suspended like glass sculptures. The storm isn't angry; it's *curious*, leaning in close with breath that smells of ozone and childhood bedrooms.

"Steady," I whisper, but the word expands, filling the sails with purple silk instead of canvas. The ship begins to lift—not sinking, but *unmooring* from the water entirely. The crew raises their lantern-heads in salute as we rise through the cloud ceiling, and I realize with that strange dream-certainty that we were never meant to survive the sea, but to *transcend* it.

Below us, the storm closes like a healing wound, and ahead—where the horizon should curve—there is a door I recognize from a house I haven't visited in twenty years. I turn the wheel toward it, and the stars above us are suddenly very close, humming a lullaby in a language I am just beginning to remember.
