You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panic, scanning the skyline for any familiar landmarks, but the towers twist into impossible geometries, their surfaces shimmering like liquid glass. The streets beneath your feet pulse faintly, as if alive, and the air hums with a low, resonant frequency that vibrates in your bones.  

A street vendor nearby yells in a language that sounds like a melody, tossing handfuls of glowing coins into the air. They land in your path, and you instinctively pick one up. It’s warm, almost like a heartbeat. When you open your hand, the coin dissolves into a map—faded and smudged, but the coordinates point to a place you’ve never seen: a square where a clock tower should be, but instead there’s a mirror-like pool reflecting a sky that’s both day and night.  

You sprint toward it, weaving through crowds that part like water. The city seems to shift as you move—buildings stretch or shrink, alleys loop back on themselves. A child points you toward a bridge made of tangled roots, but when you reach it, the other side is a desert under a violet sun. You’re running now, breathless, the coin’s map fading in your mind.  

Just as you think you’ve lost all sense of direction, a voice echoes behind you: *“The meeting isn’t in the place—it’s in the absence of it.”* You freeze. A figure materializes in the mist, cloaked in shadows, their face hidden. They gesture to the pool, now rippling with your reflection. You see yourself, but not as you are—older, wearier, standing in a room that isn’t there. The meeting was never about location. It was about *this* moment, the chaos, the search.  

The clock tower’s chimes ring out, and the city dissolves. You wake up, heart racing, in your bed—still wearing the coin, now cold in your palm.
