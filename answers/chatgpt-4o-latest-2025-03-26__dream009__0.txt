…blend in quickly to avoid attracting attention. The sun is high in the sky, casting golden light over cobblestone streets lined with horse-drawn carts and bustling vendors. The people around you are clothed in roughspun linen and wool, speaking in a dialect that sounds vaguely familiar, but with curious inflections.

You catch your reflection in the rippling surface of a nearby water trough—your clothes are far too modern. You slip into a nearby alleyway to get your bearings. First, you need to gather information: *Where—and when—exactly am I?*

As you step back onto the street, you approach a kindly-looking woman selling apples from a wooden cart. “Excuse me,” you say cautiously, trying not to reveal your confusion. “What day is it?”

She tilts her head and laughs, rosy cheeks crinkling. “The feast of Saint Bartholomew, of course! Summer’s nearly gone, child. Though you speak strangely—are you from the northern coast?”

You nod quickly, seizing the opportunity. “Yes! Just arrived.”

Your next goal becomes clear: find clothing to blend in, figure out how you got here, and—if possible—determine how to get back. But as you wander deeper into the village, something strange catches your attention.

At the edge of the market stands a tall stone building, likely a church, but atop its steeple is a symbol that makes your pulse quicken: three interlocking rings, glowing faintly blue.

You know that symbol. It’s not from this era.

Somehow, someone—or something—else is here too.

Now, the dream world feels less like a fantasy and more like a mission.

And you wonder: *Am I supposed to be here… or was I sent here for a reason?*
