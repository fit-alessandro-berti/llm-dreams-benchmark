You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panic, but then you notice a strange, glowing map floating in the air in front of you. It seems to respond to your thoughts, and as you focus on the meeting, the map begins to shift and change, highlighting a path through the city. You follow the glowing trail, weaving through bustling streets, past towering skyscrapers, and into narrow alleyways. Along the way, you encounter peculiar characters—a talking cat offering cryptic advice, a street performer who juggles glowing orbs, and a mysterious figure in a long coat who seems to be watching you. Just as you think you’re about to reach your destination, the map flickers and disappears, leaving you standing in front of a door you’ve never seen before. You take a deep breath, open the door, and step into a room filled with people you’ve never met but somehow feel you’ve known forever. The meeting begins, and you realize this is exactly where you were meant to be all along.
