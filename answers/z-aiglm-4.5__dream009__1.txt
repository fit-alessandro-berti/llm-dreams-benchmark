air hits your lungs first—thick, heavy with the scent of woodsmoke, damp earth, and something unfamiliar, like damp wool and crushed herbs. You sit up, your hands sinking into粗糙, rough-woven fabric beneath you. You're lying on a low, hard pallet in a small, dim room. The walls are thick, undressed stone, lit only by a single, flickering tallow candle in a crude iron holder. Outside, muffled sounds filter through – the lowing of cattle, distant hammering, the creak of wood.

Panic claws at your throat. Your phone. Gone. Your watch. Gone. The smooth glass and plastic of your modern world... vanished. You scramble to your feet, your modern clothes feeling absurdly soft and out of place against the粗糙 textures. You push open a heavy, uneven wooden door.

Stepping outside is like stepping onto a movie set, but terrifyingly real. A narrow, muddy track stretches before you, flanked by wattle-and-daub buildings with thatched roofs. Chickens scratch furiously in the dirt. A man leads a heavily laden ox-cart past, nodding gravely but saying nothing. Women in coarse linen dresses carry buckets hung from wooden yokes across their shoulders. The sun feels different, brighter, casting sharp, long shadows. The silence is profound, broken only by animal sounds, human voices without amplification, and the sigh of the wind through nearby trees.

You need to **understand where you are. When you are.** A cold dread settles in your stomach. Fear is useless; it won't find you water or shelter. You need to **orient yourself.**

You approach a woman laying out herbs to dry on a flat stone. You try to speak, but your words feel clumsy, too fast. "Excuse me? Where... where is this place?"

She startles, eyeing your strange clothes with wide, wary eyes. She mutters something thick and guttural, unlike any language you've heard, and quickly gathers her herbs, scurrying into her hut. Communication is a barrier. You need to **observe, to learn without words.** You watch the flow of life. The sun, low in the east, suggests it's morning. The tools are simple: iron axes, wooden plows, rough pottery. The architecture screams pre-industrial, perhaps medieval? Earlier?

You need to **blend in, at least superficially.** Your bright synthetic colors scream "other." You spot a pile of discarded, heavy burlap sacks near a barn. Grabbing one, you try to fashion a rough cloak, pulling the hood low. It scratches, but it’s better than being a beacon. You need to **find the center of this community,** the place where information flows. That usually means a market or a place of worship.

Following the deeper ruts in the muddy track, you walk towards more sounds. The path widens into a bustling marketplace. The sensory overload is immense: the pungent smell of fish, freshly baked rough bread, tanned leather, sweat, and woodsmoke. The noise is a cacophony of haggling voices, animal bleats, hammering metal, and the rumble of cart wheels on packed earth. Stacks of vegetable wares, crude metal tools, rough pottery, live chickens in wicker cages – it's a world of raw materials and direct human labor.

You need to **find out the date.** How? Without a calendar? You scan the crowd, searching for anything recognizable. Then you see it. A merchant weighing coins on crude scales. As he hands some back to a customer, you catch a glimpse in his palm – crudely stamped silver coins. One bears the profile of a heavy, bearded man wearing a laurel wreath. Not a Roman emperor... the features feel older, wilder. Your jumbled knowledge flickers. Early medieval? Pre-Norman? Saxon? Viking? The possibilities are dizzying.

You need to **get your bearings and secure basics.** Water. You spot a well in the center with a long wooden sweep. Food. The smell of bread is torture. Safety. Who is in charge here? You see men carrying spears, leather tunics over their clothes – some kind of watch or militia? You can't afford to seem like a threat or a fool.

You need to **bide your time and listen.** You drift towards the well, pretending to search for something in your makeshift cloak. You listen to the snatches of conversation around you. Names of places sound vaguely familiar... "Wintanceaster"? Winchester? The dialect shifts, but you catch fragments: "King Aethelred," "Danish ships," "tribute." Your heart pounds. *Aethelred the Unready? Late 10th, early 11th century? England?*

As you lean against the cold stone of the well, clutching your rough burlap, the immense reality crashes over you. No antibiotics. No sanitation. Life is harsh, short, and governed by forces you barely understand. But you're here. Alive. And amidst the fear and disorientation, a spark flickers. This is real. This is *now*. You need to **survive.** And beyond that... you need to **discover** what this strange, ancient dream holds for you. A man watches you sharply from across the square, his hand resting near the hilt of his seax. The market swirls on, oblivious to the anachronism in its midst. The next step is yours.
