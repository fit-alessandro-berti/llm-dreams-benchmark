…walk down a broad, gleaming avenue, hoping some landmark or sign might jog your memory. The buildings are impossibly tall, shimmering with colors that seem to shift like oil on water. The air hums faintly — not with machinery, but with a low, musical tone, as if the city itself is breathing.  

You check your pockets for clues. In one, you find a crumpled scrap of paper with only a single word written in looping handwriting: **“Aperture.”** You’re certain it’s connected to the meeting, though you can’t recall how.  

As you turn a corner, the street bends in unexpected ways — angles folding in on themselves, paths leading up toward the sky before looping back down like ribbons. The pedestrians you pass smile knowingly at you, some pausing to offer strange, half-finished directions: *“Follow the glass stairway until the air tastes like thunder.”* Or *“Don’t take the crimson bridge unless you’re ready.”*  

A clock tower in the distance catches your eye. Its hands spin erratically, yet your pulse insists you are running out of time. You start moving faster, weaving through the crowd, until you come to a great staircase made of clear crystal. When you step onto it, you notice your reflection in its surface looks older—years older—and the version of you in the reflection mouths words silently:  

> “You’ve been here before.”  

Do you want me to continue the dream from here in an **otherworldly** way or keep it more **grounded and realistic**?
