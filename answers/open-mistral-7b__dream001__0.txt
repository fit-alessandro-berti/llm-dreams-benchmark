panic a little, glancing at your watch to see the minutes ticking away. You decide to ask for directions, approaching a group of people gathered around a street map. As you approach, you notice they are speaking in a language you don't understand. Feeling a sense of frustration, you try to remember any basic phrases from the language classes you took in college.

Just as you open your mouth to speak, a kind-looking stranger approaches you, noticing your distress. Seeing the map in your hand, they offer to help. You explain your situation and show them the address of your meeting. The stranger looks thoughtful for a moment, then pulls out a small, old-fashioned map from their pocket.

They begin to trace a route with their finger, explaining each turn and landmark in a clear, slow voice. As you follow their instructions, you start to feel a little more confident. You thank the stranger and set off on your journey, feeling grateful for their kindness and the help they've given you.

The city is beautiful, with wide avenues, grand buildings, and lush parks. You pass by street performers, vendors selling delicious-smelling food, and people going about their daily lives. The city seems to come alive around you, and you can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder.

Eventually, you arrive at your destination, a sleek, modern building with a large sign out front. You take a deep breath, feeling a sense of relief. You've made it on time, thanks to the kindness of a stranger and your own determination.

As you enter the building, you can't help but feel proud of yourself. You may have been lost and unsure, but you've managed to navigate a strange city and make it to your meeting on time. You take a seat and wait for the meeting to begin, feeling more confident and capable than ever before.
