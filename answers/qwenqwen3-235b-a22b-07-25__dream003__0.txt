...as you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and symbols etched into its surface—swirling lines that seem to shift when you blink, constellations you've never seen before, and ancient runes that hum faintly under your fingertips. The box feels warm, almost alive.  

You run your hands along the sides, and as your fingers trace a spiral near the corner, the carvings begin to glow with a soft amber light. A voice—neither male nor female, but like wind through hollow flutes—whispers from within: *"Only what is already known can unlock what has been forgotten."*  

Puzzled, you close your eyes and focus on a memory, any memory—your grandmother’s lullaby, the smell of rain on pavement, the first time you saw the ocean. The moment you recall the melody she used to sing every night, the patterns flare brighter, rearranging themselves like living ink. The lid clicks open with a slow, deliberate sigh.  

Inside, there is no object—only a mirror. But the reflection isn't yours. It's you as a child, standing in a sunlit field, holding a key that glows like a captured star. The child smiles and tosses the key toward you.  

It sails through the air, passing through the dream and into your waiting hand. The box vanishes. The dream begins to unravel at the edges, but the weight of the key remains—solid, real, echoing with possibility.  

And somewhere, deep in the waking world, a lock stirs in the dark.
