are terrified that you won't be able to deliver on time. As you begin working on the project, everything seems to be falling apart - files get corrupted, calculations are incorrect, and important details keep slipping your mind.

Your alarm starts ringing as soon as night falls, reminding you of the deadline. Panic sets in as you frantically type away at the screen, trying to fix any errors that appear along the way. Your hands shake with anxiety as every keystroke seems to echo louder than before.

As you're about to submit your work for review, suddenly one last error pops up - a crucial component missing from the final output. Desperation fills you as you scramble through files in search of what's needed but it's nowhere to be found. The deadline looms closer by seconds while everything spirals into chaos within your mind.

Just when all hope seems lost and failure is imminent, an urgent realization strikes- there was never any impossible deadline after all; instead, it was just a figment of the imagination brought upon you during this nightmarish dream sequence at work. With relief washing over you in waves, you finally close out everything as dawn starts breaking through the window revealing the reality that once appeared so daunting under pressure but now feels achievable with its warmth and clarity.

You wake up from your dream feeling relieved yet invigorated by the experience of overcoming imaginary obstacles. Your professional life may have its pressures too; however, knowing how quickly they dissolve in the face of restorative sleep reassures you both professionally and personally.
