…you feel a storm approaching, and the air turns thick, electric, tasting faintly of metal. The birds vanish all at once, as if someone hit mute on the world. The trees, moments ago whispering gently, now lean in like conspirators, their branches creaking warnings in a language you almost understand.

A single drop of rain strikes your cheek—cold, deliberate, like a fingertip. Then another. Then the sky tears open.

But this is no ordinary storm.

The rain falls upward.

Silver threads of water rise from the moss and leaves, defying gravity, spiraling into a churning vortex of cloud that glows an unnatural violet. Lightning cracks sideways, forks of white fire stitching the air together in impossible geometries. With each flash you catch glimpses of things moving between the trunks—tall, antlered silhouettes made of shadow and starlight, watching you with eyes like dying galaxies.

Your heart should be pounding, but instead there’s a strange calm, the kind that comes right before you remember you can fly in dreams.

You spread your arms.

The upward rain catches you like a thousand cold hands lifting you off the forest floor. Leaves and petals whirl around you in a slow, deliberate tornado. As you rise above the treetops, the storm forms a perfect circle around you—a hurricane’s eye made of silence and violet light. In its center floats a single object: an old-fashioned pocket watch, ticking backward, its face cracked but still reflecting your own wide, wondering eyes.

You reach for it.

The moment your fingers close around the watch, the storm stops mid-breath. Raindrops hang frozen in the air like strings of diamonds. The shadow-figures in the forest bow their antlered heads. And the watch whispers, in a voice that sounds exactly like yours but older, sadder, wiser:

“You’re late for the waking world.”

Then it shatters.

You fall—not down, but forward—through the watchface like it’s a mirror, through layers of sleep and memory and half-remembered childhood summers, until you land softly…

…in your bed, eyes snapping open, heart finally racing now.

On your pillow lies a single violet petal, still wet with upward rain.

And somewhere in the dark, a clock you don’t own ticks backward, counting down to the next dream.
