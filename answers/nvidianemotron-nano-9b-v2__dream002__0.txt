The sky splits open with a cacophony of colors—violet lightning crackles above, and the air hums with an energy that isn’t quite natural. The trees around you shudder, their leaves glowing faintly as if lit from within. A low, resonant hum fills the forest, and the ground beneath your feet begins to pulse, as though the earth itself is breathing.  

Suddenly, a path materializes in the clearing, its surface shimmering with silver light. It wasn’t there before. You hesitate, but the storm seems to *call* to you, its intensity growing. As you step onto the path, the air shifts, and you hear a voice—soft, ancient, and layered with countless echoes. *“The storm is not a threat… it is a key.”*  

The trees part, revealing a hidden grove where a tree stands alone, its trunk twisted into a spiral. At its base, a door made of roots and bioluminescent moss awaits. When you touch it, the storm seems to pause, and the forest falls silent. The door creaks open, revealing a world beyond—one where the storm’s chaos is a bridge, not a barrier.  

What happens next? Do you step through, or does the dream twist again?
