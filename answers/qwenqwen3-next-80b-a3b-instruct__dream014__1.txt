You follow them through winding alleyways painted with murals that shift as you pass—faces whispering secrets, skies blooming into constellations only you seem to see. They don’t speak much, but their presence is warm, like a blanket woven from twilight and quiet laughter. One hands you a small compass that doesn’t point north, but *home*—a home you didn’t realize you were searching for.

At a bridge made of glowing paper lanterns, they pause, and one—a woman with eyes like smoky amber—smiles and says, *“You were never lost. You were remembering.”*

Then they vanish, one by one, dissolving into the scent of jasmine and rain-soaked pavement.

You stand alone again—but now the city doesn’t feel foreign. The neon signs spell out your childhood nickname. The music drifting from a café window is the lullaby your grandmother sang. A cat with too many eyes rubs against your leg and purrs, *“You’re here now.”*

And suddenly—you know.

This isn’t a place you found.

It’s a place that found you.

You take a deep breath.

And you begin to hum.

The city hums back.

You are not lost.

You are welcome.

And then—you wake up.

With the faint scent of jasmine still clinging to your skin.

And your heart, for the first time in years, feels full.
