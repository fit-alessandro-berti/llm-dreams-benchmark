Ah, the dream unfolds like liquid light—

The blank canvas before you isn’t empty at all. It *breathes*. The edges ripple like water touched by wind, and the surface shifts between matte and glossy, as if deciding whether to reflect the sky or absorb it. You reach out, and your fingers pass through the canvas like mist, but when you pull them back, they’re stained with colors that weren’t there before—swirling indigos, molten golds, a pulse of crimson that hums against your skin.

Then, the canvas *speaks*. Not in words, but in shapes. A circle detaches from its surface and floats toward you, flattening into a doorway. Beyond it, the landscape bends: trees grow upside-down, their roots tangled in the clouds, and the ground beneath you becomes a checkerboard of living tiles that rearrange themselves with every step. One square turns into a mirror, and for a heartbeat, you see your reflection—but your eyes are galaxies, and your mouth is a bridge between two distant stars.

A voice (or is it the wind?) whispers: *"Paint the silence."*

You look down. Your hands are now brushes, bristles made of starlight. The canvas stretches wider, hungry. You dip into the air itself, and the colors you pull from it are *alive*—a violet that tastes like thunder, a green that smells like rain on hot stone. The first stroke you make doesn’t land on the canvas. It *unfolds* into a river, rushing away from you, carving a canyon through the shifting earth. The second stroke becomes a flock of birds, their wings made of stained glass, scattering into the sky.

But then—

The canvas *resists*. A jagged tear appears in its center, and from the rip crawls a creature made of all the colors you didn’t use: the ones you feared, the ones that hurt to look at. It has no face, only a mouth full of teeth like shattered prisms, and it *hisses* in a language of fractals. The dream trembles. The trees invert again. The river you painted begins to boil.

You realize: the canvas isn’t asking you to create. It’s asking you to *choose*.

Do you—
- **Step through the doorway** (the circle still hovers nearby, now pulsing like a heartbeat), even though you don’t know where it leads?
- **Paint over the tear** with the colors you’ve gathered, sealing the creature inside the canvas forever?
- **Let the creature speak**, even if its voice unravels the dream around you?
- **Wake up**, before the choice is made for you?

The colors dim. The shapes hold their breath. The canvas waits.
