…wake up in a cold sweat because in the dream I’m not even human anymore.

I’m standing there in the open-plan office, fluorescent lights humming like angry bees, and my boss—tall, faceless, wearing the same navy suit he always does—is pointing at a screen the size of a billboard. The deadline reads: **00:00:01**. One second from now. The project? “Reverse-engineer the meaning of life, compile it into a single meme, and make it go viral before the clock hits zero.”

Everyone else in the office has frozen mid-step, like NPCs in a glitched game. Coffee cups hang in mid-air. A guy in accounting is eternally suspended mid-sneeze.

My boss leans in, his tie morphing into a countdown timer ticking down milliseconds. He whispers, but it echoes like a stadium PA: “You know what happens if you fail, right?”

I don’t know. I’ve never failed in this dream before.

My hands move without me. I open the laptop. The keyboard is made of wet spaghetti. Every key I press squelches. I type anyway. Words appear on the screen in Comic Sans: **THE MEANING OF LIFE IS…**

The timer on my boss’s tie hits 00:00:00.

The office explodes into confetti made of unpaid invoices.

My boss starts clapping slowly. His face is suddenly Elon Musk’s, then Taylor Swift’s, then my mom’s, cycling faster and faster. “You did it,” he/she/they say(s). “You stalled perfectly. That was the real project. Procrastination is the meaning of life.”

I look down. My hands are now tiny raccoon paws holding a half-eaten burrito.

I wake up holding my pillow like it owes me money.

The clock reads 3:14 AM.

I have a meeting in four hours.

Sweet dreams. 😈
