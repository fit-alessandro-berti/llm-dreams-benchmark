You dive for cover behind a large oak tree, the thunder roars overhead, and the rain begins to pour down in sheets. The wind howls as it whips the trees around you, and the branches creak and sway like they're protesting the storm. You huddle down, trying to shield your head and body from the relentless onslaught.

As suddenly as it began, the storm starts to abate, and the rain begins to slow. The wind dies down, and you emerge from your hiding spot, only to find that the once peaceful forest is now transformed. The trees stand tall and proud, their leaves shimmering with a strange, ethereal light. The air is filled with an otherworldly fragrance, and the atmosphere is charged with an energy that seems to hum around you.

You notice a small, glowing figure standing at the edge of a clearing. As you approach, you realize it's a young girl, no more than ten years old, with hair as dark as the night sky and eyes that dance with stars. She smiles at you, beckoning you to follow her.

Do you:

A) Follow the girl into the clearing?
B) Stay where you are, trying to figure out what's happening?
C) Call out to the girl, asking if she's okay?
