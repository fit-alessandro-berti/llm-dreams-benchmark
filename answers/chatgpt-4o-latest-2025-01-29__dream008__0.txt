feel a surge of panic. As you reach for your computer, the keyboard melts like warm butter under your fingers. The letters swirl into unreadable symbols, and the screen flickers with cryptic equations that seem to rewrite themselves.

Your boss, now strangely taller and with glowing eyes, taps their watch impatiently. "Time is running out," they say, their voice echoing in an unnatural way.

You glance around, but your workplace has transformed—the walls stretch infinitely, lined with towering filing cabinets that open and close on their own. Papers flutter like trapped birds, and the fluorescent lights overhead begin to flicker wildly.

Desperate, you grab a pen, but it turns into a wriggling snake, slithering up your arm. You try to shake it off, but suddenly, you realize the floor beneath you is no longer solid—you're sinking into a sea of unread emails.

Then, just as you feel yourself being pulled under, a door appears in the distance. It's glowing with an eerie blue light. Instinct tells you that if you reach it, you might escape… 

Do you run for it?
