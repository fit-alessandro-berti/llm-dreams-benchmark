You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and feel a strange mix of curiosity and unease tugging at you. The room is a swirl of laughter, clinking glasses, and overlapping conversations, all lit by the warm glow of chandeliers that seem to flicker like stars. You weave through the crowd, catching snippets of chatter—someone’s debating the meaning of life, another group is laughing over a story about a runaway cat. 
Suddenly, you spot your friend across the room, their familiar face a beacon in the sea of strangers. But as you start toward them, the floor beneath you shifts, soft and rippling like water. The crowd doesn’t seem to notice, their voices growing distant as the room stretches and bends. You glance down to see your shoes sinking into a shimmering, silvery liquid that’s now pooling around your ankles. Panic flickers, but then you hear your friend’s voice calling your name, clear as a bell despite the chaos.
Looking up, you see they’re closer now, standing on what looks like solid ground—a small island of normalcy amid the dreamlike flood. You wade toward them, the liquid cool against your skin, and as you reach out, they grab your hand. The moment you touch, the room snaps back into focus: the floor is solid tile again, the chandeliers steady, the crowd buzzing as if nothing happened. Your friend grins and says, “You always find me, don’t you?” 
But before you can answer, a figure in a long, iridescent coat brushes past, whispering, “The party’s just beginning.” You turn to follow their gaze, and the walls of the room dissolve into a sprawling, starlit forest. The guests transform—some sprout wings, others shimmer into shadows—and your friend tugs you forward, laughing, “Come on, let’s see where this goes!” The dream sweeps you along, a wild, wondrous current you can’t resist.
