feel a surge of panic. The clock on the wall seems to tick louder with every second, amplifying your anxiety. You sit at your desk, staring at the blank screen, your mind racing to find a way to tackle the project. 

Suddenly, the office transforms around you—the walls melt away, and you find yourself in a vast library filled with endless books and glowing manuscripts. Each book contains the exact knowledge and skills you need to complete the project. You reach out and pull a book off the shelf, feeling a calm confidence wash over you.

As you begin to read, ideas flow effortlessly, and solutions seem to write themselves. Time bends and stretches, giving you more hours than you thought possible. Glancing up, you see your boss smiling, impressed and relieved. You finish the project just in time, feeling triumphant and capable.

Then, the library fades away, and you wake up, feeling motivated and ready to face your real challenges.
