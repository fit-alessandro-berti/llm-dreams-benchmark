…adapt quickly if you want to survive. You’re standing on the edge of a sprawling, sunlit market square, the air rich with the scent of baked bread, dried herbs, and wood smoke. Cloaked figures barter over bolts of cloth, earthenware pots, and baskets of gleaming fruit. The buildings are made of timber and stone, their upper floors jutting over cobblestone streets. Somewhere behind you, a blacksmith’s hammer rings out in slow, rhythmic strikes.

Panic flickers in your chest—your phone, your watch, even your clothes mark you as strange and out of place. You pat your pockets instinctively, but there’s not a single modern item left on you. Somehow, your jeans and T-shirt have been replaced by rough wool garments and worn leather boots.

If you’re going to blend in, you’ll need to **understand the local customs**, **find shelter**, and **secure food or some form of currency**. A group of children suddenly runs past you, laughing, but one stops mid-stride to stare—tilting his head before scampering toward a narrow alley that disappears between two tall, leaning buildings.

You feel the weight of a decision pressing in on you:  
Do you…  

1. Follow the child into the alley, hoping they might lead you to someone who can help?  
2. Stay in the market, trying to barter with what little you have to gather information?  
3. Slip away toward the outskirts of town to observe from a safer distance?  

Which will it be?
