I’m reaching for the blank canvas, and even before I touch it, the sky folds like origami around my arm. Colors spill across my skin: a bruise of blue, a soap-bubble shimmer, a cough of saffron. The ground is a flock of polygons that stutter and resettle, a mountain of rings climbing toward a door made of graph paper, which blinks whenever I look too directly at it.

The canvas is a square of silence perched on an easel built from old light and the spines of seashells. Its edges hum without a sound. The air smells faintly of wet stone and battery warmth. A pencil lay there, but it isn’t a pencil; it’s a bird—black, endless, lighter than the idea of ink. When I brush my thumb along its tail, it turns blue at the tip, and the blue knows my name.

I draw a dot.

The dot grows. From it, a city of mouths opens in the direction I did not intend. Each mouth is a vowel. I press again and draw a spiral. It grows a staircase that leads sideways into the mint-green field that has always been the hour between dusk and the next dusk. Triangles sprout from the spiral like thorns, and from their points, small houses open and close like lungs.

Every line I add sets the landscape right again and wronger than before. A rectangle becomes a door; I open it and step into a room that is only the idea of a rug. Outside, the horizon has always been sky, but now it is made of paper; it keeps folding back and forth, revealing weather that is a thought no one else is having. A square I meant to be a mirror refuses to be honest and turns into a lake, a perfect dark that refuses to hold my reflection and refuses to let me leave.

I keep drawing. I make a triangle of ash and it refuses to burn. I make a circle of sand and it hums a scale in the key of listening. The sky scrunches into a ribbon and wraps itself around the farthest hillside. Wind has moved to become a character and wanders into the frame, its hair like torn letters, asking if I am painting the world or borrowing it.

The pencil-bird tastes my restlessness and sprouts a second wing, a second breath. I draw with the second breath, and I have a new color: the color of questions asked in another language, the color that means sorry and hello at once. I write a small word, almost a punctuation mark, at the top right. It warms and starts to glow; it opens a door that doesn’t need a hand. On the other side, a wind that is a language arrives, and every shape around us loses its edges to become rhythm.

There’s a thin thread of light that looks like it could belong to a different map, a different geography. I tie it to the corner of the canvas and let it unravel across the floor. It becomes a river. The river says, in a way only water can, if I keep going, I will meet myself again. I nod, because I am already not sure what staying would mean here.

I don’t know yet what I am painting. A door that opens both ways. A room inside a word. A season that remembers you. The canvas watches me the way shadows watch from under trees when the day gets shy.

And then the world waits, very politely, for what I will add next.
