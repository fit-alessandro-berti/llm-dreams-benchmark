...delicate etchings that seem to shift ever so slightly when you’re not looking directly at them. The metal is warm under your fingertips, as though it were alive, and the patterns begin to align into something resembling a map—though it is not of any place you have ever known.  

The box hums faintly, a sound felt more in your chest than in your ears, and from somewhere far away—or perhaps from inside your own thoughts—you hear a voice whisper, “It will open when you understand.”  

A sudden gust of wind swirls around you, carrying the faint scent of rain and something older, something earthly and foreign at once. The symbols rearrange themselves again, forming what looks like an eye, and the soft hum becomes a rhythmic pulse. Your surroundings flicker—one moment you are standing in a sunlit meadow, the next in an endless midnight corridor lined with mirrors reflecting not your body, but different versions of you.  

You sense the box growing heavier in your hands, as if it has absorbed part of you. One of the mirrors shows your reflection smiling knowingly and reaching forward, pressing its hand to the glass.  

The box’s latch loosens.  

Do you want me to continue the dream down a **mystical revelation path** or down an **unsettling horror path**?
