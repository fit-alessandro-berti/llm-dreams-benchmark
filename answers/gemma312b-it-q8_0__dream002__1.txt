You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. you feel a storm approaching and **a strange, echoing pulse thrumming through the earth. Above the sighing of the ancient cedar, you notice a darkening not of ordinary clouds, but a shimmering, shifting grey like disturbed mercury. The trees grow unnervously tall and gaunt. 

Suddenly, rain begins to fall – no soft patter, but heavy, oily droplets that land with a surprisingly warm feel. The air tastes metallic. The path dissolves beneath my feet; it feels like walking on a shifting, mossy substance. As I stumble forward looking for shelter, flashes of purple electric light split the unnatural grey, revealing glimpses of...buildings? No. Constructions unlike any real architecture. Geometric, impossibly scaled, crafted from what looked like woven bone. They hovered amongst the trees, half-hidden in the tempest's gloom.**

A melodic but undeniably mournful song begins to weave out from somewhere unseen. It's not sung by *living* voices – too perfectly harmonious, with far too many layers echoing and blending. I feel a pull toward the sounds, a compulsion to discover from whence they originate from.  Hesitantly, I venture toward the glow.

As I move deeper, the warmth intensifies and I see shapes starting solidifying within the storm - colossal silhouettes that resemble creatures, but twisted, fragmented, like pieces from different realities stitched together haphazardly.  A vast wing – metallic scaled – blinks into sight. Then disappears. All is happening so fast. 

I raise my arms as if trying to hold back the storm but can manage only to see another building, glowing with an otherworldly cyan light. On a higher part of the construction I see someone...or something. A vaguely humanoid form made of smoke and star-stuff, standing utterly motionless. As they observe me, a single emotion floods my being - immense curiosity, mixed with a profound sense of unwelcome. I know, somehow, I shouldn’t be there.**

Right before it turns closer I snap to a cold sweat. It’s silent except of the rhythm of my pulse. Am I awake?




**(My dream abruptly ends here, dissolving back into dark nothingness.)**
