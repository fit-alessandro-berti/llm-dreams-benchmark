navigate your way through the labyrinthine streets of the city, hoping to stumble upon some clue to your destination. The buildings around you are impossibly tall, their glass facades reflecting a sky painted in hues you've never seen before—soft oranges that bleed into deep, shimmering blues. People rush past you, their faces blurred and voices muffled, as if the city itself is keeping secrets. 

You check your watch—it looks strange, with shifting hands that don't seem to obey the laws of time. You try to remember who the meeting is with or what it's about, but the details slip through your grasp like sand through fingers. A deep sense of urgency presses against your chest, and you begin to run.

Inside, the walls are lined with clock faces, each one showing a different time. At the base of the tower is a long table set for a meeting, but there's no one seated there yet. An empty chair sits at the head of the table, with a nameplate that reads *Your Name.*

You sit down, and just as you do, the clocks begin to chime in unison. A door you hadn't noticed creaks open, and figures begin to enter, their faces half-hidden by light. They each greet you warmly, yet you can't quite recall who they are. As the meeting begins, you suddenly understand that...
