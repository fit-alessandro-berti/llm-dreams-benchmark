**Dream Continuation:**  

You wake in a sun-drenched field, the air thick with the scent of earth and smoke. Cobblestone paths wind through thatched-roof huts, and villagers in coarse linen clothes eye you warily. A glance at your hands—calloused and dirt-streaked—confirms this is no simulation. Panic rises as you fumble for a phone that isn’t there.  

As you wander, a town crier’s voice booms: *“The comet approaches! Three days hence, it shall darken the sky!”* The crowd murmurs in fear, but your blood runs colder. You remember this event from history—a celestial spectacle once blamed for a plague that wiped out half the region. Only now, you realize the truth: the “plague” was caused by contaminated well water, panic-driven chaos, and a lack of basic sanitation.  

**You need to convince the villagers to prepare.** But how? Without germ theory or modern medicine, your words sound like madness. The local healer accuses you of heresy; the blacksmith scoffs at your plea to boil water. Desperate, you spot the manor of the reclusive alchemist—a man history remembers as a fool, but whose notes, you recall, hinted at rudimentary chemistry.  

Time is short. You barter your wristwatch (still ticking, a tiny marvel here) for parchment and ink. Sketching diagrams of aqueducts and filters, you blend half-remembered science with the alchemist’s cryptic symbols. If you can’t save them with truth, maybe you can save them with myth.  

The comet looms. The villagers gather, torn between fear and curiosity. You raise your makeshift scrolls, praying your borrowed authority holds. *“The stars demand purity,”* you declare, voice steady. *“Build this, and the curse shall pass.”*  

They hesitate. Then the first hammer strikes stone.

**Twist:** The real test comes at dawn, when a stranger arrives—wearing a frayed NASA jacket. *“You altered the timeline,”* they whisper. *“Now fix it. Or stay trapped here forever.”*
