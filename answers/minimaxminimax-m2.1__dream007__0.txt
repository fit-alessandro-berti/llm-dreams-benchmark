# The Argument

You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to pause, taking a step back to catch your breath. In that moment of silence, you notice something strange—the room around you begins to shift, the walls becoming translucent, revealing glimpses of memories playing out like film reels.

You see the two of you as children, building sandcastles on a beach, your laughter echoing through the vision. Then you're teenagers, staying up all night discussing dreams that seemed impossible back then. The argument suddenly feels smaller against the weight of all these years.

Your friend notices the visions too, and their face softens. "Why does everything have to be so complicated now?" they ask, their voice cracking slightly.

You realize the argument isn't really about what you thought it was. It's about fear—fear of changing, of growing apart, of the unknown. The dreams you once shared have taken different paths, and you're both terrified that those diverging roads mean the end of something sacred.

You reach out and touch their shoulder, the way you used to when you were twelve and the world felt too big. "I don't want to win this," you say quietly. "I just want us to still be us."

The visions solidify back into the room, but something has shifted. The argument dissolves not because one of you was wrong, but because you both remembered what matters more than being right.

You wake up with a phone in your hand, ready to call them—not to apologize, but just to hear their voice.
