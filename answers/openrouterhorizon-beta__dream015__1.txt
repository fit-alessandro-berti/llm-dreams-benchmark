…keep a journal. Not of rations or routes or the names of those you’ve lost, though those matter, too. You decide to chronicle every small evidence of wonder left in the world, to prove to yourself that wonder still exists.

Day 1: You salvage a sun-bleached notebook from a toppled kiosk, its pages stubborn and crisp. You sit beneath the ribcage of an overpass and write that the wind smells like rain and rust, and that you saw a dandelion forcing its way through a crack in the asphalt, a yellow coin in a bankrupt city. You write that your hands are shaking from hunger but steady when you press the pencil to paper.

Day 4: A stray dog with two different colored eyes follows you for an hour, then pretends it meant to be there all along. You share a shard of jerky, half for the dog, half for the idea of companionship. You name the dog Echo because it returns the sound of your voice with a tilt of its head. That night, Echo curls against your side, ribs rising and falling, and you dream of a field of wheat bending like a choir.

Day 9: You barter three batteries for a bundle of seeds. The woman who trades them wears a necklace of keys that open nothing anymore. She tells you to plant when the ground feels warm like a sleeping child’s forehead. You hold the seeds in your palm and feel the future whisper through your skin. Echo sneezes at the smell of earth you’re already imagining.

Day 12: Storm. The sky boils, and the city exhales glass and bone. You and Echo take shelter in a museum, its exhibits scrimmed with dust. In the pale of your flashlight, you see animals in poses of old grace: a heron mid-step, a fox with its mouth open on a silent bark. You fall asleep beneath a dinosaur’s sternum, and the rain plays xylophone on the skylight.

Day 17: You find a rooftop with soil tangled in tar and dead leaves. There’s a rusted bathtub up there, stained by forgotten summers. You pull weeds the way you once pulled hair from a brush—patiently, a little sad. You thumb the seeds into shallow graves and whisper their names like it might mean something: bean, kale, basil. You pour into them the last water you can spare without being foolish. You feel foolish anyway, but also brave.

Day 23: A flare in the distance like a flicked cigarette. You wait it out. There are stories about lights that lead you to scavengers who will take more than you can afford. Echo growls low, a sound like a door dragging closed. The moon is bitten into a thin smile. You write that you crave a taste you can’t name and realize it is safety.

Day 29: Sprouts. Not much, just green punctuation rising from the rooftop earth. You and Echo sit in silence, making a ritual of it. You press your fingers to the leaves and they are cool and damp, like morning. Suddenly, the city does not seem like a cemetery but like a library someone left open.

Day 33: You meet a man on the stairwell with the careful hands of a clockmaker. He carries a jar of lightning bugs he calls his lantern. He asks if you’ve seen the river. You say no. He describes it as a creature that forgot how to sing but hasn’t given up moving. He trades you a spool of fishing line for a handful of hope, which is to say he takes nothing and leaves you a spool of fishing line. Echo sniffs his boots and approves.

Day 40: You and the man—whose name is Lark, because his parents had sense of humor—walk to the river. It is a scar through the city. The banks are stitched with willow roots and plastic bags. The water carries a slow film of yesterday, but beneath it there are flashes of silver, quick as secrets. You and Lark stand with lines in your hands and the sun warming your shoulders, and for an hour you are citizens of an older world in which patience is a currency, which you happen to have.

Day 52: The basil heightens the taste of everything you have left. Echo steals a leaf and sneezes three times, offended by his own audacity. Lark plays a tune on a flute made from a piece of conduit. It’s not music, not quite, but it is a net cast across the silence and drawn in brimming with feeling.

Day 60: A new danger: smoke on the horizon, coming fast. People move like birds startled up from grain—some in flurries, some in purposeful vees. You pack what you can: seeds, notebook, line, a chipped mug that says Mornings Are Magic, which you keep even though mornings are always the hardest. Echo waits at the door, understanding that going matters more than staying.

Day 61: The fire never appears, as if it changed its mind or found some other feast. You make camp beside a collapsed greenhouse where vines have made a cathedral. The air smells of tomato ghosts. You press your ear to the earth like a doctor, listening for a heartbeat, and somewhere, far away, you think you hear one.

Day 73: A girl with a pink ribbon tied to her belt loop shows you how to catch dew in a plastic sheet you stretch like a small sky between poles. She laughs like wind chimes. She says her name is Mina and that she is traveling west, because someone told her the word ocean and she wants to see if it’s big enough to swallow the ache in her chest. You trade her a story about the dandelion and she trades you a map with all the edges worn off.

Day 89: The journal is heavier now. Not with ink, but with the feeling that each word is a seed. You write that today you taught Echo to high-five and then cried because it meant you believed in a future where party tricks might matter. You write that your hands do not shake as much when you think about the river or the basil or the high-five. You write that maybe this is what survival really is: the stacking of small mercies until you can climb them to look for the horizon.

Day 97: The three of you—because when did you become three?—reach a hill where the grass has made a soft rebellion against ruin. The city is a chessboard missing too many pieces to play, but the wind runs its fingers through the grass and hums an endgame anyway. Lark says, “We could stop here.” Mina says, “We should keep going.” Echo rolls onto his back to scratch an itch and solves nothing.

Day 100: You plant again. Not just the seeds, but a flag of intention: a shirt on a pole that means Home. You tie Mina’s pink ribbon to the top so it will sing. You and Lark rig gutters from old pipes to catch rain. You cut your hand and bleed a little into the soil and choose to believe that this is a pact. Echo patrols the perimeter like a knight, occasional and valiant.

Night 102: You dream of the ocean, not as a destination but as a sound: endless, kind, big enough to take your ache and polish it into something smooth. You wake with the moon on your face and the ribbon whispering overhead like a reminder that even the smallest wind deserves a song.

Later, when someone asks you how you made it, you won’t talk about the traps or the routes or the nights you slept on rooftops counting the stars like debts. You will say: I decided to keep a ledger of miracles. I decided to share water with a dog and plant basil on a roof and go to the river with a stranger and learn the shape of the word ocean from a girl with a ribbon. I decided to live as if what I loved could be tended. And then I tended it, and it loved me back.

In the dream, this is enough. And when you wake, you taste basil on your tongue and feel Echo’s weight by your feet and the world hasn’t ended yet. You decide, again, to begin.
