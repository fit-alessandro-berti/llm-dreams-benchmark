...written in a language you don't recognize.  Panic surges through you. It looks like a mix of hieroglyphics and Wingdings, with the occasional emoji thrown in for good measure.  The other students around you seem unfazed, scribbling away furiously on their answer sheets. You glance at the clock – time is ticking away relentlessly.  

Your heart hammers in your chest. You try to decipher even a single word, a single symbol, but it's all gibberish.  Suddenly, the proctor, a tall figure with a hawk's head and a tweed suit,  materializes beside you. He leans in, his beak inches from your ear, and whispers, "The answers are not on the paper. They are within you." Then he vanishes in a puff of smoke that smells faintly of cinnamon. 

Confused and desperate, you close your eyes and take a deep breath. You think back to all the lessons you've learned, not just in this course, but throughout your life.  Images flash through your mind: building a treehouse as a child, comforting a friend in need, the thrill of solving a complex puzzle.  As you delve deeper into your memories, the strange symbols on the exam paper begin to shift and morph. Slowly, they start to resemble familiar objects and concepts – a hammer representing resourcefulness, a bridge symbolizing connection, a key unlocking potential. 

You realize the hawk-headed proctor was right. This exam isn't about rote memorization, it's about understanding who you are and what you're capable of. With newfound confidence, you pick up your pen and begin to answer the questions, not with words, but with drawings and symbols that represent your unique journey and the lessons you've learned along the way.  The fear is gone, replaced by a sense of purpose and excitement for the future, whatever it may hold.
