Okay, I'm dreaming... let's see where this goes.

You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to **panic, a little. It's a subtle panic, the kind that prickles under your skin, making your palms slightly damp. The city pulses around you - a cacophony of strange languages, whirring vehicles that look like giant beetles, and buildings that stretch into the sky like crystallized trees. There are no familiar landmarks, no street signs I can recognize. I reach into my pocket, hoping for a crumpled appointment card or a phone, but find nothing. My pockets are as empty as my memory of how I got here.**

**The initial panic quickly morphs into a strange kind of determined focus. I take a deep breath, trying to anchor myself in the chaos. Okay, one hour. I can work with that, maybe. I decide to find the nearest person who might be able to understand me, even if we don't share a common tongue. I spot a figure selling what looks like glowing fruit from a small, ornate stall. They have kind, crinkled eyes and an aura of calm, so I approach them tentatively. I try to speak in a slow, deliberate English, hoping it translates to something understandable. “Excuse me,” I say, my voice coming out a little too high pitched, “I have… a very important… meeting. I don’t know where it is.”**

**I gesture wildly with my hands, miming a meeting, a formal sit-down, a sense of urgency. The fruit vendor smiles gently, their eyes crinkling further. They don’t respond in words I understand, but they nod knowingly and point with a long, slender finger towards a swirling vortex of light that seems to shimmer like heat off the pavement. It looks less like a street and more like a portal, and the apprehension washes back in a wave. Is this… right? Is this where I should go? The vendor offers me one of their glowing fruits, the light within it pulsing softly. I take it, the warmth a strange comfort. Maybe this isn’t so bad after all. I take a bite, and it tastes of sunshine and anticipation. I look back at the vendor, they give me another nod, then I decide to trust their guidance and, heart pounding a little more with each step, I head towards the shimmering portal.**

**As I get closer, the vortex seems to expand, pulling me in. I feel a strange sensation of floating, of being disassembled and reassembled. I close my eyes, and when I open them, I'm not on a street anymore. I am in a large, circular room made of a smooth, cool material. There are others there, too, some familiar, some not, all waiting with an expectant look. I feel a sense of calm, like I have arrived at the right place. The hour seems less important now, as a feeling of belonging settles over me. But, what is this meeting about? And why do I feel like I’ve been here before?**

**The dream lingers in the strange, serene calm of that circular room, leaving me with a sense of anticipation, a quiet curiosity about what will come next.**
