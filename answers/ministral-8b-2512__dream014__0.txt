In your dream, the kindness of the strangers feels like a breath of fresh air in the suffocating hum of the city. Their voices are warm, their gestures open—one person gestures toward a flickering neon sign that reads *"The Wayfaring Inn"* in a language you don’t recognize but *understand* in your bones. Another holds out a small, worn compass, its needle spinning wildly before settling on a direction that makes your chest ache with longing.

You hesitate. *"Why me?"* you ask, though your throat is tight.

The group exchanges glances, then the tallest one—a woman with ink-stained fingers and a smile like sunlight through rain—laughs. *"Because you’re looking,"* she says. *"Most people just walk. You’re standing still. That’s how you find the right path."*

They lead you through the labyrinth of alleys, where the city’s usual chaos dissolves into something softer—like stepping into a painting where the edges blur into gold. The compass glows faintly in your palm, and when you glance down, the needle points not to a street, but to *yourself*. A memory surfaces: a child’s voice, whispering, *"You don’t have to know the way. Just take the next step."*

At the inn’s door, the woman presses a key into your hand. *"It’s not a place,"* she murmurs. *"It’s a choice."* The key fits the lock of your own front door in a house you’ve never seen before, its walls lined with doors you’ve never dared open.

As you wake, the weight of loneliness lifts—just for a moment—but the key stays warm in your palm, and the city’s hum fades into the sound of your own heartbeat, steady and unhurried.

Would you like to explore another layer? Maybe the house, the key’s origin, or what happens when you *do* open that first door?
