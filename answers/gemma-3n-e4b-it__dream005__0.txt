You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and… a sudden wave of shimmering, iridescent bubbles drifts through the room. They aren’t just floating; they seem to be *searching*, gently bumping into shoulders and pausing as if examining faces. 

You instinctively duck behind a towering potted fern, its fronds brushing your face with a cool, damp sensation. Peeking out, you see a woman with hair like spun moonlight trying to catch a bubble. It bounces off her cheek, leaving a faint, glittering residue. She sighs dramatically. 

“Honestly,” she murmurs to a man in a velvet jacket and a monocle, “they’re getting so picky this year. Last year, it was all about the magenta ones. Now, only the cerulean will do.”

You try to approach them, but as you step forward, the bubbles shift and coalesce around a group of people playing a silent game of charades. The charade is… unsettling. One woman is flapping her arms wildly, clearly attempting to portray a flock of pigeons, but everyone else is staring at her with a deeply serious expression, as if the fate of the world hinges on her pigeon impersonation. 

You try to navigate through the crowd, but it’s like swimming through honey. Each person is a blur of faces, their conversations swirling around you – snippets of philosophical debates, hurried business transactions, and someone passionately describing the intricacies of competitive cheese sculpting. 

Then, a small, furry creature, resembling a squirrel but with butterfly wings, lands on your shoulder. It nuzzles your ear and whispers, “The answer lies in the clockwork bird.” Before you can ask what that means, it flits away, disappearing into the kaleidoscope of dancing bubbles and bewildered faces. 

You look around wildly, trying to spot anything that resembles a clockwork bird. The room seems to be tilting slightly. A jazz band starts playing a melody composed entirely of sighs. And you realize, with a growing sense of disorientation, that finding your friend is secondary now. You have a clockwork bird to find. And you're pretty sure the squirrels are involved.
