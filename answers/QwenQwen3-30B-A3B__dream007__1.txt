You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **reach into your pocket, pull out a small, weathered key, and hand it to them**. The key is warm, humming faintly, as if alive. Your friend freezes, their face flickering between confusion and recognition. 

Suddenly, the room around you dissolves into a vast, starry void. The air smells like ozone and forgotten memories. Your friend’s voice echoes, layered and distant: *“You always had the key. Why didn’t you use it?”* 

You realize, with a jolt, that the argument wasn’t about the thing you’d been fighting over—the *real* issue was something deeper, something you’d both buried. The key glows brighter, and the void shifts, revealing a door you’ve never seen before, its surface etched with your shared history. 

As you step toward it, the dream twists again. You’re no longer in the argument. You’re standing in a sunlit meadow, your friend beside you, smiling softly. The key slips from your hand and turns to dust, scattering like embers. You understand, in a way that feels both ancient and new: some conflicts aren’t meant to be won. They’re meant to be *unlocked*. 

And the door? It’s still there, waiting. Or maybe it was never closed.
