**Dream Continuation: *The Forgotten Valley***

---

You wake to the scent of damp earth and pine, your fingers brushing against rough wool as you sit up. The air is crisp, carrying the faint metallic tang of a forge and the distant lowing of cattle. You’re lying on a straw-stuffed pallet in a small, timber-framed hut, its walls woven with wattle and daub. A single oil lamp flickers on a wooden table, casting long shadows over a clay jug and a loaf of dark, dense bread.

Your clothes are unfamiliar—coarse linen tunic, leather belt, and woolen leggings tied with thongs. A dagger with a bone handle rests beside you, its blade dull but serviceable. You touch your face; your hair is longer, braided in a way you don’t recognize. *How long have I been here?*

Outside, the world is alive with sounds you’ve never heard before: the rhythmic *clink* of a blacksmith’s hammer, the creak of a water wheel, the chatter of a language that feels half-familiar, like a song you once knew the words to. You step into the doorway and squint against the golden light of a late afternoon sun.

The village sprawls before you—a cluster of thatched roofs and muddy paths, surrounded by a wooden palisade. Beyond it, rolling hills stretch toward a dense forest, its trees gnarled and ancient. A river cuts through the valley, its banks lined with women washing clothes, their laughter bright against the murmur of the water. Children chase each other near a pen of grunting pigs, while men in leather jerkins sharpen spears or mend nets.

A woman with a basket of herbs on her hip notices you and frowns. She says something in that strange tongue, but you catch the tone: *Who are you? What are you doing here?* You open your mouth, but no words come. Panic flutters in your chest—you don’t know the language, you don’t know the rules, you don’t even know *when* you are.

Then, a hand claps your shoulder. You turn to see a broad-shouldered man with a beard braided with iron rings. His eyes are sharp, assessing. He speaks slowly, as if testing you, and this time, you understand a few words: *"Stranger… lost… danger…"* He points toward the forest, where the trees seem to darken unnaturally, as if something watches from their depths.

The woman with the herbs shakes her head, muttering what sounds like a warning. The man ignores her, gripping your arm. *"Come,"* he says, or at least that’s what you think he means. *"Before the sun sets."*

You have no choice but to follow.

### **What Do You Do?**
1. **Trust the man.** He seems to know the dangers of this place, and you need guidance. But what does he want in return?
2. **Ask the woman for help.** She might know more about the forest—or about *you*. But she clearly doesn’t trust you.
3. **Sneak away on your own.** The village feels unsafe, and the forest might hold answers. But what lurks in those shadows?
4. **Search the hut for clues.** Maybe there’s something here that explains how you arrived—or how to leave.
5. **Something else.** (Describe your action.)

**Themes to Explore (if you’d like):**
- **The Language Barrier:** Do you start to understand the tongue, or is there a magical explanation for your sudden comprehension?
- **The Forest’s Secret:** Is it a place of spirits, a hiding spot for outlaws, or something far older?
- **Your Past in This World:** Do the villagers recognize you? Are you someone important—or someone cursed?
- **The Man’s Motives:** Is he a protector, a slave trader, or a man who sees an opportunity in a lost stranger?
