You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and… the air grows heavy, thick with the scent of ozone and damp earth. Dark clouds churn overhead, swallowing the sunlight, and the trees shudder as if awakening from a long slumber. A low rumble echoes through the canopy, and then—**the sky splits open**.  

Lightning cracks the horizon, illuminating a path of swirling silver mist that snakes toward you. The wind howls, carrying whispers that aren’t quite words: *“Follow. Choose. Remember.”* Rain lashes your face, but instead of pain, it feels like liquid memory—fragments of moments you’ve forgotten, of places you’ve never been. The forest around you shifts, trees bending into archways, roots curling into staircases that vanish into the storm.  

You step forward, and the mist parts to reveal a glade bathed in bioluminescent light. At its center stands a mirror-like pool, reflecting not your face, but a version of yourself—older, wiser, holding a key made of starlight. The storm’s voice grows clearer: *“What do you seek?”*  

You reach for the key, and the world dissolves into a cascade of color…  

*(What happens next?)* 🌩️
