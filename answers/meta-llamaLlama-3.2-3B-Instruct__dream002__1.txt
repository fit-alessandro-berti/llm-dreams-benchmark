...the sky grows dark and the air is filled with an electric charge. The trees, which had been swaying gently in the breeze just moments before, now creak and groan as the wind picks up. The leaves rustle and whirl around me, creating a miniature tornado that threatens to lift me off the ground.

As the storm draws closer, the air is filled with the scent of ozone and the sound of thunder rumbles in the distance. I can feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end as the wind howls and the trees seem to reach out to me like skeletal fingers.

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning illuminates the sky, casting an eerie glow over the forest. I feel a jolt of fear as I realize I'm not alone. A figure stands before me, tall and imposing, its features shrouded in mist.

The figure raises a hand, and I feel a strange sensation, as if I'm being pulled towards it. The air is filled with a buzzing noise, and I feel my body begin to tingle and prickle. The figure's hand reaches out, and I feel a sudden surge of energy as our fingers touch.

As I look up at the figure, I see that it's a woman with long, flowing hair and eyes that seem to see right through me. Her face is etched with a look of sadness and longing, and I feel a deep sense of connection to her.

"Come with me," she says, her voice barely above a whisper. "We must escape this storm."

I feel a thrill of excitement mixed with fear as I follow her into the heart of the forest. The trees seem to close in around us, and the wind howls with a fierce intensity. But I'm not afraid, because I know that I'm not alone. The woman's hand is holding mine, and together we're ready to face whatever the storm has in store for us.
