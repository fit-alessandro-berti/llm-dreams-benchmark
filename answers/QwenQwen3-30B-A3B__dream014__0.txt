You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you follow them through a maze of neon-lit alleys where the air hums with the buzz of unseen machinery. Their faces are soft, blurred at the edges like reflections in a rippling pond, and they speak in a language that feels both foreign and familiar, as if the words are stitching themselves into your bones.  

They lead you to a towering structure made of glass and smoke, its surface shifting between a library, a clockwork cathedral, and a forest of crystalline trees. A woman with a crown of feathers hands you a key that glows faintly, whispering, *“The city remembers you.”* As you turn the key in an invisible lock, the world around you dissolves into a cascade of colors and sounds—a symphony of footsteps, laughter, and the distant cry of a bird.  

You wake up in a field under a sky stitched with constellations you’ve never seen, the scent of rain and forgotten memories clinging to the air. The city is gone, but in your hand, you hold a single feather, warm and pulsing like a heartbeat. You don’t know where you’re going, but for the first time, you feel the map inside you, glowing faintly, waiting to be read.
