…composed of strange, shifting symbols that refuse to stay still. Each line of text blurs and reforms, sometimes appearing as dense paragraphs in a language you don’t recognize, other times collapsing into geometric shapes that hover just above the page. You try to read the first question, but it dissolves into a swirl of ink before your eyes, then reassembles itself into a Rorschach-like blot that seems to pulse in time with your heartbeat.

Your classmates around you are writing furiously, quills scratching against parchment, mechanical pencils scraping at laminated paper, charcoal smudging onto vellum. Except, these classmates aren’t entirely recognizable. Though you sit in a familiar lecture hall, the rows are filled with figures that blend human and animal features: a tall, antlered person in a graduate’s gown scribbles something on a stone tablet; a creature with fur-tufted ears and long fingers flips through a never-ending exam booklet; a silent figure wearing a mask shaped like a hummingbird’s head runs a fountain pen down a papyrus scroll. Each seems perfectly at ease, as if they have studied for this for years, as if they understand these questions you cannot even read.

You feel panic clutch at your chest. This exam will determine everything—your future career, your home, your place in a society you barely recall. You try to recall the subject of the exam, but your memory won’t cooperate. Instead, a sense of urgency drives you to pick up your pen and attempt an answer. The pen, however, won’t write in straight lines. Your words slant upward, dance across the margins, the ink turning from deep black to shimmering silver with every letter you press into the page.

Just then, the professor glides silently down the aisle. At first, you think it’s your old teacher, a stern figure who once lectured you about logic and structure. But as the professor passes under a beam of light, their face warps: one moment it’s an elegant visage with kind eyes, the next, a bright mask with interlocking puzzle pieces where a mouth should be. They place a hand on your shoulder and whisper something, but the words drift off into the quiet hum of the fluorescent lights overhead. You’re left only with the sensation that you must decode the inkblots on your exam sheet before the bell rings.

Taking a deep breath, you refocus on the page. This time, you don’t try to read it like normal text. Instead, you let your gaze soften and see the patterns within the shapes. Slowly, you begin to understand: each swirl and figure corresponds to a memory, each memory to a concept you once knew. Your childhood voice reciting multiplication tables. The smell of old textbooks in a library. The sound of chalk clacking gently on a blackboard. The warmth of understanding as a once-confusing theorem suddenly made sense. You realize that to answer these questions, you must draw upon what you already carry inside you, not what is written.

As you guide your pen across the shifting patterns, something within you clarifies. Your answers begin to take shape in gentle, fluid lines. The ink no longer rebels; it cooperates, forming intricate diagrams, graceful calligraphy, and even tiny sketches. Around you, the rustling and scratching of other test-takers recede into a hushed encouragement. You feel the pressure of time, but it no longer terrifies you—it simply propels you forward.

When at last you finish, the page is full of luminous meaning, comprehensible only to your own heart. You look up and the professor, now wearing a kind expression, takes your paper and nods. You have no idea what grade you’ll receive, nor do you recall exactly what career this exam was supposed to lead you toward. Yet you feel satisfied. In that moment, as the dream begins to fade, you understand that the true test wasn’t to produce the “right” answers, but to trust your own capacity to illuminate what seemed unknowable.

And as the hall dissolves into morning light, you carry with you a quiet conviction that what matters most has always been inside you.
