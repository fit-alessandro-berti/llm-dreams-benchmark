As you approach the blank canvas, it hums with an almost electric energy, as if waiting for your touch. The air around it shimmers with unseen possibilities, and the colors of the world—vibrant, shifting, and alive—seem to recoil or lean in, as if deciding whether to merge with the canvas or remain free.

You reach out, and the moment your fingers brush its surface, the canvas *breathes*. It expands, stretching into an infinite plane, yet it remains weightless, like a whisper. The blankness isn’t empty—it’s a void of potential, a space where anything could take form.

Then, the first shape appears. A single, perfect circle, glowing with a soft gold light. It pulses gently, and as you watch, it begins to ripple outward, fracturing into smaller, intricate patterns—geometric, organic, impossible. The colors of the world around you start to bleed into the canvas, but they don’t settle. They swirl, merge, and separate, forming fleeting images: a city of glass towers that melt into rivers, a forest where the trees are made of music, a face that shifts between joy and sorrow with every blink.

You realize the canvas is alive—not just with your imagination, but with the dreams of everything around you. The landscape, the sky, even the air itself is feeding it. And now, it’s asking you to choose. Do you let it continue to dream on its own, or do you take control?

You hesitate, then press your palm flat against the surface. The moment you do, the canvas *responds*. The shifting shapes freeze for a heartbeat, then rearrange themselves into something new—a door. A door with no handle, no keyhole, just a smooth, silver surface that reflects not your face, but the world behind you.

A voice, soft and many-layered, whispers: *"Open it."*

What do you do?
