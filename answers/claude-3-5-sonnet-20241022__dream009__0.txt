Let me continue this dream scenario:

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to quickly adapt to survive in what appears to be medieval times. The air smells of wood smoke and herbs, and you find yourself in a small thatched-roof cottage. Through the window, you see people walking past in long tunics and simple dresses.

Your first instinct is to find someone who can help you understand where and when you are. You notice your own clothes have changed to match the period, and you're wearing rough-spun wool garments. As you step outside, you see a bustling village marketplace with traders bartering goods - no money changing hands, just exchanges of bread for cloth, pottery for vegetables.

A friendly-looking woman at a nearby stall notices your confused expression and waves you over. She introduces herself as Agnes and explains you're in a small English village during the 14th century. She seems oddly unsurprised by your presence, as if travelers from other times occasionally appear here.

Agnes offers to teach you the essential skills you'll need - how to identify edible plants, basic medicinal herbs, and the art of bartering. You realize this dream world operates on different rules, and you'll need to forget everything you know about modern life to survive here...
