…walk fast, then jog, then break into a run because every clock you pass says a different thing and none of them agree with your watch. You pat your pockets, but your phone is a smooth, mute slab, a postcard from nowhere with no buttons. The street signs are all in alphabets you almost recognize until you blink and they rearrange themselves into something else.

You stop a man in a long coat and ask, breathless, where the place might be. He smiles, shows you his empty hands and sings an answer in a language you can almost taste, rich and metallic like pennies. You pretend to understand and head in the direction his shoulders had been pointing, but with every block the buildings get taller, the streets narrower, the air thicker with the smell of rain on hot concrete.

A bus sighs to a stop in front of you, its windows fogged, its destination sign flickering between numbers and symbols. You climb on. Inside it's an aquarium; schools of silver fish drift past seats full of people reading newspapers with no print. There is no driver. The bus moves anyway, gliding between towers like a submarine between reefs. When it stops again, you're deposited in front of a building that is breathing, its glass façade expanding and contracting like a sleeping animal.

The doors part without you touching them. The lobby is an empty field of white, horizonless, except for a single elevator with buttons marked with seasons instead of floors. You jab "Autumn" because it's the only one that doesn't look like it's about to melt. The doors close, and you feel yourself moving sideways, then up, then down, then in.

When the doors open, you're in your middle school gymnasium. The varnished floor, the faded banners, the hum of fluorescent lights – you know this place in your bones. Rows of chairs are set up, and they are all filled with people. They all turn to look at you. Some are strangers in suits, some have faces from old photographs, some are you, older and younger, wearing clothes you forgot you owned. At the front of the room is a long table.

You remember, then, what the meeting is.

"You made it," says a voice. It's yours, from somewhere near the microphone.

You're torn between apologizing for being late and explaining you have no idea where "here" is, when you notice the clock on the wall. The second hand is trembling over the twelve, quivering, and the minute hand is firmly on the top of the hour. It hasn't moved.

You take a breath. Everyone is still looking at you, waiting for you to sit, to begin, to wake up.

Someone in the back raises their hand. It's your childhood self. "Do we have to start right away?" they ask. "We have all the time in the world."

And you do. You feel it in your chest, that the hour you were chasing has stretched, elastic, over this entire room, this entire city. The anxiety dissolves the way sugar does when you stir it into tea. You walk to your chair, feeling the floor ripple under your shoes like water, and as you sit, the world curls at the edges like burnt paper.

You open your mouth to speak, and the alarm goes off. The city, the gymnasium, the faces fold into the sound of your own waking.
