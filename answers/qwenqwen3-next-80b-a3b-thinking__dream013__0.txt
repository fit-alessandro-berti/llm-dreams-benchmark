You step through a door of shifting shadows and find yourself in a chamber where the air hums like a struck tuning fork. The floor is a mosaic of crumbling clock faces, their hands frozen at impossible angles. In the center, a sphere of liquid obsidian floats—a mirror reflecting not your face, but the shape of your breath. A plaque floats before it: *"What you see is not what you are. Take the shape of the void between heartbeats."*  

You focus. The sphere ripples. For a moment, you see a child drowning in a puddle of your childhood bedroom—then your own face, aged and hollow-eyed, whispering a riddle you’ll never remember. The air grows thick, pressing against your temples as if the maze itself is holding its breath. You close your eyes and *stop* thinking. You become the silence between the seconds of your heartbeat.  

The sphere shatters into a thousand glass butterflies. They swirl around you, each carrying a fragment of memory: your first bike ride, the taste of saltwater on a beach you’ve never visited, the warmth of a hand that’s long vanished. They land on the clock faces below, and the hands begin to spin—backward, forward, sideways—until the floor becomes a river of time. You step onto it, and the maze rewinds. Walls dissolve into mist. Staircases spiral upward into stars you already know.  

And then you realize: the maze wasn’t a prison. It was a key. Every puzzle solved was a lock turning inside *you*. As the final butterfly vanishes, you feel the weight of the maze lift—not from your shoulders, but from your bones. You are standing in a field of silver grass under a sky full of familiar constellations, but you know, with absolute certainty, that the maze was never outside. It was the landscape of your mind all along.  

And the real question dawns: *What will you choose to build next?*  

(You wake to the sound of rain tapping your window, laughter echoing from a dream that never was.)
