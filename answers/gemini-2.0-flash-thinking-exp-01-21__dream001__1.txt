You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panic slightly, your heart beginning to race.  You glance around wildly, trying to find something familiar, a landmark, a street sign, anything.  But the buildings are all impossibly tall and twist in ways that defy geometry, casting long, distorted shadows. You pull out your phone, hoping for a map or an address, but the screen remains stubbornly blank, showing only a faint static shimmer.  Frustration mounts, and you decide to ask for help.  Spotting a figure draped in shimmering, iridescent cloth disappearing down a narrow alleyway, you call out, "Excuse me!  Can you help me?"

The figure pauses, its back still to you.  It slowly turns, and you see it's not a person at all, but a large, iridescent beetle, its carapace gleaming like polished gemstones.  It clicks its mandibles and in a surprisingly clear voice, says, "Meeting?  Clocktower district. Follow the scent of cinnamon and regret."  Confused but desperate, you nod dumbly.  The beetle scuttles into the alley, and a faint, sweet smell of cinnamon wafts from the darkness, tinged with a strange, metallic undertone that you somehow recognize as regret.  Hesitantly, you step into the alley, the towering buildings seeming to lean in above you. The alley twists and turns, becoming narrower and darker, but the scent of cinnamon grows stronger, leading you deeper into the city's labyrinthine heart.

As you walk, the alley walls begin to shift and ripple, the brickwork morphing into smooth, obsidian-like surfaces.  Whispers seem to echo from the walls, fragments of conversations and forgotten promises.  The scent of cinnamon intensifies, now mixed with the faint sound of ticking, growing louder with each step. You emerge from the alley into a square bathed in an unnatural, amber light.  In the center of the square stands a towering clocktower, its hands spinning wildly in reverse.  The air is thick with the scent of cinnamon, so strong it's almost overwhelming.  But something is wrong. The clocktower is melting, its stone facade dripping like candle wax, and the ticking sound is now a deafening, chaotic cacophony.  A sense of dread washes over you.  This isn't the meeting place.  This is… the Clocktower of Lost Time.

Suddenly, the amber light flickers and fades, replaced by a jarring white.  The melting clocktower dissolves into swirling mist, and the deafening ticking abruptly ceases.  You are standing in the square, but it's different now.  The buildings have shifted again, becoming less defined, more like impressions of buildings.  The cinnamon scent is gone, replaced by the faint, metallic tang of ozone.  You glance at your wrist, where you think your watch should be, but your arm is strangely numb and featureless.  The feeling of urgency about the meeting is still there, but it’s muted, distant, like a fading echo.  You are still lost, but the panic has subsided, replaced by a strange sense of detachment.  The dream is slipping away, the city dissolving around you like smoke, leaving behind only a lingering taste of cinnamon and the unsettling feeling that time itself is running backwards, or perhaps, just… melting.
