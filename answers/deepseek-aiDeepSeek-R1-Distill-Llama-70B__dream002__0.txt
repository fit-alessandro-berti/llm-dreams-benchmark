the air grows thick with electricity. Dark clouds descend, twisting into ominous shapes above you. The first drops hit the ground with a sharp patter, quickly growing into a relentless downpour. The wind howls through the trees, their branches swaying violently as if trying to shake off the weight of the storm.

You quicken your pace, searching for shelter, but the forest seems endless. Lightning splits the sky, casting eerie flashes across the drenched landscape. Thunder booms in response, shaking the ground beneath your feet. The rain stings your skin, blurring your vision as you squint through the deluge.

Then, through the veil of rain, you see it—a faint light in the distance. It glows warmly, a beacon of safety in the chaos. You stumble toward it, your clothes soaked and heavy, your breath coming in ragged gasps. As you get closer, the light clarifies into the window of a small, old cabin, half-hidden among the trees. Smoke curls from the chimney, blending with the mist that rises from the sodden earth.

You fling open the creaky door and step inside, water pooling at your feet. The cabin is dimly lit, its wooden walls lined with strange, ancient trinkets and flickering candles. A fire crackles in the hearth, sending shadows dancing across the room. You shiver, feeling the warmth seep into your chilled bones.

But as you turn to shut the door, you realize you're not alone. A figure stands just beyond the edge of the light, their presence silent and unseen until now. You can't make out their features, but you sense their gaze upon you. The air in the cabin seems to thicken, and for a moment, you wonder if you've found safety—or something far more sinister.

The storm rages on outside, but in here, time feels suspended. And as the figure steps forward, you realize that this cabin, this moment, is only the beginning of a mystery you can't yet comprehend.
