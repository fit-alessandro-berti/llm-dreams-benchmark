As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and **obstacles that seem to shift like sand beneath your feet.**

First, you are tasked with solving a puzzle in a library where the books fly away if you read them too loudly. You learn to listen to the whispers of the pages instead, finding the answer in the silence between the words. Next, you must navigate a maze made of mirrors, but every reflection shows a version of yourself who gave up. You have to walk forward without looking at your doubts, trusting only the path ahead.

Just when you think you've reached the final round, the ground dissolves, and you find yourself standing on a cloud before a panel of judges whose faces are blurred by a soft, golden mist. They don't ask you technical questions or test your skills. Instead, they ask, *"Why does this job matter to you when no one is watching?"*

You take a deep breath, the air tasting like rain and old paper, and you speak from your heart about the impact you want to make, not for the title, but for the people you hope to help.

As your voice fades, the mist clears. The judges smile, not with human lips, but with a warm light that envelops you. One of them hands you a simple, wooden key. "The job was never about the title," they say, their voices echoing like a distant bell. "It was about becoming the person who could hold this key."

You reach out to take it, your fingers brushing the warm wood, and suddenly—

**You wake up.**

Your heart is racing, but your hand is clenched tight, as if you are still holding the key. The morning light filters through your curtains, and for a moment, the feeling of the dream lingers, leaving you with a strange, unshakeable certainty that you are ready for whatever comes next.
