I try to remember what my speech was supposed to be about, but when I look down at my notes, they're written in a language that shifts and changes - sometimes it's musical notation, sometimes it's the tracks of birds in snow. My podium has grown roots that dig deep into the stage, and flowers are beginning to bloom from the microphone.

The ceiling of the auditorium has disappeared, replaced by a swirling galaxy. Someone in the front row is knitting what appears to be a scarf made of evening light. I realize my shoes have become boats, and the stage is now a calm ocean. The audience members are sitting in floating chairs, gently bobbing on the waves.

I decide this is the perfect time to deliver my speech through interpretive dance, and as I move, the words I meant to say appear as glowing letters in the air, rearranging themselves into constellations that tell my story better than I ever could have spoken it...
