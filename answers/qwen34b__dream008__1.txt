**Dream Continuation:**  

The fluorescent lights hummed like a swarm of agitated wasps, casting jagged shadows across the polished floor of your office. Your desk, cluttered with half-filled spreadsheets and a single, blinking monitor, seemed to pulse with the weight of the moment. Your boss, a figure taller than you’d ever imagined, loomed in the doorway. His suit was too sharp, his eyes too sharp—like two knives reflecting the flicker of a dying lamp.  

“You’re late,” he said, his voice a low, grinding rumble that made the walls vibrate. “The project. The deadline. *Now.*”  

You stared at the screen, where a single line of code scrolled endlessly, a shimmering serpent coiling through the void. The project? It was supposed to be a simple analytics report for the quarterly review. But now, the task had morphed into something grotesque: *Build a bridge between the human and the infinite, using only the bones of a single broken clock and the whispers of a thousand forgotten dreams.*  

Your coworkers, once clustered around you, had vanished. The walls dissolved into a kaleidoscope of impossible colors, and the clock on the wall began to melt, its hands dissolving into smoke that curled into shapes—*faces, hands, hearts*—before vanishing. Time itself seemed to fracture. You tried to scream, but your voice became a series of static bursts, echoing through the room like a broken radio.  

“*You’ve always had the power,*” the boss whispered, his reflection in the window shifting into a version of yourself—dressed in a tuxedo, laughing, chasing a butterfly through a field of floating equations. “*You just never wanted to see the truth.*”  

The truth? The project wasn’t a task. It was a *test*. A mirror. The deadline wasn’t a date—it was a *threshold*. You realized, with a dawning horror, that the boss wasn’t your boss. He was *your mind*, twisted by the pressure of all the things you’d never finished, all the dreams you’d buried under the weight of “*real work*.”  

You tried to run, but the floor had turned to liquid glass. You tried to scream, but your voice became a song, a lullaby of forgotten hopes. The clock’s smoke swirled into a vortex, and you were pulled into it—into a memory you’d never remembered: a child, standing on the edge of a cliff, holding a lantern that glowed with the light of a thousand stars.  

“*You don’t have to finish,*” the boss said, now a shadow in the vortex. “*You just have to *begin*.*”  

The vortex collapsed into a single point of light. You felt yourself dissolve, not into nothingness, but into a vast, infinite expanse of possibility. The clock’s hands were still there, but they no longer ticked. They *wove*.  

When you opened your eyes, the office was empty. The monitor was still on, but the screen showed nothing. Only a single word, glowing softly:  

**“Begin.”**  

You blinked. The clock on the wall was still melting, but now it was beautiful.
