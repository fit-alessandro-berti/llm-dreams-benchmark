You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. Panic claws at your throat, a cold knot of dread tightening with each passing second. The city is a labyrinth of towering, decaying structures, their facades adorned with faded murals and graffiti that whispers of a forgotten past. 

The air is thick with the scent of decay and a strange, metallic tang that makes your stomach churn.  People rush past, their faces obscured by masks or hoods, their movements jerky and hurried. You try to follow their paths, but the city seems to shift and twist around you, the streets blurring into a confusing maze. 

You pull out your phone, its screen flickering with a faint, useless glow. No signal. You frantically search your pockets, finding only a crumpled map, its edges frayed and illegible. It's a map of the city, but it's not the one you need. It's a map of the city before the fall, before the world went mad. 

You're running out of time. The meeting, whatever it is, is crucial. You need to find it, and fast. 

You decide to try a different approach. You start to observe. You watch the people, their movements, their conversations. You notice a pattern, a rhythm to the city's chaos. You see a group of people huddled around a flickering neon sign, their faces illuminated by the flickering light. You approach them cautiously, hoping they might have some information. 

As you get closer, you realize they're not just any group. They're scavengers, their clothes patched and worn, their faces etched with the hardships of survival. They speak in hushed tones, their eyes darting around, their hands constantly fidgeting. 

"You need to find the Clock Tower," one of them whispers, his voice raspy and low. "It's the only place left that still holds the old maps." 

He points to a faded mural on the wall, a clock tower with its hands frozen at midnight. The clock tower. It's a beacon, a symbol of hope in this decaying city. 

You feel a surge of hope. You know where to go. You just need to find your way there. 


What will you do next?
