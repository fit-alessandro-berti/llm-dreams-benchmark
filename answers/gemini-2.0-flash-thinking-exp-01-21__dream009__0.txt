You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **understand the language**.

The sun beats down on cobblestone streets, not asphalt.  The air smells of woodsmoke and something vaguely…animal.  You’re wearing clothes that feel rough and unfamiliar, scratchy wool against your skin. Panic flares in your chest as you see people bustling around, dressed in tunics and leather, some leading horses, others carrying baskets overflowing with produce.  There are no cars, no electricity poles, no familiar hum of civilization. Just the clatter of wooden wheels on stone, the shouts of vendors, and the rhythmic clang of what sounds like a blacksmith's hammer.

You try to speak, to ask someone where you are, but the words that come out sound alien to your own ears. You try again, louder, gesturing wildly, but the people you approach just stare back with confusion, their brows furrowing.  They speak to you in return, a torrent of sounds that are completely incomprehensible, like a song sung in a language you’ve never heard.

Fear begins to creep in, cold and clammy. You're lost, utterly and completely lost, not just geographically, but temporally.  You’re adrift in a sea of the past, and you can't even ask for directions.  You realize with a sinking feeling that without understanding what anyone is saying, you are completely helpless. You can’t ask for food, for shelter, for information.  You’re an invisible ghost in a world that is bustling around you, oblivious and uncaring.

Therefore, the absolute, most pressing need that slams into you with the force of a physical blow is this: **you need to understand the language**.  It’s the key to everything. It’s the bridge to survival, to connection, to any hope of navigating this strange, beautiful, and terrifying new reality.  Your dream sharpens into a single, urgent focus:  find a way to understand, to listen, to learn, to decipher the sounds that swirl around you, and somehow, *somehow*, begin to speak again.
