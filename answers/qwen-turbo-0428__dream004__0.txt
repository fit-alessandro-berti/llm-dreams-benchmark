You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and feel an irresistible pull toward it. It floats in midair, untouched by time or gravity. As you approach, the canvas begins to shimmer, as if it's alive, waiting for your touch.

You reach out, and without thinking, you pick up a brush that materializes in your hand. The bristles are made of light, and the paint is not contained in a jar but flows freely from your mind, shaped by your thoughts. You dip the brush into the air, and a swirl of emotion—joy, sorrow, curiosity—drips onto the canvas.

As you paint, the world around you reacts. The sky pulses with your strokes, the ground ripples like water, and the very air hums with the rhythm of your creation. A forest of floating geometric shapes grows from the edges of the canvas, bending and twisting in harmony with your imagination.

Then, a voice whispers, *“What will you create next?”*

You pause, considering. The canvas is endless, the possibilities infinite. You close your eyes, breathe deeply, and begin again.

This time, you paint a door. Not just any door, but one that leads to a memory you’ve forgotten. As the final stroke dries, the door creaks open, revealing a hallway lined with mirrors. Each mirror shows a different version of yourself—some familiar, some strange, all true in their own way.

You step through.

And the dream continues...
