You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you – the last slice of the cosmic pizza, which legend says grants the eater the ability to understand the language of squirrels. You insist it's your turn, as you bought the pizza from the astral vendor last Tuesday. They counter that they *found* the vendor, deep in the Nebula of Nacho Cheese, and therefore have prior claim.

The air crackles with frustration. Your friend's face is a mask of stubbornness, their normally twinkling eyes like chips of flint. Your own heart is pounding. This isn't just about squirrel-speak; it's about fairness, about being heard!

And then, you decide to **settle this with a trial by ridiculousness.**

"Alright!" you declare, your voice suddenly booming, echoing strangely in what you now realize is no longer your living room but a vast, purple amphitheater filled with sleepy badgers in tiny judge's wigs. "If you believe your claim is superior, then you must prove it... by yodeling the theme song to 'Knight Rider' whilst balancing a teacup full of starlight on your nose!"

Your friend blinks, the anger momentarily replaced by utter confusion. Then, a slow grin spreads across their face. "Oh, it's *on*! But if I succeed, you must recite the entire history of dust bunnies, backwards, in interpretive dance!"

A hush falls over the badger-filled amphitheater. One particularly portly badger adjusts its wig and bangs a tiny gavel made of a twig. The cosmic pizza slice, now glowing with an impatient light, hovers between you. The challenge is set. Your friend takes a deep breath, wobbles a teacup precariously filled with shimmering starlight onto their nose, and opens their mouth, a surprisingly powerful yodel beginning to form... "Duunnn duuun, du-du-duuunnn duuun..."

You can't help but grin. This is going to be the best dream-argument resolution ever.
