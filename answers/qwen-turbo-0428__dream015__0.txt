You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to build a sanctuary—a hidden garden in the ruins of a once-great city. You scavenge for seeds, water, and tools, using your knowledge of botany and survival to cultivate life in the wasteland.

As days turn into weeks, the garden begins to bloom. You grow vegetables, herbs, and even flowers that remind you of the world before the collapse. The air is thick with dust and silence, but here, there is color, scent, and hope.

One day, you hear a distant sound—something unfamiliar. A voice. You follow it, heart pounding, through the crumbling streets. You find another survivor, a young woman, injured but alive. She tells you she's been searching for others, for a place where people can start over.

Together, you work to expand the garden, turning it into a refuge. You teach her what you've learned, and she brings new skills—medicine, engineering, storytelling. Slowly, more people find their way to your sanctuary, drawn by rumors of a place where life still grows.

But not everyone shares your vision. A group of raiders, desperate and violent, hears of your garden and comes to take it. They see only scarcity, not possibility. You must decide: fight to protect what you've built, or find another way to bring peace to a broken world.

What will you do?
