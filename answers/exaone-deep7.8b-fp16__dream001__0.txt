**Continuation of the Dream:**  

You panic, your heart racing as you realize every second counts. The city stretches endlessly, its skyline sharp and undecipherable. You glance skywardâ€”the sun hangs low, casting long shadows like the cityâ€™s tangled veins. A flicker of memory strikes: the first time you visited this place, you noticed a landmark that no one ever mentioned. You spot it now: a towering clocktower engraved with "HANDS ON TRUST." Itâ€™s your only lead.  

You sprint toward it, dodging alleys and crowds, until you reach the base. Inside, a spiral staircase winds upward, lit by flickering lanterns. At the top, the meeting room glows ahead. Inside, you grasp the agenda like a lifeline, though your shoes splash in puddles as you sprint downward. When you stabilize, you realize the meeting began just moments agoâ€”and youâ€™re a perfect minute late.  

But the room hums with agreement. The host smiles, says, "Good time," and hands you a key. Behind them lies a vault thatâ€™s never lockedâ€”inside, a note: *The greatest meetings need urgency, not accuracy.* A sigh of relief radiates as you escape, the city dissolving behind you like a mist.

**FINAL LINE:**  
You wake in your room, clutching the note and a coffee, laughing at the absurd dream that tested your rhythm. The real meeting tomorrow youâ€™ll prepare meticulouslyâ€”no more city-sized anxiety. ðŸ•’âœ¨
