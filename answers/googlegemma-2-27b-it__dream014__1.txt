...hesitated for a heartbeat. Not that I needed a thank you, not from them.  They were harmless-looking enough; a middle-aged couple with twinkling eyes and shopping bags, a young boy clutching a brightly colored balloon, and a street artist, his fingers stained with a rainbow of paint, smiling gently at me as the vibrant cityscape spun around us in a dizzying blur. They seemed genuinely concerned, these souls who materialized out of the throngs of people, their faces alight with the warmth of human connection. The man with the paint-stained hands, a tall, lanky fellow with a knowing smile and paint-splattered overalls, had stepped forward and spoken first. "Excuse me," he'd said, his voice a soothing wave in the noisy current of the city, "but are you alright? You seem a bit lost."

His kind eyes, framed by paint-stained hair, held a genuine worry that pierced through the overwhelming confusion I was feeling.

"Lost?" I echoed, bewildered. Everywhere I looked was a cacophony of sound and movement, a cacophony of words, honks, and distant sirens weaving through the constant flow of pedestrians, taxis, and bicycles. Was I lost in the sense of physical location, or in something more profound?

The truth was, I wasn't entirely sure where I was going either way. I'd had arrived at this crowded square with a vague sense of purpose. Find my way? Find *what*? My reflection still held the terror of someone lost at sea, adrift in a sea of faces and unfamiliar sounds.

"Do you know where you're going?" the woman, dressed in a brightly colored kimono, asked the boy holding the balloon. 

He tugged at his sleeve playfully, still smiling, AChilling grin hidden beneath a greasy mop of hair and a tangle of colored paint splattered on his apron, almost seemed to swallow him whole.
