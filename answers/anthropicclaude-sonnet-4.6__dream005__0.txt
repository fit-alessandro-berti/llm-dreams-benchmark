...the air has that particular dream-thickness to it, where sounds arrive slightly delayed and faces keep rearranging themselves when you look away.

You push through a cluster of people near what seems to be a fireplace — except the flames are burning a quiet, impossible blue — and everyone is laughing at a joke you just missed. Someone hands you a drink without looking at you. It's warm in your hand. You don't drink it.

You think you see your person across the room. You raise your hand. But the crowd shifts like a slow tide and they're gone, replaced by a woman in a yellow cardigan who is explaining something intensely to a houseplant.

A group pulls you in near a long table. They seem to know you. They use your name. They ask about *the project* — and somehow you know exactly what to say, the words arriving in your mouth before your mind produces them. Everyone nods. You feel briefly, warmly belonging. Then one of them tilts their head at an angle that heads don't quite tilt, and you remember to keep moving.

The house is larger inside than outside. There are rooms you didn't notice before. A hallway that definitely wasn't there.

And then — around a corner, beside a window showing weather that belongs to a different season — there they are. Your person. Their face the one face in the room that stays *still* when you look at it.

They're already looking at you, as though they've been watching you search this whole time.

*"There you are,"* they say.

And you can't tell, in the soft collapsing logic of the dream, whether they mean they found *you* — or whether they've been lost this whole time too, and you were the one they needed.

You open your mouth to answer.

The blue fire crackles.

The music changes key.

And you—
