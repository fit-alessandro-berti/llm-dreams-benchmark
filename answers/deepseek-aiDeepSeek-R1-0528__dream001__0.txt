You start to frantically pat your pockets, hoping for a clue – a business card, a crumpled note, *anything*. Your fingers brush against cold, unfamiliar metal. You pull out an ornate, antique pocket watch you've never seen before. Its face is blank except for a single, glowing red arrow pointing insistantly down a narrow, shadowed alleyway to your right.

**Panic sharpens into focus.** The city around you seems to pulse – towering chrome-and-glass buildings morph subtly, street signs flicker with unreadable symbols, and the crowd flows past like a river of faceless silhouettes. Time feels thick and slow, yet the watch's silent ticking vibrates in your bones.

You have no choice. You plunge into the alley. It smells of damp stone and ozone. The arrow on the watch shifts minutely as you move, guiding you through a labyrinth of service tunnels, across a suddenly empty plaza echoing with phantom footsteps, and up a spiraling fire escape that materializes on the side of a monolithic black building.

**Thirty minutes left.** The watch leads you to a nondescript, polished obsidian door on the 40th floor. The arrow spins wildly, then points straight at it. You take a deep breath, smooth your rumpled dream-clothes, and push the door open.

Inside is not a boardroom, but a vast, silent library under a dome depicting a swirling nebula. Dust motes dance in beams of impossible light. At the center, on a simple wooden chair, sits an old man with kind, impossibly deep eyes. He smiles gently at your bewildered expression.

"Ah," he says, his voice like rustling pages. "You found the meeting place. Right on time." He gestures to an identical chair opposite him. "Sit. The agenda is simple: *Why were you so afraid you wouldn't find it?*"

**The dream lingers...** The urgency dissolves, replaced by profound stillness. The watch in your hand feels warm, its blank face now reflecting the nebula above. The important meeting wasn't about business; it was a rendezvous with a deeper part of yourself, guided by an unexpected symbol through the maze of your own anxieties. The city outside fades, leaving only the library, the old man's patient gaze, and the question hanging in the starlit air.
