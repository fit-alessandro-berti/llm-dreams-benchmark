...the air suddenly tastes like copper and static electricity. The sky above doesn't turn gray, but fractures like a broken mirror, revealing a deep, swirling violet void behind the blue. The wind doesn't howl; it hums a low, vibrating frequency that you feel in your teeth rather than hear with your ears. You look down and realize the moss beneath your feet is turning into glass. With each flash of lightning—which strikes silently and in slow motion—the forest freezes in a new position, twisting and stretching like surreal clockwork, until the trees are bending down to look you in the face, waiting for the rain to begin.
