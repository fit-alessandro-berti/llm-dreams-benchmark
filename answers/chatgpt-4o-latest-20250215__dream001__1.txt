walk through the city streets, hoping to find a clue. The buildings around you are towering and shimmering, their surfaces shifting like liquid glass. Every time you look away and then back, the architecture has slightly changed—doors appear where there were none, street names rewrite themselves, and the skyline warps in slow, hypnotic waves.

You check your phone, but the screen is blank except for a pulsing countdown—58 minutes left. A sudden gust of wind carries whispers, unintelligible but urgent, and you have the eerie sense that the city itself is guiding you.

A sleek, black tram hums to a stop beside you, its doors opening without a driver. The sign above flickers between symbols and a name you almost recognize. Do you get on? The thought lingers in your mind like an echo.

Before you can decide, a stranger in a cobalt-blue suit touches your shoulder. His face is blurred, as if it refuses to be remembered, but his voice is familiar. “You’re late,” he says, tilting his head toward the tram. “You don’t want to miss this.”

Do you step inside? Or do you keep searching on foot? The choice feels heavy, as though it will change more than just your destination.
