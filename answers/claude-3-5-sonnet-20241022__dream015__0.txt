Let me continue this dream scenario:

I decide to establish a small but sustainable community in the ruins of an old botanical garden. The glass-domed greenhouses are mostly intact, and there's potential to grow food year-round. I gather survivors who each bring unique skills - a former nurse, a carpenter, an engineer, and a teacher among them.

Together, we repair the greenhouse panels and create an ingenious water collection system from the dome's structure. We cultivate herbs with medicinal properties alongside vegetables and fruits. The garden becomes our sanctuary, hidden from hostile groups by strategic plantings of thorny vines and dense foliage.

At night, I keep watch from the highest point of the dome, looking out at the stars that seem brighter now without light pollution. The world may be broken, but in our glass-enclosed eden, we're nurturing something precious - not just plants, but hope. We trade seeds and knowledge with peaceful travelers, slowly building a network of similar communities.

In the dream, even amidst desolation, life finds a way to bloom anew.
