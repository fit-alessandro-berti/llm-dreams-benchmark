I'm completely immersed in the dream now. As I'm navigating through the complex maze, I feel a sense of unease and trepidation. The air is thick with an otherworldly energy, and the walls seem to shift and writhe like living serpents. My eyes adjust to the dim light, and I see that the maze is filled with intricate patterns and symbols etched into the stone.

As I make my way deeper into the maze, I encounter my first puzzle. It's a seemingly impossible riddle, etched into the wall in bold letters:

"Three switches, but no lights.

A candle is placed on one switch.
Another is placed on a third switch.
How can you determine which switch controls the flame?"

I think back to the conventional methods of solving such puzzles – examining the surrounding environment, looking for patterns or inconsistencies. But something about this puzzle seems different. I sense that there's a hidden pattern or connection between the three switches.

I recall a principle of logic I've learned in school, the concept of "ceteris paribus." In essence, it means that when one variable is changed, the other variables remain the same. I think quickly, and my mind starts racing with possibilities.

After a few tense moments of contemplation, I realize that the key to this puzzle lies in the fact that I don't need to directly observe the switch controls. Instead, I can observe the relationships between the three switches. I notice that the candle is placed on the third switch, and I start to connect the dots between the switch controls and the candle's flame.

In my mind's eye, I see a subtle pattern – the three switches are all controlled by different inputs, and the candle's flame is a result of the correct combination of these inputs. The implications are staggering: if I flip the third switch, I'll be able to light the candle, revealing the correct solution to the puzzle.

With a sense of excitement and confidence, I flip the third switch, and the candle's flame flickers to life. The other two switches are then revealed, and I realize that the pattern was simple yet profound: the candle's flame is triggered by a switch connected to a single input (the third switch), while the two other switches are connected to switches controlled by other inputs (the first and second switches).

I've solved the puzzle! The maze seems to dissolve around me, and I'm left with a sense of accomplishment and wonder. I've solved a complex puzzle that would have stumped most people, and it's all because of my intuition and creative thinking.
