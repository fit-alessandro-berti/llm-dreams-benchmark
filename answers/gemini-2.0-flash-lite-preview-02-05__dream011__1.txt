You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are **written in a language I've never seen before. It's a swirling, intricate script, like a cross between ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and the flowing calligraphy of a language from some distant, alien world. My heart leaps into my throat. Panic starts to bubble up, hot and fast. I try to focus, to remember anything from the lectures, any clue about this impossible language, but my mind is a blank white canvas. Every time I try to interpret a symbol, the image shifts, morphs, and becomes something else entirely. It's like looking at a Rorschach test designed by a particularly cruel god.

The professor, a stern-faced woman with eyes that seem to pierce right through me, begins to walk down the aisles, her footsteps echoing in the enormous, silent hall. Each step feels like a hammer blow, a countdown to my impending doom. I desperately try to call out to her, to beg for help, to plead for a translation, but my voice is trapped. It's as if my vocal cords have turned to stone.

Then, as the professor nears my desk, the room begins to shimmer. The walls ripple like water, and the alien script on the exam papers seems to writhe and twist. The other students, who were once focused and studious, now look like they're melting, their faces contorted in expressions of silent, agonizing terror. Their papers blur, and the strange symbols on their exams seem to reach out, grasping at me.

The professor stops directly beside me. She leans down, her breath cold on my neck, and whispers a single word, a sound that somehow resonates deep within my bones, despite being incomprehensible. It feels both ancient and alien, a word of power and a promise of failure all rolled into one. The word... is... "Glitch."

And then, the world dissolves. The room, the exam, the professor – everything vanishes, replaced by an infinite, swirling vortex of that impossible script. I feel like I'm falling, falling endlessly through a sea of symbols I can't understand, a prisoner in a language that holds the key to my entire future. And the only thing I can do is scream... but no sound comes out.**
