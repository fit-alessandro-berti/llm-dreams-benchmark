You start to panic, your heart racing as you glance at your watch—only it's not a watch anymore; it's a tiny hourglass strapped to your wrist, with sand trickling down in glowing blue streams. The city around you pulses with life, skyscrapers twisting like vines reaching for a sun that's somehow both rising and setting at once. Pedestrians hurry by, but their faces are blurred, like half-forgotten memories, and when you try to stop one—a tall figure in a suit made of shimmering newspaper clippings—they dissolve into a flock of pigeons that scatter into the air, cooing directions in a language that sounds like echoing laughter.

Desperate, you pull out your phone, but the screen displays a map that's alive, streets wriggling like worms and buildings sprouting eyes that wink at you knowingly. "Turn left at the whispering fountain," it instructs in a tinny voice, so you do, weaving through alleyways where shadows dance without bodies and street vendors sell dreams in little glass vials. Time slips away faster now—the hourglass on your wrist is nearly empty—and you spot a door at the end of an endless staircase, labeled "Meeting Room: Reality Optional."

You burst through, breathless, only to find the room filled with versions of yourself from different timelines: one sipping coffee confidently, another scribbling notes on floating parchments, and a third lounging on a cloud-shaped chair, waving you over. "You're just in time," they all say in unison, their voices merging into yours. The meeting begins, but it's not about business—it's about unraveling the threads of your worries, and as the discussion flows into absurdity, the city outside fades, replaced by a serene meadow where clocks bloom like flowers.

You wake up smiling, the dream lingering like a half-remembered adventure, wondering if that meeting was ever real at all.
