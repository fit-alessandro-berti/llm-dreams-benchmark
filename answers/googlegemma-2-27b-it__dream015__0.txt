... plant a garden.

The rusted hulk of what was once a school bus loomed before me, a stark reminder of the world that was. But as I stared at it, half-buried in the sand, a strange sense of hope bloomed in the pit of my stomach.

It wasn't easy. This desolate patch of earth, a ghost town swallowed by desert winds, offered little promise. Cobwebs clung to the skeletal remains of swing sets and sand clogged the cracks in the pavement where the sidewalk once snaked through a schoolyard that now resembled a barren wasteland. The others scavenged for cans, for weapons, for anything that could be traded for a ration pack and a few hours of uneasy sleep. But not me. 

I envisioned a sea of green, a stark contrast to this sun-baked monument to a forgotten time, reminding me, and everyone else who saw it, that life, even in this ravaged world, could still blossom.

The only scrap of fertile land left was a lonely patch behind the bus, a little miracle of untouched earth in the shadow of crumbling buildings and empty streets. A small, battered hose lay nearby, a lonely testament to a civilization that once cared for its green spaces. But that hose, I realized, was all I needed.

And so, I decided to plant a garden. It wouldn't be easy, the sun baked everything in this landscape. But I could salvage seeds from the abandoned store across the street - a remnant of the time when shelves bent under the weight of abundance - and try again. I'd spend hours in that dry, cracked dirt, tending to the tiny sprouts, whispering encouragement to them through the dry winds that zipped past.  The others might scoff, but I had tasted nothing sweeter than those parched seeds bursting into green shoots. In the dust-blasted ruins, the promise of life was far too alluring to dismiss, too precious beneath their brittle shells.

I gathered what supplies I could find: a cracked pot, rusted garden shears, a dusty bucket. The land was arid, unforgiving. But with a little ingenuity and elbow grease, I'd coax life out of this desolate world, even if only in a small, blistering patch behind a forgotten school bus. The dream slipped in and out of my hands like grains of sand. 

For I knew this desert earth well. It wasn't good at nurturing dreams.

It was going to take time. Every day under a charcoal sky, I worked the earth, cleared the debris, and meticulously planted the seeds I'd salvaged from the ruins of the supermarket.

The sound of laughter erupted in the Carrefour, dreams blossoming into golden flowers above my head, tearing through the thick, heavy silence that usually clung to the place. Laughter hadn't echoed in this sprawling ruin for years, yet it fills the space, warming the dry air.

I follow the sound, my feet picking their way through a world transformed into a wasteland of opportunity. The dry dusty ground, the glimpse of shattered glass in the distance, a skeleton of a car echoing my own growing hollowness. 

This scarcescary world, stripped of all its former vibrancy, felt strangely…abundant in this dream. But

Can I cultivate an oasis in this wasteland of my subconscious? I didn't know, but I reasoned that I could plant my own happy dreams.



Those first precious plants I had been nurturing sprung up faster and more succinctly than I can ever describe.

Can I make this dismal concrete world flourish with life, even in my mind, the seeds wouldn't rise. They wouldn't sprout.

I find a generation in this dream, ranging in age from infants, sleeping soundly despite the harshness of their surroundings in the shade of a forgotten, melodious dream. I decided to plant some seeds I had found in that shop. They were a hodgepodge of forgotten textures, forgotten tastes. Behind the throne of twisted metal, I see it.
