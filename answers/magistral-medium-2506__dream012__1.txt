steel your resolve, gripping the ship’s wheel tightly. The wind howls like a vengeful spirit, and waves crash against the hull like thunderous fists. Salt stings your face, but your eyes remain fixed on the horizon—where the storm’s fury seems to part just slightly, revealing a faint, eerie glow.

Your first mate shouts over the gale, *"Captain, we can’t hold much longer! The sails are tearing!"*

You don’t flinch. Instead, you remember the old seafarer’s tale your grandfather once told—that storms like this are not just weather, but gateways. And that glow… it’s not lightning. It’s something else.

With a voice steady as the keel beneath your feet, you order, *"Hard to starboard! Aim for the light!"*

The crew hesitates, but they trust you. The ship groans as it cuts through the waves, riding the storm’s wrath like a wild beast. As you near the glow, the winds suddenly die down. The sea flattens. And there, before you, rises a spectral island—a place not on any map, where the trees shimmer like silver and the air hums with forgotten magic.

A lone figure stands on the shore, clad in robes that ripple like water. Their voice echoes in your mind: *"You’ve sailed through the Veil, Captain. Few ever do."*

Your heart pounds. Are you dreaming? Or have you crossed into something far greater?

What do you do next?

1. **Order the crew to prepare to dock—this is a chance for answers.**
2. **Turn the ship away—the sea has its secrets, and some are best left untouched.**
3. **Step forward alone, asking the figure what they want with you.**
4. **Grab your compass—it’s spinning wildly, as if the laws of the world have shifted.**

(Let me know which path you’d take, and we’ll see where the dream leads!)
