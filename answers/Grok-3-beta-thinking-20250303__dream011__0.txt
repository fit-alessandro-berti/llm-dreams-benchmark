You are dreaming. You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are a strange amalgamation of languages, some you recognize but can’t fully comprehend, others completely foreign. They delve into your personal life, asking you to analyze your deepest fears, evaluate your relationships, and predict your future successes and failures as if they were part of the curriculum. The words shift and twist on the page, a mix of strange symbols and letters that seem to crawl as you stare at them. You glance around, and everyone else is scribbling furiously, as if they understand perfectly. Panic sets in—your future depends on this, and you can’t even make sense of the first question.
