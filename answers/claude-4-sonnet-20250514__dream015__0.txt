...build a garden.

In the crumbling ruins of what was once a shopping mall, sunlight streams through the broken glass ceiling, creating perfect growing conditions. You begin collecting seeds from abandoned stores - packets that somehow survived in their foil wrappings. Tomatoes, herbs, wildflowers.

As you clear debris and rubble, others begin to notice. A child appears first, drawn by the bright green of your first sprouting plants. Then an elderly woman who remembers how to preserve food. A young man who knows how to fix the old irrigation pipes.

The garden becomes something more than sustenance. People start trading stories along with supplies. Someone brings a salvaged guitar, another shares knowledge of edible plants growing wild in the ruins. The space transforms into a hub of hope - proof that life persists, that beauty can emerge from destruction.

By winter, you've not only grown enough food to help feed your small community, but cultivated something even more precious: the belief that the world can be rebuilt, one seed at a time. The garden stands as a green defiance against the wasteland, a dream taking root in reality.

The smell of blooming flowers mingles with the metallic scent of rust, and for the first time since the world ended, you smile genuinely as you fall asleep under stars visible through the broken ceiling.
