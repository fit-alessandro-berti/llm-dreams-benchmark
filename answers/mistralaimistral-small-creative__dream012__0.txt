**The Dream Continues…**

The wind howls like a living thing, tearing at the sails with jagged fingers. The *Black Marlin*—your ship—groans beneath the weight of the waves, her timbers straining as if she might splinter at any moment. Salt stings your eyes, but you don’t dare blink. Not now.

Your first mate, **Elias Vey**, a grizzled man with a scar running from his temple to his jaw, grips the wheel beside you. His knuckles are white. *"Captain,"* he shouts over the storm, *"the starboard hull’s taking on water! If we don’t turn into the wind, we’ll be swamped!"*

You know he’s right. But turning into the storm means risking the *Marlin*’s mast—already creaking ominously—or worse, being driven onto the **Shattered Teeth**, the jagged reefs that lurk just beyond the storm’s fury. The charts call them a death trap. The sailors call them *hungry*.

Then you see it.

A light.

Not the sickly green glow of storm lightning, but a **steady, golden pulse**, flickering like a beacon from the heart of the tempest. It shouldn’t be there. No ship could survive out there. No lighthouse stands on those waters.

Your navigator, **Liora**, a woman with ink-stained fingers and a voice like dry parchment, stumbles up the deck, her dark braid whipping in the wind. She presses a trembling hand to your arm. *"Captain… that’s not natural. The compass—it’s spinning. No direction holds."*

You follow her gaze. The needle of the compass **whirls wildly**, as if the world itself has lost its bearing. The crew murmurs, some crossing themselves, others clutching talismans of bone and brass. Superstition or not, you’ve sailed long enough to know when the sea is *wrong*.

Then the voice comes.

Not from the deck. Not from the storm.

From **inside your skull**.

*"Turn toward the light."*

It’s not a command. It’s an **invitation**. Smooth. Familiar. Like a memory you’ve forgotten.

Elias hears it too. His face pales. *"Did you—?"*

You don’t answer. Because the light **pulses again**, brighter this time, and the storm *parts* for just a breath—a tunnel of calm in the chaos, leading straight toward it.

The crew is watching you. Waiting.

Do you:
- **Order the helm hard to starboard**, into the storm’s teeth, trusting the *Marlin*’s strength to ride the waves? (Risk the reef. Risk the crew. But at least it’s a known death.)
- **Steer toward the light**, into the unnatural calm? (What waits there? Salvation? A trap? The voice in your head *wants* you to choose this.)
- **Give the order to abandon ship**, lowering the longboats before the *Marlin* breaks apart? (Some may survive. But the sea does not forgive cowards.)
- **Something else?** (The dream is yours. The choice is yours.)
