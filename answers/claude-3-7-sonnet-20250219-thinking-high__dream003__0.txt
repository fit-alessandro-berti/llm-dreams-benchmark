# The Dream of the Mysterious Box

You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and symbols that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them. The engravings glow with a faint blue luminescence that pulses like a heartbeat. When you run your fingers across the surface, the box feels impossibly warm, almost alive.

As you turn it in your hands, the patterns begin to rearrange themselves, forming words in a language you shouldn't understand but somehow do. \,\

Suddenly, you realize your shadow on the wall doesn't match your movements. It raises its hand independently and points to your chest. Looking down, you discover a small key hanging from a chain around your neck that wasn't there before. The key is made of the same material as your memories.

When you bring the key toward the box, it melts like ice cream on a summer day, dripping between your fingers. But rather than falling to the floor, the liquid metal floats upward and forms a perfect keyhole in the air above the box.

You reach up and turn this floating keyhole with your hand. The sound of a thousand locks clicking open echoes around you, though the room you're in has no walls now—just endless stars and cosmic dust.

The box opens, but instead of revealing its contents, it unfolds like origami in reverse, becoming a door standing freely in space. Through it, you can see another version of yourself, waiting, holding a box identical to the one that has just transformed.

Do you step through?
