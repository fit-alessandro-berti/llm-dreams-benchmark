You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you hesitate at first, your heart a tangled knot of suspicion and longing. But their eyes sparkle with an otherworldly warmth, like fireflies trapped in human form, and one of them—a woman with hair like woven moonlight—extends a hand etched with faint, glowing constellations.

You take it, and the world tilts. The city's clamor fades into a soft hum, the skyscrapers blurring into towering trees of glass and vine. Together, you weave through the crowd, not walking but gliding, as if the pavement has turned to whispers. They lead you down an alley that wasn't there moments ago, lined with doors that open into memories: one swings wide to reveal your childhood kitchen, the scent of fresh bread pulling at your chest; another spills laughter from a forgotten birthday party, confetti raining like stars.

"Why me?" you murmur, your voice echoing strangely, as if spoken underwater.

The man with the violin case slung over his shoulder smiles, his teeth glinting like polished keys. "Because we're all lost, darling. We just forget to ask for directions."

Deeper in, the alley opens to a rooftop garden suspended between worlds, where the city sprawls below like a glittering map of veins. You sit among them, sharing stories that taste like honeyed wine—tales of detours that became destinies, of alone-ness that bloomed into belonging. The strangers aren't strangers anymore; they're mirrors, fragments of you scattered and reassembled.

As dawn bleeds pink across the horizon, the woman traces a constellation on your palm. "This is your way," she says. "Follow the North Star in your pocket—it's been there all along."

You wake with a start, the city's hum now just traffic outside your window. But your hand tingles, and in the mirror, you swear you see a faint glow, a map etched in starlight, ready to guide you into the day.
