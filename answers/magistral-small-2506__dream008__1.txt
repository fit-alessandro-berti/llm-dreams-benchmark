feel the weight of the impossible deadline pressing down on you like a ton of bricks. Your heart races, and your mind spirals—how can you possibly finish this in time? The project is massive, with parts you’ve never even touched before, and your boss is standing there, watching, expecting you to just… *begin.*

You take a deep breath, forcing yourself to focus. The first step is always the hardest. You open your laptop, fingers hovering over the keyboard. Maybe if you break it down into tiny, manageable pieces, you can make progress. You start sketching out a rough plan, even if it’s messy. The clock ticks away, but for now, you’re moving.

Your boss nods approvingly—small victories. You realize: impossible only means you’ll have to be clever. You’ll have to ask for help, push limits, maybe even bend a few rules. The dream shifts—suddenly, you’re in the zone, the pressure fueling you instead of crushing you. The impossible becomes just… *hard.*

And then, in the blur of focus, you wake up—sweating, but with a strange, exhilarated smile. Maybe the real world isn’t so different.

*(Or, if you prefer a more surreal twist: the walls of the office start melting, and your boss transforms into a giant, ticking clock. You laugh, because in dreams, even the impossible is just part of the ride.)*
