…make your way through the bustling streets, searching for a clue. The city seems to stretch in every direction, skyscrapers and slender towers jutting into a purplish sky. There are no street signs you can recognize, and even the language on the storefronts is strange and swirling, as though painted in smoke rather than ink.  

You pass people with eyes that reflect the colors of neon lights, each person seeming both familiar and utterly alien. You try to ask for directions, but whenever you open your mouth, it’s as if your voice is swallowed up by the sound of distant traffic and muffled laughter from far-off balconies. The words vanish before they can reach anyone’s ears. You feel time slipping away, so you hurry down a grand boulevard lined with statues of giant, winged figures who look as if they might come alive at any moment. Their faces are stern and silent, each carved from some chalky material that glows faintly in the city’s strange twilight.  

After several blocks, you spot an old man sitting on a low, curved bench beneath a half-finished glass bridge overhead. He’s dressed in layers of clothes that might have once belonged to different eras: a top hat patched with modern symbols, a tattered silk scarf embroidered with tiny mechanical gears, and trousers that look like they were cut from a shimmering, iridescent fabric. He hums softly to himself, as if enjoying a tune only he can hear.  

You approach him, determined to ask for help again, and this time, when you try to speak, your voice emerges in quiet, musical tones. It startles you: you’re not speaking in your own language. Still, the old man understands. He tilts his head, the brim of the top hat casting odd shadows on his weathered face. He smiles, revealing teeth like polished ivory keys. “You’re late,” he says gently, as though the very notion amuses him. “Your meeting is in the Rose Quartz Tower, up on the upper terraces of the city.”  

Rose Quartz Tower. The name rings a bell, but you have no memory of being in this place before. “Where can I find it?” you ask, your voice still singing rather than speaking. The old man raises a crooked finger and points up, past the glass bridge, past the arching wings of the statues, into the hazy skyline where lights flicker in patterns you cannot decipher. “Follow the balconies that grow like flowers,” he says. “They will lead you upward.”  

Time presses on you, and panic sets in. You have less than an hour now. You look around and notice a series of terraces spiraling upward along a distant tower. Each terrace is filled with lush greenery and rose-colored crystals that catch the waning daylight. These must be the balconies he described. If you can just reach them, perhaps you can climb your way up to the Rose Quartz Tower.  

Setting off, you find yourself navigating narrow alleys that twist and turn like a labyrinth. Around every corner, something new awaits: a brass fountain that trickles with water the color of saffron; a whispering gallery where voices echo from distant rooms; a floating lantern that follows you briefly, as if curious, before drifting away. The city, so alien and confusing, seems to push and pull you at once, beckoning you forward and challenging your every step.  

You finally emerge onto a wide plaza paved with hexagonal stones. In the center stands a small platform elevator shaped like a giant lily pad. Several others wait to use it, their eyes glowing, their clothing rippling in nonexistent wind. When it’s your turn to stand upon the lily pad platform, you steady yourself, noticing that the edges are trimmed with rose quartz crystals. Perfect. This must lead you closer to your destination.  

You rise slowly, the city unfolding below like a patterned tapestry. Your heart beats faster as the hour’s end draws near. The lily pad stops at the first terrace, and you step off onto lush, mossy ground. Immediately, you see a slender bridge to the next terrace, and another after that, each one adorned with more rose quartz formations. You hurry across them, noticing that each terrace is filled with dreamlike sights: a greenhouse where butterflies made of stained glass flutter, a cafe where travelers sit drinking liquid rainbows, a library where books arrange themselves and float from shelf to shelf.  

You’re halfway up when you see a sign—a proper, legible sign for the first time—etched into a tall crystal spire: “Rose Quartz Tower: Meeting Halls.” Relief washes over you. You have only minutes left now. You push forward, finally spotting a grand entrance framed by enormous quartz columns. The door is tall and ornate, carved with swirling patterns that match the script you first saw on the city’s storefronts.  

You reach out to open it, your hand trembling slightly. Inside, you expect to find a conference room, perhaps a crowd waiting for you. Instead, you find a tranquil hall lined with mirrors and a single table in the center. On it rests a book bearing your name, its pages fluttering as though caught in a gentle breeze. Your reflection in the mirrors looks calmer than you feel, and as you step forward, a voice—maybe the old man’s, maybe your own—whispers: “You have found your meeting at last.”  

Just then, a soft chime rings out, signaling the hour. You open the book, and inside, you see the notes you were meant to deliver, the message you were always supposed to bring. It’s exactly what you need, and strangely, exactly what you’ve already known. You breathe deeply, realize you are where you need to be, and in that moment, the weight of the city’s mystery and your frantic search lifts. You made it. You are here. And just as you set the book down, you realize you can awaken whenever you choose, taking with you the memory of this dream’s lesson: even in the strangest of worlds, a path can be found if you trust your own voice and keep moving forward.
