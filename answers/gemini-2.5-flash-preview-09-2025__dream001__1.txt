...start to **run**, but the pavement under your feet immediately shifts. It isn’t stone; it’s a vast, intricate mosaic of broken china and shimmering glass, each step echoing like a bell.

The city seems to be constructed entirely of forgotten documentation. The skyscrapers are towering stacks of filing cabinets bound by rusty copper wire, reaching into a sky the color of old parchment. Street signs are useless, written in an elegant, looping script that you somehow understand but cannot translate: *The Boulevard of Missed Opportunities,* *Turn Left at the Corner of Deep Regret.*

A wave of pure, cold panic washes over you. You clutch at your pockets, finding only a crumpled ticket stub and a single, heavy brass gear.

You spot what looks like a subway entrance—a massive, gaping maw under an archway carved from petrified wood. You descend quickly. The air here is thick with the scent of ozone and dust. The subway platform is silent, lit by bare bulbs that flicker in time with your racing heartbeat.

You check the large clock hanging above the tracks. It is not showing the time, but the remaining number of minutes: **37.**

A train arrives, gliding in silently on tracks that are actually twin streams of moving water. The doors hiss open. Inside, the car is empty except for a dozen identical figures wearing tailored suits and featureless, reflective silver masks. They are sitting perfectly still, each holding a briefcase.

You know, without being told, that they are the people you are supposed to meet.

“Excuse me,” you whisper, stepping onto the plush, purple carpet of the train car. “Do you know where this meeting is taking place?”

One figure slowly turns its head. The silver mask reflects your own terrified eyes back at you. When it speaks, the voice is a dry, whispering chorus, like sand shifting on concrete.

***“It is where the contracts are drawn in silence, and the fee is paid in memory.”***

You feel a sharp, terrible pressure behind your eyes. You try to ask another question, but the car lurches violently, and the lights go out.

When the emergency lights click on, the masked figures are gone. The briefcase they held are now piled in the center of the car, forming a precarious pyramid. A small, white envelope rests on top.

You snatch the envelope. Inside, a single index card reads:

**"The destination is not a location, but a speed. Accelerate."**

The remaining time on the platform clock flashes: **12.**

The train begins to move, faster and faster, dissolving the walls around you. You are no longer in a subway car, but flying through a black, starless void. The sound of the wind is deafening, yet everything outside the car is silent.

You look down at your hands. The brass gear you held is now vibrating, and the skin on your palms is peeling away, revealing a luminous, inner scaffolding of wires and pulsing light.

The clock vanishes. The speed becomes intolerable. Just as you feel you are about to atomize, the train slams to a stop.

You tumble out onto a floor made of perfectly polished black obsidian. The air is still, cold, and smells faintly of lemons and ink.

You look up. You are standing in the center of a gigantic, circular room. The walls are lined with millions of open, leather-bound books, their pages fluttering slightly in a nonexistent breeze. There are no doors, no windows, and no clock.

In the very center of the room is a single, worn wooden table, and on that table sits a single, burning candle and an empty chair.

You realize you are precisely on time. The silence is profound.

As you step toward the chair, a new, booming voice—the sound of an avalanche mixed with a librarian clearing his throat—echoes from the walls of fluttering pages:

**“Welcome. You are the subject of the meeting, and we are the committee of your accumulated failures. Please be seated. We have much to discuss regarding your future trajectory.”**

You sit down in the chair, feeling the heavy, unseen gaze of the millions of silent, fluttering pages pressing down on you.

The candle flame leans toward you, and the dream dissolves into the smell of burning wax.
