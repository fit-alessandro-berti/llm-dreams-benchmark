The air tastes like rust and forgotten things. My boots sink into ash-choked earth as I navigate the skeletal remains of a city—buildings like broken teeth against a sky the color of old bruises. No birds. No sirens. Just the *whisper* of dust devils picking over abandoned streets, their spiral dances swirling with memories of rain. My canteen is two sips deep, my jacket patched with scraps of canvas and hope. Some days, the silence is worse than the predators that stalk the ruins—you know the ones. The things that move wrong in the shadows, made of hunger and something older than death.

But here, in the hollow shell of what was once a library, I find it: a single book, miraculously dry under a collapsed ceiling. Not a survival manual. Not a weapon. Just *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland*, its cover soft as moth wings, pages blurred by water stains. Someone loved it. Someone carried it here, knowing it was useless. And in the frontispiece, a child’s handwriting: *"For the next reader—look for the wildflowers."*

*Despite the hardships, you decide to do one thing more.*  
Not scavenge. Not run. Not hide.  

I kneel in the dust, pulling a handful of soil from a crack in the pavement. In my palm, I hold three dandelion seeds—somehow clinging to life, their parachutes white and perfect. The city’s bones groan around me, but for a breath? I’m not alone. Down the street, in the ruins of a playground, a swing set creaks like a ship in ghostly wind. And there. On the rusted chain link, caught like a gift: a single violet, purple as a bruise but glowing in the grey light.  

I press the seeds into the dirt. Not for me. For the earth it remembers. For the one who’ll come after me, who’ll see that violet and know: *someone did something small and brave here*. I uncap my canteen—two drops of water, precious and warm—and let them fall on the seeds. *For the next reader. Look for the wildflowers.*  

The wind shifts. A dust devil curls past me, swirling not just ash, but a single page from a newspaper—a photo of a beach, of people laughing under a sun that hasn’t shone in years. It winds through the ruins like a dancer. And for the first time in forever, I don’t feel afraid of the silence. I feel… present.  

The dream doesn’t end. It just folds into itself, like a book being closed gently. Because the world is broken, but the wildflowers keep trying. And I’m still planting.  

(You open your eyes. Your hand is still curled around nothing. But your palm smells faintly of violet earth.)
