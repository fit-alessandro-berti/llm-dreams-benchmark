…the air pressure drops so suddenly your ears pop, and the sky above fractures like glass. Not clouds, but actual cracks spiderwebbing across the blue, revealing something dark and shimmering underneath. The wind doesn't howl—it *sings*, a low harmonic chord that makes the bark on the trees ripple like water.

You run, but your feet sink into the moss which has somehow turned soft as sponge cake, each step leaving impressions that glow faintly silver. The first drops hit your skin, but they aren't wet. They're warm, heavy as mercury, and where they touch your arms, tiny constellations bloom—actual star patterns swirling across your flesh, mapping unknown galaxies.

You need shelter. There—a doorway. It wasn't there before, carved into the trunk of an ancient oak, framed by roots that have braided themselves into an archway. As lightning splits the sky (and the lightning is white, pure white, leaving afterimages of mathematical equations burned into your vision), you push through.

Inside, the tree is hollow but impossibly vast, a cathedral of wood where the storm's sounds transform into a lullaby. The walls breathe. Outside, the forest is being rewritten—the trees are lifting their roots, walking slowly in a circle dance, their branches weaving together to form a canopy so thick the storm becomes just a distant drumming, like a heartbeat.

You realize you're not hiding from the storm. You're inside it. The tree is the storm's heart, and you are the pulse.
