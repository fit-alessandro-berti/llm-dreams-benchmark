...open your mouth to speak, but instead of words, a long, colorful ribbon begins to pull itself from your lips. You keep pulling and pulling, yard after yard of silk, piling up on the floor like a glossy mountain.

You look down at your notes for help, but the paper has turned into a slice of warm, buttered toast. When you look back up, the audience members are no longer people; they are hundreds of ticking metronomes, all swinging out of sync.

Suddenly, you realize that gravity has shifted sideways. The back wall is now the floor. You gently push off the podium and float slowly toward the ceiling, understanding with perfect dream-logic that the speech was never about talking, but about learning how to swim through the air.
