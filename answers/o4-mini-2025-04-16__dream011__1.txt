…not words at all, but living scenes unfolding on translucent glass plates before you. Each plate hovers an inch above your desk, shifting and refracting the pale fluorescent light.

The first “question” shows a cityscape made of musical notes. Skyscrapers rise as staves, and cars drive along lines of melody. A disembodied voice whispers: “Compose the single note that will remake this metropolis.” You reach out—your fingertip tingles—and suddenly you’re in the street below, surrounded by honking horns and swaying lamp‑posts. You hum, and a single violin string unspools, its tone wrenching the buildings into gentle arches. The city bends, sighs, and rearranges itself into a serene concert hall.

A wisp of smoke drifts from the next plate. Inside you see a labyrinth of mirrors, each reflecting a different version of you: the doctor, the architect, the poet. The prompt floats above it all in cursive flames: “Find the self you haven’t met.” Your pulse races as you step into the maze. Every mirror shows a hand extended or a silent invitation—until one mirror remains dark. You reach forward, palm pressing cool glass, and it ripples. In the reflection you’re smiling, shoulders relaxed, holding a blank page and a pen.

The final plate shatters like ice. In its place, your own exam paper appears: blank, save for three words stamped in molten gold—“Create your future.” You pick up the pen that wasn’t there moments before. The room dissolves, and you write across the empty page, your hand moving with calm certainty.

You wake in your bed, heart still humming. The exam never happened—but the ink on your dream‑page is real, and it reads simply: “Begin.”
