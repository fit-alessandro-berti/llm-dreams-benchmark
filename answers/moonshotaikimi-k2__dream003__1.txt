filaments of light threading through the black-oak grain. Each thread pulses faintly in a rhythm I feel inside my own chest드s though the box is counting iterations of its own heartbeat.

On every face a different pattern resolves, ruins within ruins within ruins, smaller with each unfolding. Some look like cities I half-remember from childhood nightmares; others are as delicate as lace, yet when I squint they rearrange into structural formulae for impossible proteins that splice dream into matter.

I press my palm flat against one glowing fretwork, and the box inhales드ctually inhales. That is when I notice my left wrist has become transparent. Skin, bone, vessels all dissolving into wisps of cobalt vapor that glide toward the grain and are threaded into it like fresh yarn onto a loom.

Panic would make sense, but in a dream panic is just another color. So instead I offer the box more: fingers, wrist, forearm. The vapor respools; the fretwork brightens. Numbers appear on the inside of the lid듫rojected onto the membrane of the air itself at the precise angle where I now dip my shoulder into the corona of light.

They are the instructions. To open the box I must dream backward등alk the spiral counter-clockwise against memory itselfrewind storms and tea kettles, birthdays and wars. The lattice of my forgotten selves clasps hands, forms a chain. Each self fuses to the next as the box finishes drinking me. When only my open eye is left, it floats in the empty space where the box used to be. The lid finally yawns wide and a single strand of hair drifts out든bony, curled at the end, and soft as lullaby.

My eye뇹 last lucid thought: 뉴h. So the key was never missing. It was un-given.
