You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air thickens, smelling of ozone and wet earth. The dappled sunlight vanishes, replaced by a bruised, purple gloom. The birds, moments ago chirping a cheerful chorus, fall silent. A low rumble vibrates through the ground, not quite thunder yet, more like the growl of a sleeping giant.

I quicken my pace, instinctively seeking shelter, but there's *nothing*. No caves, no thickets dense enough to offer protection. Just towering trees, their leaves beginning to thrash wildly in a rising wind. The first fat raindrops begin to fall, splattering on the forest floor like liquid silver. 

Then, it's not rain anymore. It's… feathers.

Thousands, millions of black feathers, swirling down from the canopy, obscuring everything. They aren't falling *with* the wind, they *are* the wind. They whip around me, stinging my face, filling my mouth. I try to shield myself, but it's useless. The forest is being consumed by a blizzard of black feathers.

And within the swirling darkness, I begin to see shapes. Not birds, not exactly. More like… impressions of wings, vast and skeletal, momentarily coalescing and dissolving within the feathery chaos. They’re enormous, impossibly large, and they seem to be *watching* me.

A voice, not spoken but *felt* within my skull, whispers, “The shedding has begun.”

I try to scream, but my throat is choked with feathers. I stumble backwards, tripping over a root, and fall to my knees. Looking up, I see the source of the feathers. 

It’s not the trees. It’s the sky. 

The sky itself is unraveling, peeling away in layers of black, revealing… nothingness. A void, cold and absolute, where the blue should be. And from that void, a single, enormous eye opens, ancient and knowing, and fixes its gaze directly on me. 

The eye doesn’t blink. It doesn’t judge. It simply *is*. And as I stare into its infinite depth, I realize the storm isn’t coming *for* the forest. It’s coming *from* it. The forest *is* the storm. And I am… a single, insignificant feather caught in its wake.

Then, a single feather lands on my outstretched hand. It isn't black. It's shimmering gold, and as I touch it, I feel a strange sense of peace, a surrender to the unraveling. The eye widens, and I feel myself being pulled… not down, but *outward*, into the void.



And then… I wake up. But the feeling of feathers on my skin lingers.
