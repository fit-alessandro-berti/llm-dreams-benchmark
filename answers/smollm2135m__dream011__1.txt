I glance in my corner of the room and see someone who looks like my friend Rachel, looking up just as I've been studying all day. She smiles warmly at me before noticing I'm looking through a stack of study materials scattered across the floor. 

"Excuse me, I was wondering if you might have some questions for me," she says over her shoulder into my earphone, nodding towards the whiteboard where the exam is marked. "Do you think you might be able to help me?"

As Rachel waits to ask my question, I turn my attention back to her face and begin my study session on the computer screen in front of me.
