…follow them through the tide of people as if they’re a gentle current, and the city’s noise starts to rearrange itself into something almost musical.

One of the strangers—an older woman with a scarf the color of wet pavement—walks beside you and asks, casually, “What are you trying to get back to?”

“I don’t know,” you say, and in the dream it feels like the most honest answer you’ve ever given.

They don’t laugh. They nod, as if that’s a real address.

They lead you down a narrow side street you swear wasn’t there a minute ago. The buildings lean closer, the air smells like rain and warm bread, and your footsteps stop echoing—like the city is listening. You pass a shop window full of clocks, all of them ticking out of sync, and your reflection in the glass lags a half-second behind you, blinking slowly as if it’s tired.

The group keeps moving with the calm certainty of people who know the shortcuts. Every few paces, someone points something out: a mural of a door painted on brick; a small tree growing from a crack in the sidewalk; a cat sitting on a mailbox like it owns the street. Little anchors. Proof that you’re still in a world where things can be named.

Then the street opens into a square you’ve never seen before. In the middle is a kiosk lit with soft amber bulbs, and pinned all around it are maps—hundreds of them—some printed, some drawn in pencil, some stitched from fabric. A young man in the group peels one down and unfolds it with the care you’d use for a letter.

The map is blank until you look at it.

As your eyes move, streets ink themselves into existence. Not the city’s streets exactly, but the routes you’ve taken in your life: the hallways you learned to navigate by counting doors, the coffee shop where you once waited too long for someone who never came, the park bench where you made a decision you still don’t talk about. The lines aren’t straight. They loop, double back, vanish, and return. It’s messy and human and unmistakably yours.

You feel your throat tighten. “I didn’t know I was going in circles.”

The woman with the scarf touches the edge of the paper. “Circles are still paths.”

They ask you again, more gently, “What are you trying to get back to?”

You stare at the map until a small mark appears near the bottom—an X so faint it’s almost a bruise. Something in you recognizes it with a sudden, quiet certainty.

“Me,” you whisper. “I think I’m trying to get back to me.”

No one looks surprised. One of them—a teenager with paint on his hands—smiles and reaches into his jacket. He offers you a small object: a key, warm as if it’s been in sunlight. It doesn’t match any key you’ve ever owned, yet your palm closes around it like it belongs there.

“This isn’t for a door in the city,” he says. “It’s for the door you keep walking past.”

They fold the map and place it in your hands, and it’s heavier than paper should be. The square begins to tilt, subtly, like the dream is shifting its weight. The lights blur at the edges. Somewhere a train sighs, or maybe it’s just the city exhaling.

“Wait,” you say. “Where are you taking me?”

“Nowhere you haven’t already been,” the older woman replies. “We’re just walking with you until you can feel the ground again.”

They guide you to the far side of the square where an ordinary-looking door is set into an ordinary-looking wall—no sign, no handle, just a seam, like it was drawn there and forgotten. You would have passed it a hundred times without seeing it.

Your fingers find the keyhole by instinct. You slide the key in, and it turns with a soft click that lands somewhere deep in your chest.

The door opens.

On the other side is not another street, not another room, but a kind of quiet: your own breath, your own heartbeat, the hush that comes right before you remember your name. The air is familiar, like clean sheets or a childhood sweater pulled from a box. There’s a small light—nothing dramatic, just enough to see.

You turn back to thank them.

The square is still there, the kiosk, the maps, the amber bulbs—yet the strangers have melted into the crowd as seamlessly as if they were never separate from it. Only the scarf remains, draped over the kiosk rail like a folded piece of dusk.

Then you notice something else: the city hasn’t gotten smaller, and you haven’t escaped it. It’s simply stopped towering over you. The sounds are still loud, but they no longer drown you out.

You step through the doorway with the map pressed to your chest, and behind you the door swings shut without a slam—more like an eyelid closing. In the dark, the key in your hand grows lighter until it feels like it might float away.

You hold on anyway.

And somewhere, far above the streets and all their rushing, you wake with the lingering sense that if you get lost again, the way back won’t be a place.

It will be a choice you can make.
