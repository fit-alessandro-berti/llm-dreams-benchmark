**The Exam That Wasn’t There**

As you sit down at the desk, the paper in front of you is blank—no questions, no instructions, just a single, faintly glowing word scrawled in the center:

You blink, expecting the page to materialize, but it doesn’t. Instead, the air hums, and the room begins to shift. The walls stretch like fabric, revealing glimpses of other exams you’ve never taken:

- A **math test** where the equations rewrite themselves in real-time, solving *you* instead of the other way around.
- A **history exam** where the answers are living people—your ancestors, your future self, a stranger who knows the secret to time.
- A **philosophy test** with no questions, only a mirror that shows you the face of every version of yourself who failed this exam before.
- A **creative writing prompt** that reads: *"Describe the moment you realized the exam was a metaphor for your life."*

The proctor—a figure with too many eyes—leans in and whispers: *"The questions are always inside you. The only thing standing between you and the answer is the fear of being wrong."*

Then the desk dissolves into a **bed of feathers**, and you wake up.
