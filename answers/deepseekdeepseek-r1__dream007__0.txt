In the midst of your heated argument, the air grows thick and humid, as if charged with the weight of unsaid words. Your friend’s voice echoes strangely, and suddenly the floor beneath you softens, morphing into a spongy marsh. You both stumble backward, but instead of sinking, the ground gives way entirely, plunging you into a dark, rushing river. The current pulls you apart, and for a moment, panic eclipses anger. 

You spot your friend grasping at a jutting rock downstream, their eyes wide with fear. Without thinking, you dive under the churning water, fighting the current to reach them. As your fingers clasp theirs, the river calms, its roar fading into a whisper. The water clears, revealing a glassy surface reflecting the sky above—a twilight streaked with auroras. 

You both climb onto a mossy bank, breathless and drenched. The argument feels distant now, blurred by the surreal ordeal. Your friend laughs, a shaky but genuine sound, and points to a tree nearby where two intertwined roots form a seat. You sit together, the air sweet with the scent of rain-soaked earth. Words come easier here, softer. The disagreement unravels into understanding, the river’s chaos replaced by the quiet certainty that some bonds are deeper than the storms that test them. 

When you wake, the tension lingers only as a memory, but the dream’s lesson remains: even currents of conflict can carve paths to clearer shores.
