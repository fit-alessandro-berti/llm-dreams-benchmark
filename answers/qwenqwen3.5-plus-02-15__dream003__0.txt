...and as my fingers trace the swirling, silver filigree, the metal feels unnervingly warm, pulsing with a rhythm that matches my own heartbeat. The patterns aren't just decoration; they seem to shift when I look at them from the corner of my eye, rearranging themselves into constellations I've never seen but somehow recognize.

Suddenly, the air around the box grows heavy and smells of ozone and old rain. A low hum vibrates through the floorboards, rising in pitch until it becomes a clear, singing tone. The lock doesn't have a keyhole, I realize now. Instead, in the center of the lid, a small depression glows with a soft, azure light.

Instinctively, I stop trying to pry it open. I close my eyes and focus on a memory of a place where I felt completely safe—a sun-drenched meadow from my childhood. As I hold that feeling tightly in my mind, the azure light flares. The intricate patterns on the box spin rapidly, blurring into a single band of white light, and with a sound like a sigh, the lid clicks open on its own.

Inside, there is no gold or jewels. Resting on velvet that seems to be made of midnight sky is a single, ordinary-looking key. But as I reach for it, the key dissolves into stardust that swirls around my hand, whispering a single word: *"Remember."*

The dream shifts then; the room dissolves, and I am standing in that sun-drenched meadow, holding the box, which is now open and empty, realizing the key was never meant to open the box, but to unlock the memory I had just visited.
