…stand at the helm, gripping the wheel tightly as lightning forks across the sky and the waves crash against your ship’s hull. The wind howls, nearly snatching your voice away, but you shout steady orders above the tumult: “Reef the mainsail! Lash everything down!” Your crew scrambles, faces pale but determined, placing their faith in your leadership.

Suddenly, a blinding flash is followed by an eerie calm—too sudden, too complete. The storm’s eye, perhaps? You take a deep breath and scan the horizon. In the silvered light, you spot a shape: an island, shrouded in mist, rising impossibly from the churning sea. It wasn’t on any chart you know.

As the crew looks to you for the next move, you sense this is no ordinary island. The compass spins wildly, and every instinct screams caution, but something deep inside urges you forward. You call out, “Hold course for the island!” The ship surges ahead, almost as if it, too, is drawn by curiosity or fate.

Just as you near the shore, a phantom voice whispers in your ear—a riddle, just out of reach. You steady yourself, preparing for what you will find when you step onto the mysterious island, the crew whispering legends of lost ships and forgotten treasures…

And suddenly, as your boots sink into the mist-covered sand, you realize—**this is only the beginning.**
