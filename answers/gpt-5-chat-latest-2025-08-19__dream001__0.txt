…search your pockets, hoping for some kind of clue. Your hands brush against a crumpled piece of paper. You unfold it—it’s a map, but the streets don’t have names, only glowing lines that shift as you look at them. Some lead into twists that seem to spiral upward like staircases into the sky, while others end abruptly at tall doorways standing alone in the middle of plazas.  

The air feels electric with possibility. People move with strange fluidity around you, their faces vivid but never quite clear, like painted masks. You decide to step toward one of the glowing paths and feel your feet lighten, as though the ground itself is guiding you along.  

Every so often, the map flickers and symbols appear—an hourglass, a key, a circle with three dots. You have an instinct that these are choices. Each could take you closer to your meeting, but in very different ways:  

- **The hourglass** seems to bend time; following it might ensure you arrive on schedule, but perhaps at a cost.  
- **The key** points toward a hidden passage, something secret.  
- **The three-dot circle** glows with a soft warmth, suggesting a path through unexpected encounters.  

The city seems to wait for your decision.  

Would you like to continue by choosing one of these paths, or do you want me to expand on what happens if you keep wandering without choosing?
