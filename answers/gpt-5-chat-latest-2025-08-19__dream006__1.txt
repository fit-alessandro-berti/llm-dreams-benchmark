…speak, but at first, no sound comes out. Instead, the microphone hums gently, almost like it’s breathing with you. Then, as you steady yourself, words tumble forth—not rehearsed, not even consciously chosen, but something deeper, as if the dream itself is speaking through you.  

The audience leans forward, their faces strangely familiar, like a collage of people you’ve known across your life—friends, strangers glimpsed once on the street, teachers, even reflections of yourself at different ages. They smile as though every word confirms something they already understood.  

As you continue, the stage floor grows translucent, and beneath it, you see a shifting current of light, like a river of stars flowing endlessly below. Each sentence you speak causes ripples to move through that river, and new constellations seem to appear in its depths.  

Then you realize: you’re not delivering a speech *to* the audience—you and they are creating it together. Every attentive breath they take feeds your words, and every word you speak shapes the glow beneath your feet.  

You pause, and the silence is complete—not heavy, not anxious—just pure stillness, filled with the sense that everyone, including you, is waiting for one final truth.  

Would you like me to continue this dream toward something uplifting and reassuring, or toward something surreal and mysterious?
