...and, as your fingers trace the swirling grooves, the patterns begin to shift—subtly at first, like ripples across still water. The wood (or is it wood? It feels cool, almost metallic beneath your touch) pulses faintly, as if breathing. A low hum vibrates through your bones, resonating with the rhythm of your own heartbeat.

One symbol—a crescent moon cradling a single star—detaches from the surface and floats upward, hovering just above your palm. As you watch, mesmerized, the other patterns follow: vines unspooling into shimmering tendrils, geometric shapes unfolding like origami birds, constellations blooming into pinpricks of light. They don't scatter; they orbit the box in a slow, silent dance.

Then, the box *sings*.

Not with sound, but with color. A cascade of indigo and gold spills from its seams, washing over your hands, your arms, your face—warm as sunlight, cool as river stones. The lock isn't a mechanism; it's a question. And the answer isn't a key, but a memory.

Suddenly, you remember:  
*This is yours.*  
You made it. Long ago, in another dream, you carved your deepest secret into its heart and sealed it away, fearing its weight. The box wasn't meant to keep something *out*... but to keep something *safe*. *You*.

The floating symbols still, aligning into a single glyph above the latch—a perfect, glowing replica of the scar on your left knee from childhood. The one you got chasing fireflies. The one you’d forgotten until this moment.

The lid sighs open.

Inside, nestled in velvet darker than midnight, rests not a treasure or a weapon… but a single, ordinary dandelion clock. Its seeds tremble, waiting for your breath.  

And you know—*truly know*—that whatever you release now will take root in the waking world.  

You lean closer...  

*(What do you blow?)*
