You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city—towering buildings shimmer with glass and steel, neon lights pulse like stars above, and the air hums with a low, rhythmic buzz. You stand in a circular square surrounded by ancient stone archways overgrown with glowing moss, their carvings shifting subtly as if alive. No one speaks your language, but the city seems to understand you—shadows shift in patterns, street signs glow faintly, and a faint map of invisible paths floats just ahead of you.

You start to scan your surroundings, heart pounding, realizing you have that crucial meeting in just sixty minutes. Panic flutters, but you steady yourself. You close your eyes, breathe deeply, and tune into the city’s rhythm. The wind carries whispers—not words, but feelings: trust, urgency, calm. Following that quiet pull, you follow a silver ribbon of light that winds through alleyways, past silent statues that watch your path, until it leads you into a quiet subway station beneath the square.

The doors slide open to an airlit corridor bathed in soft violet light. You step forward, the moment trailing behind like a heartbeat, knowing clarity will come once you ground yourself in the unknown. The city breathes with you, guiding the way.
