gladly accept their offer, relieved by their warmth. As you walk with them through winding alleyways, the noise of the city quiets, replaced by laughter and gentle conversation. The buildings around you begin to shimmer, their hard edges softened, and colorful lanterns appear overhead, bathing the street in a gentle glow.

Each person in the group tells you a little about themselves—one is an artist, another a musician, another a gardener—and you realize that despite being strangers, their stories weave together like pieces of a familiar melody. The group takes you by a hidden gate, opening onto a lush rooftop garden high above the city. The air up here is clear, filled with the scent of jasmine and mint, and the city’s chaos seems far away.

You watch the sunset together, feeling an unexpected sense of belonging. In this dreamscape, you understand that even when you feel lost, kindness and connection can always be found, often in the most surprising places—reminding you that you are never truly alone.
