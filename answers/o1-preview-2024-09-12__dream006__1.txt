...and you begin to speak, but no sound comes out. A wave of anxiety washes over you as the microphone slips from your hand and rolls across the stage. The audience's faces blur, and the lights dim. Suddenly, the stage floor transforms into a field of blooming flowers swaying gently in the breeze. The crowd fades away, replaced by the serene sounds of nature.

You take a deep breath, feeling the warmth of the sun on your skin. A path appears between the flowers, and you decide to follow it. As you walk, the worries of the speech dissipate. The path leads you to a tranquil lake where the water is so clear you can see the colorful stones at the bottom. You sit by the shore, dipping your feet into the cool water, and feel a profound sense of peace.

A figure approaches from across the lake—it's someone you haven't seen in years but have missed dearly. They smile and wave, and you feel a surge of joy. You realize that this journey wasn't about the speech at all but about reconnecting with what truly matters. Together, you watch as the sun begins to set, painting the sky with hues of orange and purple, knowing that this moment is exactly where you're meant to be.
