Okay, so I'm in this dream, right? And I feel really lost and alone in this big, bustling city. It's like one of those cities you see in movies, with skyscrapers everywhere and people rushing around, but nobody seems to notice me. I'm just standing there, kind of staring at all the buildings, trying to figure out where I am and how I got here.

I don't remember anything; it's like my mind is blank except for this overwhelming sense of confusion and loneliness. The streets are crowded, but it feels like everyone is in their own world, hurrying to get somewhere. I try to ask someone for directions, but when I open my mouth, no words come out. Or maybe they do, but the person just ignores me and keeps walking. It's frustrating.

Then, suddenly, a group of people approaches me. At first, I think they might be more of the same—just strangers who don't care—but as they get closer, I realize they're actually stopping to talk to me. One of them smiles warmly and asks if I'm okay. Another offers help in finding wherever it is I need to go.

I'm surprised; nobody has been this nice to me in a while, at least in my memory. Maybe it's because I'm dreaming, but it feels so real. Their kindness is refreshing, and I start to feel a bit better. Maybe there's hope after all.

So, I try to explain where I need to go, but honestly, I don't even know myself. All I know is that I need to find my way home, wherever that is. The group exchanges glances, perhaps wondering what to do with me, but they don't abandon me. Instead, they decide to take me with them, assuring me that they'll help figure things out.

We start walking together through the city streets. It's still crowded, but with these people by my side, it doesn't feel as intimidating anymore. We pass by markets, cafes, and parks, and somehow, being with this group makes everything seem a little clearer.

One of them suggests that we should go to the central information center; maybe they can help identify who I am and where I belong. It sounds like a plan, so we head in that direction.

Along the way, they try to engage me in conversation, asking about myself, my interests, anything that might jog my memory. I appreciate their efforts, but honestly, nothing comes to mind. It's frustrating, but they're patient and understanding.

As we approach the information center, it becomes more elaborate than I expected. It's like a combination of a library, a police station, and a tourism office all in one. There are people sitting at desks, looking at computers, and assisting others.

The group escorts me inside and explains my situation to the staff. The employees are professional but sympathetic. One of them, a woman with kind eyes, takes charge. She asks me for any identification, but I don't have anything on me. No wallet, no phone, nothing.

She suggests that they can run a scan or something to see if there's any record of me in their system. I agree; anything to find out who I am and where I belong.

They lead me to a private room with a computer and ask me to describe myself as best as I can. I try to recall any details, but it's like my memory is fogged over. I describe my appearance—height, hair color, clothes—but that's about it.

The woman types in the information and starts searching databases. After a few minutes, she leans back and frowns. "I'm not finding anything that matches your description," she says apologetically.

My heart sinks. If they can't find any record of me, then where do I go from here? The group is still by my side, offering support, but even they look concerned now.

Just when I think there's no way out of this maze, the woman's expression changes. She taps on the screen and sits up straight. "Wait a minute," she says. "I'm getting a hit here. There's a report of a missing person who matches your description."

Relief floods through me. Maybe this is my chance to find out who I am.

The woman continues, "According to this, you're [Name], and you live at [Address]. Your family has been looking for you for days. There was an incident—a accident, perhaps?—and you disappeared afterward."

Tears well up in my eyes. So, I do have a life outside of this dream. I have a family who cares about me. The group around me shares in my emotion, some of them patting my back comfortingly.

The information center calls my family, and soon, my loved ones are on their way to pick me up. As we wait, the group sits with me, making sure I'm okay. Their kindness has turned a potentially horrifying experience into something that, while still scary, is manageable.

Finally, my family arrives. They rush over, embracing me tightly, asking if I'm alright, expressing how worried they've been. I look back at the group who helped me; without them, I might still be wandering aimlessly in that city.

I thank them profusely, but they just smile and assure me that anyone would have done the same. Then, they go back to their own lives, disappearing into the crowd.

With my family by my side, we leave the information center and head home. The city doesn't seem so daunting anymore because I'm not alone. And even though parts of my memory are still hazy, I know that I have people who love me and will help me piece everything back together.

As we walk, I can feel the dream starting to fade, but I hold on to the hope and warmth that came from those kind strangers. Maybe in real life, people are more like them—willing to help and care for others without expecting anything in return.

And with that thought, I wake up, feeling a little more optimistic about facing whatever comes my way.

**End of Dream**
