an easel planted in nothing, a palette that seems to have been poured straight out of a rainbow, its paints humming softly like distant music.

Your fingers close around a brush that feels warm and alive. The bristles drink in a color that doesn't have a name, a shimmering tone that tastes like copper and lilac on your tongue and smells faintly of rain. You lift your arm and touch the brush to the canvas.

Instead of leaving a mark, the canvas inhales. Your first stroke is sucked into it with a soft sigh. The white expanse ripples like the surface of a pond, and the stroke you meant to make becomes a thread that writhes and weaves itself into something all its own. Curves bloom into vines, vines into staircases, staircases into rivers of light that cascade off the edge and spill onto the ground at your feet. Everywhere the paint falls, the landscape changes to match it: spheres sprout into trees that bear fruit made of sound, triangles unfurl into origami birds that beat their paper wings and fly away.

Curious, you paint a door. It swings open on hinges that creak like laughter. On the other side is not the world you have been wandering, but a dim room you somehow recognize. There is a bed, and in it a version of you is sleeping, face relaxed, chest rising and falling. You watch your sleeping self for a heartbeat, and the brush in your hand drips a single drop of that impossible color onto the carpet. The drop swells, swallowing the room, swallowing the bed, swallowing you.

You fall through the painting into a sky stitched with constellations made of forgotten childhood drawings. You are weightless, floating, your limbs painting trails behind you like a comet. You realize that this dream canvas has no edges; it stretches out forever, waiting for you to etch your own shapes, to choose what remains in a place where everything shifts.

As you lay down one final stroke, writing your name in looping letters that twist and bloom into flowers, a bell chimes. The colors around you quiver, the flowers close, the sound of the bell becomes the insistent beeping of an alarm clock. The canvas fades to white.

You open your eyes, and for a moment the ceiling above your bed breathes and swirls with all the hues you have just painted. You smile, the dream paint still on your fingertips, and somewhere inside you, that blank canvas still waits, changing with every waking thought.
