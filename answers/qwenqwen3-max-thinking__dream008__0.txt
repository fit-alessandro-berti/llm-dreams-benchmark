...stare at the screen, heart pounding like a trapped bird against your ribs. The project brief glows with impossible demands: "Complete the quantum entanglement stabilizer prototype by 9:00 AM tomorrow. Budget: $3.75 (leftover coffee fund). Resources: None." Your boss, Mr. Haversham, leans against your cubicle wall, his usual tweed suit replaced by a shimmering, iridescent trench coat that seems to drink the fluorescent light. His eyes are the color of static.

"Tick-tock, Alex," he murmurs, but his voice echoes from three directions at once. "The fabric of reality won’t hold much longer without it."

Panic claws up your throat. You haven’t even *had* coffee yet, let alone designed a device that bends spacetime. You fumble for your keyboard, but the keys are made of cold, slick river stones. Your monitor flickers, displaying not code, but a swirling vortex of deadlines dissolving into sand.

Then you notice it: the office itself is wrong. The ceiling tiles ripple like water. Coworkers in adjacent cubicles move in stuttering, time-lagged loops, repeating the same frustrated sigh or keystroke. Janice from accounting walks past carrying a potted fern that’s visibly wilting and regrowing in 3-second cycles. The air smells of ozone and burnt toast.

You’re about to confess utter defeat when you remember the dream-logic rule: *In a dream, the impossible is just another puzzle.* You take a deep breath, the scent of ozone sharpening your focus. Instead of fighting the stone keyboard, you press your palms flat against it. The stones warm, then melt into liquid silver that flows over your fingers, forming a new interface – one that hums with potential.

"Mr. Haversham," you say, your voice surprisingly steady, "the stabilizer isn't built *out there*." You gesture toward the impossible brief. "It’s built *in here*." You tap your temple, then your chest. "It’s about stabilizing* attention.*"

He raises an eyebrow, the static in his eyes flickering into a pattern that looks suspiciously like a satisfied smile. The shimmering trench coat dims to ordinary wool. "Go on," he says, the triple-echo gone, just a tired manager on a Monday morning.

You start typing. Not code, but intentions. *Focus. Clarity. Presence.* Each word appears on the screen not as text, but as a tangible thread of golden light. You weave them together, your anxiety transmuting into concentration. The wilting fern outside your cubicle straightens. Janice’s time-loop smooths into a steady stride. The ceiling tiles settle.

The deadline hasn’t changed. But the *impossibility* has. You realize the project was never about quantum physics—it was about trusting yourself to begin, even when the task seems cosmic. As your fingers fly over the now-normal keyboard, building something real from the dream-stuff, Mr. Haversham nods and melts back into the hallway fog, leaving only the soft chime of a notification:

**Project Accepted. Deadline Adjusted: When It’s Done.**

You wake up just as your real alarm clock rings, the taste of ozone still on your tongue, and a strange, quiet certainty in your bones. Today, you’ll start.
