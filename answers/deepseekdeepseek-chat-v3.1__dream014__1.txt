...and you hesitate for a moment, a flicker of uncertainty in their unfamiliar faces. But their eyes are warm and their smiles genuine, so you nod, a silent surrender of your solitary struggle.

They don't ask for your destination right away. Instead, they form a loose, comfortable circle around you, not trapping you but shielding you from the jostling crowd. One of them, a woman with a voice like rustling leaves, says, "The first thing to know is that you're not lost. You're just on a path you haven't walked before."

They lead you not down the main thoroughfares, but through a hidden network of the city: a narrow alley strung with glowing lanterns, a quiet courtyard where a fountain whispers, a shortcut through a bookstore where the shelves seem to stretch into infinity. As you walk, they each give you a small, seemingly insignificant gift.

The man in the patched jacket hands you a smooth, grey stone. "For grounding," he says. "When the world spins too fast, feel its weight in your palm. Remember this moment, standing still."

The young girl with bright eyes offers you a single, luminous dandelion seed. "For perspective," she whispers. "It holds the map to a thousand possibilities. Just let it go and see where it wants to fly."

Finally, the elderly woman places her hands on your shoulders. She doesn't give you an object, but a feeling: a sudden, warm certainty that flows into your chest. "And this," she says, her voice firm yet kind, "is the way home. You carry it inside. You always have."

You look down at the stone in one hand, the dandelion seed in the other, and the warmth in your heart. When you look up to thank them, you find yourself standing at the door of your own house, on your own familiar street. The group is gone, melted back into the dream. You are no longer lost. You are found, and you were never truly alone. You unclench your fists. In one palm is a single, smooth stone. In the other, nothing at all.
