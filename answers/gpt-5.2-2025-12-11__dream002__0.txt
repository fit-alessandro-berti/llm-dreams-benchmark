You feel a storm approaching and the air turns thick, as if the trees themselves are holding their breath. The birds go silent. Even your footsteps soften, swallowed by moss that wasn’t there a moment ago.

A low rumble rolls through the canopy. Not thunder exactly—more like something vast shifting in its sleep.

Wind threads between the trunks in long, searching fingers. Leaves turn their pale undersides toward you, flashing like thousands of small warnings. The path you were following narrows, then seems to forget itself entirely, dissolving into ferns and shadow. Ahead, a single tree stands apart from the rest: taller, older, its bark silvered as if dusted with ash or moonlight.

Rain begins in slow, deliberate drops. Each one lands with a tiny, crystalline sound, like a distant bell. You lift a hand and feel the water bead on your skin, warm instead of cold. When you look down, one drop clings to your fingertip without falling, reflecting the forest upside down. In that reflection, you see movement behind you.

You turn.

The trees are the same, but the space between them has deepened. The forest looks farther away, as if you’re standing at the edge of a painting. The storm gathers speed, and the wind carries something else now—whispers that don’t form words, only meanings: *hurry*, *remember*, *don’t look too long*.

You push forward toward the silver-barked tree, drawn to it like a landmark in a place where landmarks shouldn’t exist. The closer you get, the more the storm seems to circle rather than strike. Lightning flickers without sound, illuminating the trunk in pale bands. Carved into the bark are markings—spirals, lines, a shape like an eye—fresh and dark, as if cut moments ago.

You press your palm to the carving.

The tree is warm. It pulses once, slow and steady, like a heartbeat passing through wood. The rain pauses in midair. Every drop hangs around you, suspended pearls of water. In the sudden silence, you can hear your own breath, loud and unreal.

Then the carving beneath your hand opens—not splitting the bark, but unfolding it, as if the tree has been waiting to show you what it holds. A thin seam of light appears, widening into a doorway no taller than your shoulder. Inside is not darkness but a soft, humming glow, and the scent that drifts out is impossibly familiar: sun-warmed linen, old books, the comfort of a place you’ve never been.

Behind you, the storm finally breaks. Thunder crashes, close enough to shake your bones. The suspended raindrops shatter and fall all at once. Branches lash the air. Somewhere deeper in the forest, something large moves—too heavy, too slow, not quite chasing, but *approaching* with purpose.

You have the distinct, unarguable feeling that whatever is coming is not meant to find you out in the open.

You duck through the doorway.

The instant you cross the threshold, the noise drops away as if someone closed a door on the world. The storm becomes a distant murmur. You straighten and find yourself standing in a narrow corridor made of living wood, smooth as polished stone. The walls glow faintly from within, lit by veins of amber that pulse in time with the heartbeat you felt.

The corridor curves, and as you follow it, the air changes—cooler, clearer, threaded with a sound like gentle strings being tuned. The floor is springy beneath your feet, and with each step, small motes of light drift up, swirl around your ankles, then dissolve.

At the end of the corridor is a room shaped like the inside of a hollowed tree, but much larger than any tree should be able to contain. In its center floats a basin of water with no bowl beneath it—just water, hovering, perfectly still. Above it hangs a single drop of rain, larger than your fist, trembling with held potential.

Around the basin, objects are arranged in a careful circle: a broken compass, a child’s shoe, a key without a lock, a feather black as ink, a photograph turned face-down. They look like lost things, but not random—like offerings.

You step closer to the basin and look into the hovering water.

Instead of your reflection, you see a place you recognize in the way you recognize a song: a room with a window, late afternoon light, dust floating in gold. Someone is sitting at a table, head bent over something small in their hands. The person’s face is blurred, as if the dream refuses to decide who they are. But you feel the pull in your chest—tender and aching—as if you have been searching for this scene for a long time.

A voice speaks from behind you, quiet but unmistakably present.

“You came before,” it says. “You always do, when the weather changes.”

You turn, but no one is there. The words seem to come from the walls, from the amber veins, from the air itself.

“I don’t remember,” you say, though you’re not sure you meant to speak aloud.

“That’s the bargain,” the voice replies. “The forest keeps you safe. The storm takes the cost.”

The large raindrop above the basin quivers, and a thin thread of water stretches down into the floating pool, joining it without a splash. Ripples spread in perfect circles, and with each ripple, a memory brushes past you—too quick to hold, but sharp enough to feel:

A hand letting go.

A door closing.

Your own voice calling a name you can’t quite hear.

The circle of objects around the basin begins to hum, gently at first, then louder, as if responding to your presence. The broken compass needle twitches. The key vibrates where it rests. The feather lifts a fraction of an inch, floating like it wants to remember flight.

“Choose,” the voice says.

“Choose what?”

“What you take back,” it says. “You can leave with one thing that was lost. A memory. A direction. A name. But if you take something, something else must stay.”

The storm’s distant murmur rises, pressing against the walls like wind against a door. You realize the safety of this place is temporary—an eye in the storm, not an escape from it.

You look around the circle. The broken compass seems to watch you with its useless needle. The key looks heavy, final. The face-down photograph makes your throat tighten. You reach for it, hesitating only a second before flipping it over.

The image shows you standing in this very room, hand on the basin, eyes wide with the same uncertainty you feel now. Beside you stands someone else—close enough that your shoulders touch. Their face is clear in the photograph, but when you try to focus on it, your mind slips away like water through fingers.

“I want to remember them,” you whisper.

The room stills. Even the amber veins pause their pulsing, as if listening.

“So you will,” the voice says, and there is something like sadness in it. “But then you must leave something in exchange. Something you carry without noticing.”

The basin’s surface lifts, forming a small wave that reaches toward you, stopping just short of your fingertips. In it, you see yourself walking into the forest at the beginning of the dream: calm, unguarded, not expecting anything to change.

You understand, suddenly, what the forest is offering you—not a simple memory, but a trade that will alter the shape of you.

The storm outside surges, and through the walls you hear the heavy movement again, closer now. The doorway behind you shudders as if struck by wind or something larger.

Your heart pounds. Your hand hovers over the floating water.

“What do I have to leave?” you ask.

The voice answers so softly you almost miss it:

“Your certainty.”

For a moment you don’t understand. Then you do. You picture waking up and knowing things—who you are, what day it is, what your life looks like. The steady, unquestioned sense of reality that lets you move through the world without falling.

To lose that would be to step into a life where everything might tilt, where every memory might shift like leaves in wind.

But to remember them—whoever they are—feels like recovering a missing bone in your chest.

Outside, the storm roars. The thing in the forest scrapes past the doorway, and the wood groans like it’s being tested.

You make your choice.

You reach into the floating basin. The water is not wet; it’s cool light, silky and alive. As your fingers close, something settles into your palm—warmth, weight, the shape of a memory.

The room exhales. The circle of objects dims, as if a candle has been pinched out.

For a breath, you see them.

A face, clear and close: eyes that crinkle at the corners when they smile, a small scar near the eyebrow, the exact curve of their mouth as they say your name. Their hand in yours, fingers interlaced, an ordinary moment made precious by the way the dream holds it.

Then the edges of the room soften.

The amber veins flicker.

The doorway opens behind you with a sigh, and the storm rushes in like cold air into a warm house.

You stumble back into the forest.

The rain is heavy now, drumming leaves and soaking your hair, but it doesn’t feel hostile. Lightning flashes, and for an instant you see the shape moving among the trees: towering, indistinct, made of shadow and branch and stormcloud—an ancient thing that wears the weather like a cloak. It turns its head toward you, and you feel its attention like pressure on your skin.

You clutch the memory to your chest, though it isn’t an object anymore. It’s inside you, bright and fragile.

The path returns under your feet, appearing like it’s being drawn by the falling rain. You run, not away exactly, but *toward* something—an exit, a waking, a thin place between worlds.

The storm pursues, but with each step the forest becomes lighter, less dense. The trees thin. The air sharpens. You smell asphalt, distant city, morning.

As you break through the last line of trunks, the world shudders like a curtain being pulled aside.

You wake in your bed with your heart racing, sheets tangled around your legs. Rain taps your window—real rain this time, steady and ordinary. The room is dim, early morning light leaking through the blinds.

For a moment, you lie still, afraid to move, afraid the memory will evaporate.

But it’s there.

A name on the tip of your tongue.

A face behind your eyes.

You whisper it into the quiet, and the sound is both familiar and strange—as if you’re saying hello and goodbye at once.

Outside, thunder grumbles far away.

And somewhere deep in your mind, a forest holds its breath, waiting for the next time the weather changes.
