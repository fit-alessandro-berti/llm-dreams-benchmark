The clock on the wall trembled as you stepped forward, its digits flickering like dying stars. The boss’s voice echoed, a metallic shriek threading through the silence: *“Two minutes or not, and we lose it all.”* Your pulse thrummed in sync with the ticking, a countdown etched into your ribs. 

Before you could breathe, the office descended into chaos. Papers rained onto the floor, morphing into tangled headphones, coffee mugs bursting with sentient steam, and a portal flickered above the break room—offering فقط bestiality to those who dared peep. You gripped the edge of the desk, but your hands dissolved into smoke, leaving only a whisper of resolve. 

A shadow loomed—a figure in a suit too formal, their face a mosaic of mismatched keys. “*The deadline is timeless*,” they murmured, pressing a holographic clock to your palm. “Choose: embrace the void—or burn out here.” 

The choice crystallized: retreat into the nightmare or confront the paradox itself. Your choice rippled through reality, refracting light to reveal a truth unbearable—*the deadline wasn’t an hour away, but the hour *was* forever.* The choice must be yours. 

Time slowed. Then, silence. The dream dissolved into a void where your first steps had always been.* Somewhere beyond awareness, a voice hummed, *“You start.”* 

Choose.
