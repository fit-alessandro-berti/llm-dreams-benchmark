completely unfamiliar. The exam paper is filled with abstract symbols, swirling patterns, and riddles that seem to have no connection to anything you've learned. You stare at the first question, which reads: "What is the color of the sound of the ocean?" 

Your heart races as you try to make sense of the instructions. You look around at your classmates, but they are all scribbling answers confidently, as if they understand the meaning behind the questions. You feel a wave of panic wash over you, wondering if everyone else knows something you don't.

You quickly scan the rest of the paper, but the confusion only deepens. One question asks, "If time is a circle, what shape does memory take?" Another reads, "Translate the language of shadows into light." You feel completely disoriented, unable to find any logical approach to tackle these questions.

As you sit frozen in place, you notice something strange: the room around you starts to change. The walls begin to pulse with an eerie glow, and the floor beneath you shifts, turning into a vast, endless desert. The exam paper disappears from your hands, and you find yourself holding a map to a mysterious, unknown land. In the distance, you see a massive door, its outline shimmering with an otherworldly energy.

You know the exam is not over; it's only just begun. But now, it's not just about answering questionsâ€”it's about discovering the path that will lead you to your future.
