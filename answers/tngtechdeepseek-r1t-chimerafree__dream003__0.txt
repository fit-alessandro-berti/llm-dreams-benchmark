You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns etched into its surface—swirling lines, ancient symbols, and constellations you can’t quite name. They pulse faintly, as if alive. 

Driven by curiosity, you trail your fingers along the carvings, and the box hums in response. The patterns shift beneath your touch, rearranging into a glowing rune you instinctively recognize as "open." 

A click sounds. The lid lifts on its own, revealing not a physical object, but a swirling vortex of starlight. It pulls you inward, and suddenly you’re standing in a vast, endless library, shelves stretching into eternity. A whisper echoes: *"What you seek is already within you."* 

You wake with a start, the dream fading—but the certainty lingers.
