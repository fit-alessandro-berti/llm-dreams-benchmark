You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to blend in to survive. You take note of the clothing, language, and customs of the people around you, trying to mimic them as best as you can. The air is thick with the scent of woodsmoke, earth, and distant livestock, a stark contrast to the urban life you're accustomed to. Every sound—hoofbeats, hammers clanging, chatter in an unfamiliar dialect—makes you feel like a foreigner in a strange land.

As you wander through the bustling market, you spot a blacksmith hammering away at a glowing piece of metal. His face is lined with sweat and concentration. You think about approaching him, but a group of townsfolk eye you suspiciously. You realize you stick out, so you quickly duck into a nearby alley to assess your situation.

In your pocket, you find a small pouch of coins from the era—thankfully, you had been carrying it when you time-traveled. You decide to use one to buy a cloak from a nearby vendor to better blend in. Wrapped in the coarse fabric, you feel a bit more at ease, but your stomach growls with hunger. You reluctantly spend another coin on a piece of flatbread and a flask of ale, trying to act as though you've done this a thousand times.

As the day progresses, you overhear snippets of conversation—talk of a nearby lord seeking laborers for his estate. Desperate for a place to stay and food to eat, you consider the offer. But rumors of harsh treatment and low pay swirl in your mind. What if you can offer something more valuable than brute labor? You recall your knowledge of basic medicine, astronomy, or even metallurgy—skills that could set you apart.

You decide to visit the local apothecary, hoping to barter your knowledge for shelter and protection. The shop is filled with the scent of herbs and something faintly acrid. The apothecary looks up from his mortar and pestle, eyeing you warily. You explain your understanding of plants and healing, and after a tense negotiation, he agrees to take you on as an apprentice in exchange for room and board.

As night falls, you sit by the fireplace, listening to the apothecary speak of the world's dangers—plagues, bandits, and the ever-watchful eyes of the Church. You realize that survival here will require more than just knowledge; it will demand wisdom, adaptability, and a keen sense of caution. But for now, you've found a fragile foothold in this unforgiving past. As you drift to sleep, the crackling flames remind you of the beauty and brutality of this ancient world—and the long journey ahead.
