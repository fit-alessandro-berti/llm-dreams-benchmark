find a way to understand and communicate with the people in this era. You notice that everyone is dressed in clothes that seem to be from the 1800s, and they're speaking in a language you don't understand. You decide to start by observing their daily routines and picking up some common phrases. You see a market with people buying and selling goods, so you approach a friendly-looking woman who seems to be selling fruits. You try to mimic the sounds you've heard to ask for the price of an apple. She smiles and responds with a few words, but you don't understand. Just then, a kind-looking man who seems to be a teacher notices your predicament and comes over to help. He speaks to the woman and then turns to you, "Bonjour, je m'appelle Pierre. Comment vous appelez-vous?" You realize he's speaking French, and you're in Paris during the Victorian era. You smile and say, "I'm Alex. Thank you for helping, Pierre." He nods and offers to teach you some basic French phrases.
