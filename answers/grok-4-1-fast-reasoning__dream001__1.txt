You start to panic, your heart racing as you fumble for your phone—only to find it's a glowing seashell that whispers stock market tips in ancient Greek. Frantic, you hail a taxi, but the driver is a giant talking pigeon who insists on payment in shiny buttons. "The meeting's at the Clocktower of Forgotten Dreams!" it coos, veering into a alley that morphs into a river of molten chocolate.

You swim upstream, dodging candy-cane alligators, until you wash up at a towering spire made of stacked hourglasses. The door swings open, and there sits your boss—a wise old owl in a pinstripe suit—sipping tea from a cloud. "You're right on time," it hoots, as the sands of all the hourglasses swirl into a vortex. Suddenly, the city folds like origami, and you tumble through stars...

...waking up in your bed, drenched in sweat, with your alarm blaring. The meeting? It was tomorrow. But now, you're craving chocolate.
