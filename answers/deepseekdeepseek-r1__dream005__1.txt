**Dream Continuation:**

As you weave through the bustling room, the cacophony of laughter and clinking glasses feels distorted, as if underwater. The first group you approach—a cluster of elegantly dressed strangers—falls silent the moment you near. Their heads turn in unison, eyes wide and unblinking. You stammer, “Have you seen…?” but their mouths curl into identical, unsettling smiles before they melt into the crowd like shadows.

The next circle you stumble upon is eerily familiar: a man with your father’s laugh, a woman with your childhood teacher’s voice. Yet when you call out, their faces blur at the edges, and they gesture toward conflicting paths—one pointing left, another right, their fingers elongating unnaturally. The walls around you pulse faintly, breathing in time with your racing heart.

Then, a flicker of recognition—*there they are*, your person, standing beneath a flickering chandelier. Relief floods you until you notice their posture stiffen, their back turning as you sprint forward. The crowd thickens, bodies morphing into mannequin-like figures, cold and unyielding. You push through, but the floor tilts, the ceiling now a starless void. When you finally reach them, they pivot slowly… only to reveal a featureless, porcelain face. 

A distant alarm blares. Your eyes snap open. The echo of the dream lingers—a whisper of a stranger’s name, already dissolving like smoke.
