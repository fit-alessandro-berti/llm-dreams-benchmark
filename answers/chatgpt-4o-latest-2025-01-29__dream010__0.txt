obstacles designed to test your skills, creativity, and determination. The competition takes place in an enormous, surreal arena that constantly shifts and transforms—one moment you’re navigating a labyrinth of floating staircases, the next you’re solving puzzles in a room where gravity bends unpredictably.

In the final challenge, you are led into a vast, glowing library where books float in midair, their pages flipping on their own. A mysterious figure, cloaked in shimmering fabric that reflects the cosmos, approaches and presents you with a single book. 

“This book contains the story of your journey,” the figure says, their voice echoing as if spoken from multiple places at once. “But the last page is unwritten. To win, you must write the ending.”

You take the book and a pen appears in your hand. As you prepare to write, the letters on the pages start rearranging themselves, forming memories of your efforts, your triumphs, and the lessons you’ve learned. You realize that what you write is not just an ending, but a declaration of who you are and who you wish to become.

With a deep breath, you write the final words, pouring all of your passion, ambition, and dreams onto the page. As you finish, the book glows brightly, and the arena dissolves into light. 

When your vision clears, you find yourself standing in the real world—holding a letter that confirms you’ve won the competition. Your dream job is now a reality.

Was it all just a dream… or a vision of what’s to come?
