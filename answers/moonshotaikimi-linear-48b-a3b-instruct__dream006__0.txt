As I step onto the stage, the lights feel warmer than they should—like sunlight filtered through a summer window. The crowd hums with anticipation, their faces glowing softly, almost like candlelight. I open my mouth to speak, but no sound comes—just the rustle of wind through leaves.  

Then I realize the microphones aren’t plugged in. Worse: they’re made of twigs and bark, sprouting like small trees from the podium. The roots tangle around my wrist as I lift them, and the crowd begins to murmur—not with disappointment, but with concern.  

I try again, this time speaking in a language I don’t recognize. The words taste like honey and smoke. The audience nods slowly, as if they understand. A child near the front stands up and hands me a single feather. Behind me, the stage dissolves into a forest path, inviting us all to walk.  

The microphone, now just a hollow bone, guides me forward.
