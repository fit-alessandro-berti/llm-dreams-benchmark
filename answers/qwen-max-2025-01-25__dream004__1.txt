a palette of colors that seem to hum with energy. Each color pulses and shifts, as if alive, whispering secrets only you can hear. The shapes around you—twisting spirals, floating cubes, and undulating waves—seem to encourage you onward.

As you reach for the brush resting against the canvas, it levitates into your hand, warm to the touch. You dip it into a swirling pool of golden light on the palette, and as you do, the world around you holds its breath. When the bristles meet the blank surface, the canvas shivers, rippling like water before solidifying into an image: a door.

The door is unlike any you’ve ever seen. Its frame twists in impossible geometry, shimmering between wood, metal, and something organic, like roots or veins. The knob gleams invitingly, but when you try to paint further details, the brush resists, as though urging you to step through instead.

Curiosity tugs at you, and you glance back at the shifting landscape one last time. It feels alive, watching, waiting. With a deep breath, you place your hand on the painted doorknob. As soon as your fingers make contact, the dream-world explodes into vibrant motion—the colors swirl together into a vortex, pulling you forward.

You tumble through a kaleidoscope of sensations: the taste of rainbows, the sound of sunlight, the feeling of wind made of whispers. And then, suddenly, you land softly in a new realm—a library without walls, where books float endlessly in every direction, their pages flipping by themselves, revealing glimpses of other lives, other dreams.

A figure emerges from the haze, cloaked in silver mist. They hold out a book toward you, its cover blank except for a single word written in letters that shimmer and change: *Yours.*

What will you do next?
