used to seem like thiable and sociable events before, but now everything feels somewhat awkward and forced. As you approach each new group, you greet them with polite smiles, but iach intriducing yourself or asking questions, a strange sense of discomfort washes over you, as if you are wearing an invisible barrier between you and everyone else, and everyone seems to be there with some ulitimate intention, whether its networking or finding their specific match. 

Eventually, you spot the person you know via an ocean of crowd, their back turned as they're deeply engaged in a conversation with a close friend or maybe even stranger. Their laughter ring out, so different from the tension that liners the room. A feeling of envy tightens my throat as you walk towards them, your heart races with anticipation to rekindle the connection you once shared. As you finally make your way to them, your heart begins to race, sweat beads on your temple, and you beacuse overly concious about your trembling hands. But when you reach them and introduce yourself, awkwardness and a mix of emotions flood the scene: joy, nostalgia, confusion, and maybe even a touch of shame. 

You embace, and you swear you can feel the warmth of their embrace, even though it's purely psychological. As you talk again and laugh once more, you are transported back to those simpler times when simply ‘existing’ in the company of people you loved was enough. The room falls silent, as if the whole world is holding its breath, appreciating the authenticity of this interaction. 

With time, you realize that this dream is a metaphor for all the social situations you’ve found yourself in, where connections exist, but they're masked by the artificiality and expectations of modern society. This encounter serves as a reminder to embrace the presence of others without the excessive pretense and to cherish the connections that remain unchanged, a better process that transcends the fleeting whims of passing moments.
