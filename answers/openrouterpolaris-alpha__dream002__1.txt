you sense it before you hear it—pressure dropping, a subtle ringing in your ears.

The light goes strange first.

The greens of the forest deepen into something almost luminous, as if the trees are lit from inside. Shadows sharpen. The air thickens around you, velvet and electric, and the scent of rain arrives all at once, metallic and wild, even though the sky above is still a brittle, overexposed blue between the branches.

Wind lifts, curious at first, threading its fingers through the leaves, combing through your hair. The forest, so peaceful moments ago, turns its head toward the same distant point. Everything listens.

You do, too.

There: a low growl on the horizon, not quite thunder, not quite anything you recognize. It vibrates along your ribs. Birds spiral up out of the canopy, leaving their conversations mid-sentence. The silence that follows is the loudest thing you’ve ever heard.

You step off the path without meaning to.

The light flickers as if someone is slowly dimming the day. The air cools against your skin, beading it with goosebumps. You become aware of your own heartbeat, louder, slower, pulled into sync with that approaching sound.

Another rumble, closer. This time it’s layered—thunder, yes, but also something like a vast door swinging open underwater.

You look up.

The sky is wrong.

Clouds fold in on themselves in spirals, bruised purple at the edges and glowing white-gold at the core, revolving silently. Lightning moves inside them like slow, thoughtful handwriting. When it strikes, it doesn’t reach down: it reaches sideways, connecting one cloud to another, stitching a pattern across the sky that you almost recognize and then lose.

The first drop of rain touches your hand.

It is warm. It glows.

You stare. The droplet dims, then sinks into your skin without a trace, leaving behind a faint tingle that shoots up your arm into your chest. You inhale sharply; the forest inhales with you. The trees lean closer, their leaves trembling, waiting.

More drops fall.

They don’t spatter. They hang in the air for a breath, perfectly round, catching the last of the ordinary light, each one holding a tiny reflection of your face, the trees, the impossible sky. Then, soundlessly, they burst into fine silver threads that drift down like strands of spider silk, wrapping around branches, brushing your cheeks, clinging to your eyelashes until your vision fills with tiny, shifting rainbows.

You blink, and the world opens.

You can hear the sap moving in the trunks. You can feel the roots pulsing under the soil like a second, slower heart. Each gust of wind arrives as a thought: “Storm,” the leaves say, but they do not mean danger. They mean change.

Thunder cracks. But instead of shattering the air, it articulates. The next roll of it shapes itself into a word that somehow booms directly inside your head:

“COME.”

The path you left has vanished. In its place, the forest floor has darkened to a rich, impossible blue, soft as moss but faintly luminous, like the back of a sleeping animal. You place your foot on it and feel it accept your weight, then gently lift, as if carrying you forward.

You move without quite choosing to.

Ahead, the trees part into a tall, natural corridor, branches arching overhead to form a living ribcage of leaves and light. At the far end pulses a dull, steady glow, like a heartbeat behind a curtain.

The storm gathers above, its voice now a continuous low hum peppered with flares of white lightning that cast the woods into negative image—white trees, black sky, your own hands outlined in silver fire. You notice lines of that same silver tracing up your arms, delicate and branching, like frost or like roots, humming faintly in time with the thunder.

You should be afraid, you think.

You’re not.

As you walk, the rain-things keep falling: not water now, but fragments of memory that aren’t quite yours. With each one that brushes your skin you glimpse something:

- A mountain splitting open to reveal a sky full of oceans.
- A child walking on the underside of a rainbow, laughing.
- A city made of glass trees ringing wind-chimes in a violet dusk.

These flash through your mind and dissolve, leaving behind only an expanding sense that this storm has been traveling a long time to find you.

The humming grows louder. The corridor opens into a clearing.

In the center of the clearing stands a colossal tree, older than language. Its trunk is so wide you could walk for minutes and not see all of it; its bark glows faintly, etched with swirling patterns that echo the lightning’s script. Its branches disappear into the storm, or perhaps the storm is pouring down out of it.

At the base of the tree is not earth but a smooth, dark mirror of water, still despite the falling glow-rain. Every drop that would touch it slows, shivers, and is absorbed without a ripple, as if the surface is thinking about letting it in.

The next thunder speaks again, closer, almost gentle:

“CHOOSE.”

You look down.

In the water, your reflection is wrong in a way that makes your heart trip. Your face is yours, but your eyes hold spinning galaxies of cloud and lightning. Your skin is threaded with those silver root-patterns, brighter now, connecting your fingertips to your heart, your heart to the ground, the ground to the immense tree.

Around your reflected feet, images bloom like ink:

- A door made of rain, waiting to be stepped through.
- A staircase that climbs into a stormlit sky.
- A key of white lightning hanging just above your open hand.

The wind circles you slowly, like a question.

“Choose what?” you ask, though your voice doesn’t quite leave your mouth; it appears in the air as a small ring of glowing breath that the storm reads.

For the first time, the clouds break directly above you. A shaft of pale, otherworldly light falls, flawlessly round, enclosing you, the mirror-water, the base of the great tree. Inside this circle, the rain stops. Time seems to hold its breath.

And then you understand—not with logic, but with the quiet, undeniable certainty that dreams sometimes give you:

The storm is not here to tear the forest apart.

It is here to trade.

You can keep walking as you are and wake as you were, letting the storm pass overhead, its secrets sliding away into another world.

Or you can step forward into the mirror-water, accept what it offers: to carry its language, its memory, its electricity back with you. To never again mistake the change in the air for mere weather. To always feel the deep, pulsing network of things, alive and listening.

The forest waits. The tree waits. The storm, for all its vastness, waits.

You lift one foot.

The silver on your skin brightens.

You realize—suddenly, lucidly—that you are dreaming, and that knowing this does not give you control, only clarity. The choice is still real.

Behind you, the peaceful path of the ordinary closes like a book.

Above you, the sky whispers in a dozen overlapping voices, some that sound like your own:

“Well?”

You breathe in the charged air, look into your too-bright reflection, and—
