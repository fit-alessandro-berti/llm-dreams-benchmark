You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you...

**[Dream continues...]**

Your heart races as you look around the office, feeling the weight of the task before you. The project is more complex than anything you've ever tackled, and the timeline is tighter than a heartbeat. You glance at the clock—2:15 AM. The deadline is in 45 minutes.

You pull out your phone, but it's already dead. No way to call someone or check emails. You take a deep breath, then open your laptop. A single screen flickers on, and you’re staring at a document titled *Project Horizon: Final Report – Urgent Revision Required*.

The first paragraph is already written. It’s a disaster. You’ve got two hours to fix it before the boss arrives. You’re sweating, your hands shaking, and your mind racing with ideas—what if you can’t finish? What if you fail?

You grab a pen and start writing. The words come slowly, but they flow. You add a new section, a table of contents, and a timeline. You’re halfway through when your phone buzzes—**no signal**. You’re alone in the office, surrounded by silence, and the clock ticks louder than ever.

You push through, pushing yourself harder. You log in to Slack, but there’s no one there. You search for help, but nothing comes up. You’re stuck.

Then, just as the clock hits 3:00 AM, you realize something. You’ve been working on this project for three hours straight. You’ve been ignoring your own needs—your sleep, your meals, your rest. Now, as the deadline approaches, you’re exhausted, but you’re still working.

You close your laptop, collapse onto your chair, and let the weight of the dream settle over you. You feel defeated, but also strangely calm. You’ve done it—*you’ve made it through*. And as the dream fades, you wake up, still breathing hard, but with a quiet sense of accomplishment.
