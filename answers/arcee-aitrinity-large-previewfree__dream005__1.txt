As you navigate through the bustling crowd, you notice that each group seems to be engaged in lively conversations, their laughter and chatter filling the air. You catch snippets of discussions about art, travel, and shared memories, but none of it feels familiar. You weave through the clusters of people, occasionally bumping into someone or getting caught in a brief, awkward exchange of pleasantries.

One group catches your eye—a circle of people playing a strange, dreamlike game involving glowing orbs that float and change colors. Intrigued, you pause to watch, but the rules seem to shift every few moments, making it impossible to understand. You smile politely and move on, feeling a bit disoriented.

Further ahead, you spot a group of people dancing to music that seems to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. The rhythm is infectious, and for a moment, you consider joining them, but the fear of not knowing the steps holds you back. You continue your search, feeling a growing sense of urgency to find the one person you know.

As you round a corner, you find yourself in a quieter part of the gathering—a cozy nook with plush chairs and soft lighting. There, sitting alone and reading a book, is the person you’ve been looking for. Relief washes over you as you approach them, and they look up with a warm smile, as if they’ve been expecting you all along. The dream shifts, and the chaos of the gathering fades into the background, leaving you with a sense of connection and belonging.
