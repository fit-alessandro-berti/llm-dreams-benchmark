…open your mouth, but instead of words, a single shimmering note escapes—clear, bell‑like, impossible to identify as any letter or syllable. It hovers in mid‑air, a bead of sound, then bursts into a slow‑moving mist that rolls across the audience.  

No one seems alarmed; they simply lean forward as though waiting for whatever will come next. You try again. This time a whole chord pours out, iridescent and fluid, curling around the light rigs like ribbons. Where the music touches, objects and people begin to change: programs in spectators’ hands blossom into white moths, the heavy velvet curtains dissolve into hanging gardens of wisteria, and the ceiling ripples open to reveal a sky so deep it swallows the stars that used to live there.

A hush settles. You realize the silence is asking for meaning, so you attempt actual speech. “Good evening—” But the phrase splinters mid‑air, each syllable turning into a flock of tiny, luminous commas that flutter away, punctuating nothing.

You feel a moment of panic—how can you give a speech when your words refuse to behave? Then you notice the audience’s eyes: they glow like quiet moons, patient, trusting. You sense they do not need sentences; they need the dream itself.

So you change your tactic. You think of courage, and a warm amber light pours from your chest, spilling across the stage. You think of questions left unanswered, and translucent question marks rise like jellyfish, drifting through the rafters. You think of hope, and green shoots sprout from the floorboards, twining around your ankles before racing toward the back rows, blooming into wildflowers beneath every seat.

The crowd begins to respond not with applause but with transformations of their own. A woman in the front row exhales a cloud of paper cranes that take flight toward the open ceiling. A child further back releases a laughter so bright it fractures into prisms, scattering color over everyone. Together, speaker and audience weave a silent, symphonic dialogue of images and feelings.

At last you sense a natural cadence, a place where an ending might live. You gather everything—notes, commas, light, flowers, cranes—and draw it inward. It condenses into a single phrase that only you can hear: You already know how to speak.

You bow. The lights dim. The dream folds like origami around you, creasing into darkness. Just before it closes, you glimpse the audience rising, not to clap, but to lift off the ground, buoyed by the very hush that filled the hall.

And as the final edge of the dream seals itself, you wake with the unmistakable sensation that somewhere, in a theater made of night, the speech continues—wordless, weightless, endlessly understood.
