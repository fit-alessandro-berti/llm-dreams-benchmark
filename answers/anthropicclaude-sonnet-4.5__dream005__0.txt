...each group seems to be speaking in a language that shifts just as you begin to understand it. The rooms keep multiplying—every doorway you pass through leads not to the next room, but to three more rooms, each filled with faces that feel almost familiar but remain just out of recognition.

Your one friend—you can picture them clearly, can almost remember their name—is always just ahead. You catch glimpses: the back of their head disappearing around a corner, their laugh echoing from an adjacent room, a hand waving from across a crowded space before being swallowed by the crowd.

The gathering seems to be celebrating something important, though no one will tell you what. People keep congratulating you, clapping you on the shoulder, handing you drinks in glasses that change shape when you try to hold them. The music is beautiful but comes from no identifiable source, and it makes you feel both deeply nostalgic and anxious about something you've forgotten to do.

You realize you're supposed to give a speech. Everyone is suddenly looking at you expectantly. You stand before a microphone that grows taller as you approach it. You open your mouth to speak, and that's when you notice—your friend is finally right there in the front row, smiling encouragingly. 

But when you try to call out to them, your voice comes out as...

*What happens next in your dream?*
