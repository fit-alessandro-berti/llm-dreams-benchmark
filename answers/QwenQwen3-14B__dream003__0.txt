You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and **a labyrinth of interwoven symbols that seem to shift when you blink—constellations, ancient runes, and fractal geometries all fused into a single, pulsating design. The wood of the box feels warm, almost alive, and faint whispers echo from its surface, murmuring in a language you almost understand.**  

Suddenly, the ground beneath you dissolves into a void of starlight, and you’re standing in a vast, floating library where books drift like fireflies. The box hovers above your chest, its patterns now aligning with the constellations overhead. A shadowy figure materializes—a version of yourself, older, wearier, holding a key made of smoke. They gesture toward the box, their lips moving silently.  

When you reach out, the symbols on the box flare brightly, and the air hums with a low, resonant tone. The key materializes in your hand, but as you turn it, the box doesn’t open. Instead, it **splits open like a blooming flower, revealing not treasure, but a mirror. Your reflection stares back, but it’s not you—it’s a stranger, eyes glowing with the same shifting patterns.**  

The dream fractures. You wake, clutching a key-shaped scar on your palm, and the hum of the box lingers in your bones.
