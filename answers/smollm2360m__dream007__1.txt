I awoke before reaching the same spot where the arguments were brewing last night, but my senses told me something was wrong. It felt strange without the context built into dream analysis. I stared blankly, searching for my friend's gaze – she's always here somewhere beneath all the noise in my waking life. We're both 27 and have just been thrown back from a heated debate about climate change policy at a bar. Can you picture this?

My body doesn't feel right; I've always felt out of place when our conversations turn into long, pointless rants. Our voices mix up – some in the same words, sometimes entirely different meanings – but they're not meant to be understood by anyone around us. My mind's racing with "what ifs" about my friend trying that one time and how she got so passionate about an issue that nobody wants to argue about anymore after 10 years of ignoring climate change. 

I've noticed in all the days since our last standoff that I seem more withdrawn – distant, unresponsive to everything around me. It's as if my brain's trying to keep a lid on it, but when the words start coming out loud again, my mind will be flooded with these mixed emotions: relief, betrayal, anger... it feels like I'm losing myself entirely in this debate over climate change. If only our friend could see how much we're arguing about everything else – our priorities, our goals, even life itself – but nothing seems to matter anymore as a result of the disagreement we've locked ourselves into about something so important.
