You think to yourself: "This challenge was tougher than I expected." You try harder to impress the judges and maintain focus on your goals. After much hard work, it becomes clear that your progress has been a lot more impressive compared to those other contestants. But what's making things even more challenging is the fear of not being able to get this dream job if you don't get through these final challenges now. Then there's the competition between yourself and one other person who seems quite capable as well. There may be more than a few doubters watching your progress that night, feeling the pressure of their own dreams slipping further into obscurity.

Despite this daunting situation, you press on with determination, knowing how hard it has been to get this far to reach out for your dream job. After many trials and tribulations (of both kinds!), you successfully overcome one last hurdle which puts you at number two instead of first place. The crowd gasps in surprise but you remain calm and determined throughout your journey towards achieving your dreams.

With a newfound sense of confidence, the judges announce that you've been awarded the top prize - the dream job! You celebrate with all the people who have supported you along the way...
