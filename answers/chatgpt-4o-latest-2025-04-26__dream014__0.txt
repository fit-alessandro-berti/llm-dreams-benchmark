gladly accept, their smiles like small lighthouses cutting through your fog of confusion. They lead you through winding alleys and sun-drenched streets, where music seems to pour from the walls and every window is framed with colorful flowers. As you walk, they tell you stories â€” strange, beautiful tales that seem both ancient and brand-new.

Eventually, you reach a hidden courtyard glowing under strings of golden lights. In the center stands a magnificent tree with silver leaves that hum softly in the breeze. One of the strangers â€” an old woman with laughter etched into her face â€” places a hand on your shoulder and says, *"You were never lost. You were just on your way to something new."*

And in that moment, the loneliness lifts, and you realize the city isnâ€™t a maze anymore â€” itâ€™s a map, and somehow, you already know the way.

Would you like me to keep going? ðŸŒ™
