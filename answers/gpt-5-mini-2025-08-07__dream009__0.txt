You wake up to straw in your hair and a roof of rough-hewn beams above you. The air smells of wood smoke and damp wool; daylight slants in through a shutter and the light is softer, thinner than any sun you remember. You reach for the panel of glass you always keep by your bed—there is no glass, just a wooden peg and a patch of sky. Outside, a wagon clops past on rutted mud, pulled by a horse that snorts and stamps. Voices carry in an old cadence you almost understand and almost do not.

You sit up and pat your pockets. Your phone is gone, of course—nothing hums or chirps. Whatever hour it is, it will be counted by bells and by the sun, not by a device. Your modern life feels like a costume folded into your back pocket, unfamiliar and impossible to wear here.

As you explore the village, every step is a small unlearning. The baker’s oven is a stone mouth that eats whole loaves; the children run with bare feet like small, dark planets. No fluorescent lights, no cars, no electricity—and no map to orient you. People look at your clothes, at your shoes, at the way your hair is cut. The curiosity in their eyes is bright but wary. A woman with flour on her hands asks where you’re from; you answer with a year that means nothing. She laughs kindly and tells you to come see the town crier, who will decide if you are a traveler or a trouble.

In the market square, a man points to the sky and the word "comet" passes through the crowd like a current. They speak of a bright light that passed over three nights ago, of a stone on the hill that has begun to glow. You remember the dream you fell from—images of a ring of standing stones and a cold, low hum. Something in you tenses: perhaps the reason you’re here isn’t random.

You realize, with the same small, sharp clarity you get when you forget your keys at home, that you need to be useful. A stranger here is not just lost; a stranger is suspicious. To move freely, to learn, to reach that hill the villagers whisper about, you have to trade something concrete for shelter and passage. You cannot buy your way with credit or with language that names unfamiliar technology. What you can offer is knowledge, work, skill.

You remember the physics lecture you slept through in college and the odd DIY videos you consumed at three in the morning—how to temper steel, how to filter water with sand and charcoal, how to stitch a split leather sole. You remember the street-smarts of urban living too: which people to trust, how to read a crowd, how to charm information out of someone with a question about their dog. This is not the future. It is a different ledger of worth. So you begin to trade.

You help the wheelwright by holding the rim steady as a hot nail is driven. You show the healer a simple way to clean a wound that reduces infection. You tell the shepherd about rotating pasture and watch his face change from suspicion to hunger; the notion that grass can be managed to last the winter is like a prophecy to him. Each small success buys you a bed for the night, a bowl of stew, and—importantly—the right to ask questions without eyes narrowing into knives.

At dusk a boy named Tomas points you toward the hill. "Stone of the lights," he whispers, eyes wide. "Old wives say it speaks." The town crier tells you to be careful—some things, he says, are for gods or fools. You steel yourself against his tone. You need the hill. Whether it will send you back or keep you here, you cannot yet tell; but the hum in your memory pushes you forward like a tide you want to surf.

On the path up the hill, you are acutely aware of your modern habits: you want to check your location on a device, to text a friend that you’re in a different era and see if they answer, to look up this place on a map. There is none of that. The sky here is astonishingly clear; the Milky Way is a smear of sugar, and the constellations are the same old names with different stories told around them. You have no instruments but your eyes and an idea: the stars are older than your city’s myths, and they’ve guided sailors and shepherds for millennia.

At the ring of stones, the air is cool and metallic. The stones are etched with patterns that make no sense and, as you step closer, you realize they line up with the tide of stars overhead. The hum rises and you remember the one thing you can do that neither the villagers nor the stones expect: you can think about systems. Not just the symbolic, but the physical. You start arranging small tinder, you build a tiny controlled fire to mark a point, and you trace with a stick the angle of a stone toward Polaris—algorithm without electricity. You set a simple sundial from a shard of pottery. It is ancient, practical, clumsy, and human.

You realize you need to translate: the language of your former life into this one, the language of the stones into the language of people. If time has thrown you here like a flung stone, the only way to be moved again is to become part of the pattern—to give something that alters the current enough to pull you back. So you tell Tomas about the way shadow and light change when an object crosses a path, about how a watch is a tiny map of movement, about how people can control fire and water and crop in different rhythms. In exchange, they teach you to listen to the wind the way farmers have listened for centuries, and to feel the world with two hands instead of a screen.

Night swallows the horizon. The comet—if it was ever a comet—shivers in memory like a half-remembered melody. Standing in a circle of stones with soot on your fingers and a child's torch in hand, you understand the smallness and the power of what you can offer: not modern miracles, but practical, human skills paired with a willingness to be useful. You need to earn not only your way home but a right to be believed.

You climb the hill at dawn; you hold your breath, and the day takes a breath with you. Whether the portal opens or the world simply continues without you, you have taken the first steps: you have traded bewilderment for action, fear for competence. You needed to stop being an observer of your own life and start being a participant in someone else’s.

When the first light bends on a stone and the hum deepens into a vibration that feels like a remembered song, you close your eyes and step into the space between breaths. The dream bends, and you are no longer sure if you will return. But you are ready—because you learned how to move without technology, how to speak with your hands and your hands alone, how to make yourself useful in a world that measures value in different currencies.
