...and you feel an immediate weight lift from your shoulders, as if gravity itself has softened. You take their hands, and as you begin to walk, the harsh neon lights of the city bleed into soft, golden hues. The noise of traffic dissolves into the sound of wind through trees, though you are still on pavement.

They lead you not to a map coordinate, but to a small, wooden door standing freely in the middle of a bustling intersection. Cars pass through it like ghosts. When you turn to thank them, their faces are blurred, yet you know they are smiling. You open the door and step through into a quiet room filled with the smell of old books and rain. As you sit down, the dream fades like mist under the morning sun, leaving you waking with a lingering sense of safety, as if you were never truly lost at all.
