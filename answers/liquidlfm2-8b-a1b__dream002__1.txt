You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically—the sky darkens like ink, and a low, resonant hum begins to vibrate through the air. The gentle rustle of leaves shifts into a wild wind, whipping the trees into a frenzied dance. Rain begins not as droplets, but as silver shards slicing through the canopy, each one glowing faintly with an eerie inner light. 

A sudden flash of lightning reveals the twisted forest beyond—trees deformed by malice, their branches reaching like grasping fingers, glowing faintly with ancient inky runes. The air grows colder, charged with an electric awe. A deep, resonant voice—neither animal nor human—echoes through the storm, speaking in your mind: *“The veil thins. Truth exceeds your waking eyes.”* 

You step forward, heart pounding, and notice the ground beneath your feet pulsing with faint, bioluminescent veins—roots that pulse and shift, as if the earth itself remembers a forgotten story. The storm isn’t destructive; it’s revealing—uncovering hidden paths, forgotten memories, and the raw bones of what lies beneath the forest’s surface. 

In that moment, you understand: the dream isn’t chaos. It’s awakening. And you are where the truth begins to bleed into the waking world.
