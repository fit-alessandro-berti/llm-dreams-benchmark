adapt quickly to survive. The air smells earthy, and the sounds of nature surround you—birds chirping, leaves rustling in the wind, and water trickling nearby. You're dressed in simple, unfamiliar clothing made from rough fabric, and there’s not a single trace of modern technology anywhere.

As you take stock of your situation, you realize you need to **find shelter** before nightfall. The sun is already beginning its descent, casting long shadows across the landscape. You spot a dense forest ahead, but also notice smoke rising faintly in the distance—a sign of possible human habitation or danger.

You decide to investigate the smoke first, hoping it might lead you to friendly people who can help explain this strange new world. As you approach cautiously, you hear voices speaking an unfamiliar language. They sound cheerful, laughing and singing as they work around what appears to be a small village surrounded by fields of crops.

Before stepping into view, you pause to consider how best to present yourself. Your clothes are plain enough that you blend in somewhat, but you have no idea about their customs or whether outsiders are welcomed here. Still, you know you’ll need food, water, and perhaps guidance if you’re going to figure out how—or why—you’ve ended up in this time.

Just then, a child runs out from the edge of the village, chasing after a stray goat. Their eyes meet yours for a brief moment, wide with curiosity. Before you can react, they shout something back toward the village, alerting others to your presence. A group of villagers begins walking toward you, some carrying tools that could double as weapons.

Now, you must decide:  
- Do you try to communicate through gestures and hope they understand?  
- Attempt to flee and hide until you can come up with a better plan?  
- Or stand your ground and trust that these people will see you mean no harm?

What do you do?
