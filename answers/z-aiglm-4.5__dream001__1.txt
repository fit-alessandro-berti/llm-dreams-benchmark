Your heart hammers against your ribs as the unfamiliar city towers loom over you, their glass and steel surfaces shimmering with an unnerving, liquid light. The streets below pulse with a chaotic river of faceless people moving at impossible speeds, their footsteps creating a low, humming thrum that vibrates through the pavement and up your legs. *One hour.* The thought is a hot coal in your mind.

You start running, but it’s like wading through thick, invisible syrup. The crowd flows *around* you, not jostling, but creating silent wake-lanes that immediately close behind. You try to ask for directions, turning to a passerby whose face is a smooth, featureless oval. "Meeting!" you gasp. They only point silently down a narrow alleyway that wasn’t there a second ago, then dissolve into mist.

The alley twists impossibly, folding back on itself. Doors line the walls, each identical and unmarked. You grab a handle; it’s cold and morphs like liquid metal, slipping through your grasp. Panic chills you. *Where? WHERE?* The city seems to mock you; buildings shift subtly, heights change, streets you just passed vanish. Overhead, the sky swirls in abstract patterns of cobalt and ochre.

Suddenly, a pigeon lands on your shoulder. Instead of cooing, it speaks in the clipped, emotionless tone of an automated receptionist: **"The apex of convergence is designated by the four-seasons arbiter. Commence protocol: Ascend the inverted helix. Form 37-B must be presented at the zenith."** Then it pecks your ear – hard – and flies off, leaving behind a single, iridescent feather that crumbles to dust when you touch it.

*Four-seasons arbiter? Inverted helix?* The words feel heavy, nonsensical, yet impossibly urgent. You spot it then: impossibly high above, woven between the skyscrapers, a colossal staircase spiraling *downwards* from the sky. People (or things that look vaguely like people) are walking *up* the descending steps, gravity-defying. Your legs ache, but you sprint towards its base.

The climb is agony. Each step requires monumental effort, your muscles screaming. The air grows thinner, colder, smelling of ozone and wet stone. Below, the city becomes a dizzying kaleidoscope of impossible geometry. As you reach the dizzying height where the staircase seems to terminate in thin air, you see the "arbiter": a giant tree growing *out* of the void, its branches heavy with four distinct types of foliage – spring blossoms, summer leaves, autumn fire, and winter frost, all simultaneously. Beneath it, a single, old-fashioned elevator door marked only with a stylized clock face.

You slam on the call button. It chimes softly. The doors slide open… revealing not an elevator car, but the exact same cafe you woke up in this morning, impossibly contained within the doorway. The smell of coffee hits you. The clock on the wall reads *7:59 AM*. Your meeting is at 9:00. *You’re late.*

The pigeon reappears on the cafe counter. "Form 37-B," it states flatly, tapping a blank piece of paper with its beak. Your alarm clock buzzes, sharp and insistent, blurring the impossible cafe, the inverted staircase, and the four-seasons tree into a jumble of fading light and throbbing panic. The dream dissolves with the echo of that final, judgmental buzz.
