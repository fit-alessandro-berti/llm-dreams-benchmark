You feel a storm approaching and quicken your pace, the once-gentle rustle of leaves now a frantic whisper urging you onward. Dark clouds boil overhead like ink spilling across the sky, and the air thickens with the scent of rain and something sharper—ozone, or perhaps the breath of forgotten gods. Thunder rumbles in your chest, not from above but from within, vibrating your ribs like a drum calling you to dance.

You duck under a canopy of ancient oaks, their branches twisting into impossible shapes, fingers reaching out to snag your sleeve. But it's too late; the first fat drops fall, not water but silver coins that clink against the forest floor, piling up in shimmering stacks. You scoop one up, and it dissolves in your palm into a map—a glowing constellation of paths leading nowhere and everywhere.

The wind howls, whipping your hair into a crown of wild feathers, and lightning cracks the sky open, revealing not thunderheads but a vast, upside-down city suspended in the clouds: spires of crystal, streets of woven starlight, and figures leaping between rooftops like shadows with wings. One of them spots you—a silhouette with eyes like distant galaxies—and dives, plummeting straight toward the treetops.

Heart pounding, you run, but the ground shifts beneath your feet, roots uncoiling like serpents to form a staircase spiraling upward. You climb, coins cascading around you in a metallic hail, until you burst through the canopy into the storm's heart. The diver lands before you, not crashing but alighting gracefully: a fox with fur of midnight blue, tails fanning out like a comet's trail.

"Why do you flee the change?" it asks, voice a melody of wind chimes and wolf howls. You open your mouth to answer, but the words turn to laughter, bubbling up uncontrollably as the rain shifts to petals—rose and lightning-bloom—soft against your skin. The fox grins, teeth like crescent moons, and offers a paw. "The storm isn't ending the dream," it says. "It's rewriting it."

You take the paw, and together you leap into the inverted city, where gravity is a suggestion and time folds like origami. Streets loop into memories you haven't lived yet: a marketplace of bottled sunsets, a library where books read themselves aloud in your childhood tongue, a bridge over a river of liquid dreams that tastes like honey and regret.

As dawn bleeds through the clouds—impossibly, for storms don't yield so easily—you find yourself back in the forest, but changed. The trees bow in greeting, their leaves etched with the city's map. The fox is gone, but in your pocket, a single silver coin hums softly, waiting for the next squall.

You wake with the echo of laughter in your throat, the scent of rain on your pillow, wondering if the dream ever truly ends—or if it's just the weather turning for the next chapter.
