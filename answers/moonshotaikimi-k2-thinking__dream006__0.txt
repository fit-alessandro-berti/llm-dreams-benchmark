...feel the microphone dissolve into a hummingbird in your palm. Its wings vibrate against your skin with the exact frequency of your racing heart. The audience hasn't noticed—they're still applauding, but their hands are merging together, a thousand palms becoming a single shimmering surface that rises and falls like a tide.

You open your mouth to speak, and instead of words, tiny silver fish swim out, each one carrying a single note of the song you meant to sing. They dart into the crowd, and where they land, people begin to glow softly, their faces becoming paper lanterns with your childhood drawings scribbled on them in crayon.

The teleprompter scrolls backward now, showing every apology you've never made. You try to catch them as they float up, but your hands pass through the letters like smoke. Behind you, the backdrop curtain has become your grandmother's quilt, and you realize the stage is tilting—not falling, but tilting *gently*, like a boat rocking you to sleep.

Someone in the front row is crying, but their tears are turning into small white flowers that sprout from the carpet. You kneel to pick one, and the hummingbird-guide in your hand whispers, *This is the speech. This is always the speech.*

When you stand back up, the audience is gone. The chairs are empty, but still warm. The spotlight has narrowed to a single point of light on your chest, and through your shirt, you can see your own heart glowing—red and gold and pulsing with the rhythm of a language you almost remember.

You wake up midsentence, your mouth still forming the shape of a word that means *I am here* and *I forgive you* and *the water is fine* all at once.
