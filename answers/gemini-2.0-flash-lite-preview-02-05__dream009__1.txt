You wake with a gasp, a chill crawling across your skin despite the warm, humid air. The scent of woodsmoke and something vaguely floral, almost cloying, fills your nostrils. Gone is the familiar hum of the refrigerator, the gentle thrum of the city outside your window. Instead, I'm lying on a rough-hewn bed, covered with a patchwork quilt that feels coarse beneath my fingers. Sunlight, filtered through a small, dusty window, illuminates the earthen walls of a tiny, one-room cottage. 

Panic flares. Where am I? What year is it? My clothes feel strange, a simple, loose-fitting linen shift that would be utterly out of place back home. I try to sit up, but my head throbs with a dull ache.  As I swing my legs over the edge of the bed, my foot bumps against something hard. I look down and see a worn leather pouch, its drawstring cinched tight.

My first instinct is to reach for my phone – the comfort object that usually anchors me.  But there’s no phone, no charger, no electricity. Just the sun filtering through a dusty pane of glass and the echoing silence of a world I don’t recognize.  

As I push myself up and wobble on unsteady legs, I take in more of the room.  A simple wooden table sits near the window, and a crude-looking hearth dominates one wall.  A pot hangs over the smoldering embers, and the air smells of something being slowly, and hopefully, cooked.

Beyond the cottage, the sounds of a life I don't understand begin to filter in.  The clucking of chickens, the distant call of a bird I don't recognize, and the rhythmic *thwack* of…something… against wood.  

Looking out the window, I see a world of rolling green hills, punctuated by fields of something golden and swaying in the breeze.  People, dressed in clothes similar to mine, are working in the fields. Their faces are obscured by distance, but I can tell they are looking towards my cottage. I am not alone, and judging from their expressions, I am clearly an outsider. 

The leather pouch.  I fumble with the drawstring, my hands suddenly clumsy. Inside, I find a small amount of tarnished silver coins, a crudely drawn map of a nearby area and a small, hand-written scroll. I manage to unroll it and discover the writing, filled with elegant swirls and flourishes, is in a language I don't understand.

**...I realize I need to...** find a way to communicate, to understand where I am, and to convince these people I am not a threat. Before the curiosity in their faces turns to suspicion, or worse, fear. I have to understand their world, or I'm sure to die in it. And fast.
