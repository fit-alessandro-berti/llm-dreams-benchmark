 As you move deeper into the maze, you notice the walls begin to breathe. At first, you dismiss it as a trick of the torchlight—flickering shadows playing across sandstone—but then the geometry itself starts to flux. The right-angle corners soften into curves, then twist into Möbius strips that can't decide if they're floor, ceiling, or wall.

The puzzles evolve beyond physical mechanisms. They become recursive thought-loops suspended in amber light: a riddle that answers itself only when you forget the question, a chessboard where the pieces are memories from your childhood arranged in patterns you must rearrange without disturbing the emotional resonance of each move. You solve a lock by realizing you've always been holding the key in a hand that doesn't exist yet.

Deeper still, the air grows thick with crystallized equations. You wade through floating algebraic expressions that attach themselves to your skin like bioluminescent leeches, feeding on the electrical impulses of your neurons. Each step requires you to solve yourself—the maze isn't external anymore; you've become the labyrinth. Your own neural pathways have unfolded into corridors, and every dead end is a forgotten password, every open door a synapse firing.

At the center—if such a word applies to a space that exists in four dimensions—you find not a treasure, but a mirror. But the reflection isn't you. It's the architect. And as your eyes meet, you realize you've been building this maze around yourself the entire time, laying each brick with every decision you've ever second-guessed, every path not taken curling into spiral staircases that lead both everywhere and nowhere.

The final puzzle is simply this: you must choose to wake up without knowing whether waking is just another room in the maze. You reach toward the mirror, your fingers passing through the silvered surface like water, and—

—you open your eyes to your bedroom ceiling, but for a lingering moment, you can still see the ghost of the maze superimposed on the cracks in the plaster, waiting for you to return to sleep and finish what you started.
