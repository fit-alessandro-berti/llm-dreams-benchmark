You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find a way to survive**. The air is thick with the scent of earth and wildflowers, and the distant calls of unseen creatures echo through the trees. You clutch a broken compass and a worn map, but the landmarks are unfamiliar. To stay alive, you must learn how to identify edible plants, construct a shelter, and find water. With every step, the thrill of discovery mixes with the fear of the unknown, urging you to adapt and survive in this untamed world.
