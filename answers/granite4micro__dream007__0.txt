You wake up from the dream feeling exhausted and frustrated. As your eyes flutter open, you realize that the argument in your dream was deeply rooted in your waking life – it concerned a significant decision about career or personal life.

As you reach for your phone to call your friend, your hand trembles slightly. You know deep down that this conversation needs to happen, but at the same time, it terrifies you. The last thing you want is another heated argument with someone who means so much to you. But if left unresolved, both of your futures could be affected.

You try to call your friend's number multiple times during the day, each attempt met with the familiar silence of an unanswered phone. Frustrated but determined not to give up, you decide to send a message instead – a simple "I miss you" or "Thinking about you," something that shows them how much their presence matters even when our words failed us.

As night falls and darkness blankets the room, you lie back down, exhaustion washing over your body. Another day passes without resolution for what feels like an endless debate within yourself. You ponder upon every possible outcome of this argument – from reconciling to breaking off any potential friendship altogether.

In the silence of the night, all that remains is uncertainty and worry about the future of your bond with your friend. But as you drift into sleep, there's a strange comfort in knowing that these dreams are simply reflections of real-life struggles between us and those who matter most – friends we can't afford to lose despite our differences or disagreements.
