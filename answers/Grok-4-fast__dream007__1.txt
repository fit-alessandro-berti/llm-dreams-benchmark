You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to settle it the only way that makes sense in this feverish haze of a dream: by challenging them to a duel at dawn, not with swords or pistols, but with enchanted typewriters that spew forth living words—sentences that coil like serpents and paragraphs that bloom into thorny roses.

The sun hasn't risen yet, but the sky is already a bruised purple, streaked with veins of electric blue. We meet on the rooftop of our old childhood treehouse, now perched impossibly atop a skyscraper that sways like a reed in the wind. Your friend arrives first, their typewriter a gleaming antique with keys that whisper secrets when pressed. Yours is a chaotic beast, salvaged from a junkyard of forgotten novels, its ribbon unraveling into threads of spider silk.

"Last chance to back down," they say, fingers hovering like birds of prey. But you shake your head, the argument's fire still smoldering in your chest—it's about the path not taken, the promise we broke under a harvest moon, the way dreams like this one twist truth into something sharper.

The duel begins with a thunderclap. Your first strike: a flurry of accusations typed in furious staccato, birthing words that lunge forward—*betrayal* snaps at their ankles like a rabid fox, *regret* unfurls wings of shadow to blot out the stars. They counter with eloquence, their prose a tidal wave: *forgiveness* crashes over you in warm, forgiving foam, but laced with barbs of *why didn't you say something sooner?*

The rooftop tilts, gravity loosening its grip as our creations collide mid-air. Sentences entwine, paragraphs devour each other in a frenzy of ink and imagination. A metaphor of yours—a bridge burned to ash—ignites their simile of mended fences, and suddenly the air is thick with phoenix feathers and smoldering timber. We laugh through the chaos, breathless, as the typewriters overheat and begin to melt, pooling into a mirror-like puddle that reflects not our faces, but the faces we might have been if we'd never argued at all.

Dawn breaks, not with light, but with a chorus of unraveling threads. The puddle solidifies into a single, perfect page: blank at first, then filling with our shared story, rewritten in collaborative cursive. We reach for it together, fingers brushing, and the argument dissolves like mist. In the dream's fading echo, you realize the real duel was never about winning—it was about remembering why we fight for each other at all.

And then, as the skyscraper-treehouse crumbles into a cascade of autumn leaves, you wake with the taste of ink on your tongue and a typewriter key tangled in your hair.
