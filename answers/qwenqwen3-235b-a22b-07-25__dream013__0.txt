…as you move deeper into the maze, the air grows thick with the scent of old parchment and damp stone. The walls, once rough-hewn rock, begin to shimmer—morphing into towering shelves lined with glowing, floating books that whisper riddles in languages you’ve never heard, yet somehow understand.

Each puzzle solved causes a soft chime to echo through the corridors, and a door—previously invisible—materializes in the wall. But with every step forward, the rules shift. What was logic a moment ago now unravels like a dream within a dream. A door labeled “Yes” only opens if you speak the answer to a question that has not yet been asked. A bridge of light appears only when you recite a poem backward in your heartbeat’s rhythm.

Then you come to a circular chamber. At its center floats a mirror—but it doesn’t reflect your face. Instead, it shows you a version of yourself from a life you never lived, one where you chose differently at every crossroads. This other you steps out of the glass, holding a key made of starlight.

“You’ve almost reached the center,” they say. “But the final puzzle isn’t solved with logic. It’s solved with surrender.”

Before you can respond, the floor softens like sand, and you begin to sink—not into darkness, but into light. The maze dissolves. You’re falling through colors, through memories that aren’t yours, through equations that sing.

And then—silence.

You open your eyes.

You’re sitting beneath a tree just outside the maze, dawn breaking. The entrance is gone. In your hand is the starlit key, warm and humming faintly. And for the first time, you remember: you weren’t trying to escape the maze.

You were trying to remember why you built it.
