find the puzzles increasing in difficulty. You approach the next test, a set of oddly shaped blocks accompanied by an empty cubic frame. Piecing the entire 3D jigsaw puzzle together, you realise they form a perfect cube that slides into the frame effortlessly. As if initiated by the completion of the puzzle, the thick stone walls of the maze rearrange themselves, revealing another path.

Within each room, there seems to be a theme. Following the path, you enter a chamber filled with mirrors from floor to ceiling. Dimly lit with a cosmic ambiance, a glass pedestal with a spherical puzzle globe in the center draws your attention. Eerily reflective, the globe is a scrambled map of celestial configurations. With the limited knowledge of astronomy you possess, you attempt to align the constellations. With a deep breath, you connect the final two pieces. The globe lights up brilliantly as if a star has been formed in its core. Another pathway brightens up with celestial projections from the globe, guiding your way.

Continuing, you descend into an underground section of the maze lit by flickering torches. Before you stands a chess table with pieces carved from onyx and marble. It’s not a conventional chessboard, but a three-tiered playing field, a 3D chess game. Engaging in a silent duel with an invisible opponent, you calculate possible moves, making strategic decisions. Finally, you call for a checkmate. The room quakes gently, an approval of your success, and a stone stairway leading upwards emerges.

The final room is devoid of light, save for an ethereal glow emanating from a floating orb in the clay-paved floor. You step onto what appears to be an unsolvable ancient script scrolling endlessly on the orb’s surface. Suddenly, you realize that the solution isn't to solve the script, but to trust your instincts and intuition. As the thought crosses your mind, you begin to manipulate the orb without understanding its particular language. As you finish, the orb emits a blinding light that fills the room. A moment later, the light fades to reveal a shimmering archway leading out of the maze.

Stepping into the light, you wake up, the memories of the complex, challenging but intriguing maze still etched in your mind. Despite being a dream, it was an exhilarating intellectual exercise, which rejuvenates and prepares you for the familiar challenges of the waking world.
