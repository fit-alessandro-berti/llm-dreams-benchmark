**Dream Continuation:**  

The wind howls like a chorus of lost souls, and the waves rise like towering obsidian walls, crashing against the hull with a force that rattles your bones. The ship groans under the strain, its timbers protesting the ocean’s fury. Lightning splits the sky, illuminating the faces of your crew—wide-eyed, drenched, but still trusting in your command.  

You grip the wheel, knuckles white, and bellow over the storm:  

**"Reef the sails! Batten down the hatches! Steady as she goes!"**  

The crew scrambles to obey, their movements sharp with adrenaline. The ship lurches violently, but you hold course, navigating by instinct and the faint glow of a compass barely visible in the tempest.  

Then, through the chaos—**a sound.** A deep, resonant hum beneath the waves, something ancient and immense. The water churns unnaturally, and for a moment, the storm itself seems to pause.  

A shadow moves beneath the ship.  

Your first mate locks eyes with you, fear and awe warring in their gaze.  

**"Captain… what do we do?"**  

You take a breath, salt spray stinging your lips. The storm, the sea, the unseen leviathan—it’s all part of the same vast, untamable force. And yet, you are its challenger.  

With a grin as sharp as the lightning above, you answer:  

**"We sail on."**
