in a language you've never seen before. The characters are intricate and mysterious, unlike anything you've ever encountered. You feel a pang of panic, but then you remember a childhood friend who used to speak in a made-up language just for fun. You close your eyes and take a deep breath, trying to recall the patterns and rules of that imaginary language. As you open your eyes, the characters on the exam paper begin to shift and change, slowly transforming into words you can understand. You take your pen and start to write, feeling a sense of calm and confidence. The exam questions are challenging, but you find that you can answer them, one by one, as if you've been preparing for this moment your entire life.
