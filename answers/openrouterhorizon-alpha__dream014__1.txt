and you let yourself be led, hesitant at first, then lighter with each step. Their voices braid into a gentle current, carrying you past neon signs and steaming street carts, past windows where strangers laugh and clink cups. One of them, a woman with a scarf the color of sunrise, points out a narrow passage you would have missed: a sliver of alley where vines climb brick and a cat watches like a small lantern.

“Shortcut,” she says, as if the city had secret chambers that open only to kindness.

You slip through and the noise softens, like the sea pulling back from the shore. The alley widens into a courtyard lit by paper lanterns, warm circles floating in the dusk. There is a map painted on a wall—your city, but also not: rivers you don’t remember, little icons of bridges and gardens and a compass that turns itself as you breathe. One of the strangers traces a path with a fingertip. It glows, then fades, and the glow remains inside your chest.

You walk. The streets know your feet now. A busker’s violin stitches the air. A baker hands you a piece of sweet bread for no coin. The world seems to tilt toward you, small tilts, the way a friend leans in to hear. You start to recognize things you’ve never seen—an arch that feels like a home you’ve dreamed, a door painted the exact blue of a childhood sky. The city is still vast, but no longer indifferent; it listens when you name your fear, and answers with lights that flicker like eyelids waking.

At a crosswalk, you stop. The kind strangers arrange themselves around you as if forming a constellation. “There,” the tallest one says, and you follow his gaze. Across the street is not a destination but a mirror. In it, you are standing with them, and you are also standing alone, and you are also the street, the window, the lanterns, the breath rising into the cool night. You realize the map on the wall was laid over your heart all along.

The light changes. You step forward. You don’t thank them out loud—you don’t need to. They smile as if they’ve heard you. When you look back, they are gone, or perhaps they’ve become the crowd, or perhaps they were always part of you. You keep walking. The city opens like a book whose pages are warm from someone else’s hands, and every corner is a word you can read now.

You turn the last corner and find not the place you were trying to remember, but a bench beneath a tree strung with tiny bells. The bells ring when the breeze passes through, and each note sounds like your name spoken kindly. You sit. You breathe. You are not lost. The bells keep ringing, soft and sure, calling you home to where you are.
