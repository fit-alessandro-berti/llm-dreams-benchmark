...and each challenge feels more surreal than the last.  

First, you’re handed a blank canvas and told to paint the sound of your own heartbeat. You dip your brush into a jar of liquid moonlight and strokes bloom into colors that hum—deep indigo for the lows, shimmering gold for the highs—until the canvas breathes in rhythm with your chest. The judges nod, eyes closed, listening with their fingertips.  

Next, you’re blindfolded and led into a library where every book is written in a language you’ve never seen—but you *understand* them all. You must choose the one that tells your future. Your fingers drift to a slender volume bound in stormcloud-gray leather. When you open it, the pages are empty except for a single line: *“The prize was never the job. It was remembering why you wanted it.”*  

Then comes the final trial: you’re standing on a stage made of melting clocks, facing a mirror that shows not your reflection, but your *absence*. Your task? Make yourself visible again—not with light, but with purpose. You close your eyes and speak the truth you’ve buried since childhood: *“I don’t need a title to create. I only need to begin.”*  

The mirror cracks. Not into shards, but into wings.  

Suddenly, the competition hall dissolves into a sunlit studio—your dream job’s workspace. Brushes, keyboards, blueprints, and half-finished projects hum with potential. But the grand prize isn’t waiting on a pedestal. It’s in your hands. You’ve been doing it all along.  

The dream ends as you pick up a pencil… and wake up reaching for paper.
