the wind picks up, swirling leaves and branches around you like dancers in a chaotic ballet. The once-gentle sunlight is swallowed by thick, ominous clouds that press down on the canopy, casting everything in an eerie, gray light. Thunder rumbles in the distance, growing louder with each step you take. 

As you continue deeper into the forest, the air becomes colder, and the trees seem to lean in, their twisted branches reaching out as if trying to grasp at you. The ground beneath your feet feels softer, almost spongy, as if it’s absorbing the storm’s energy. You notice that the path ahead is disappearing, swallowed by the encroaching shadows.

Suddenly, a flash of lightning illuminates the trees, and for a brief moment, you see something moving between them—something large and dark, but too fleeting to make out clearly. Your heart races, and you quicken your pace, though the storm seems to be closing in from all sides. The wind howls louder, and the trees begin to whisper, their voices low and unsettling, as if they’re sharing secrets only they can hear.

Then, without warning, the rain starts—a torrential downpour that pounds against your skin like icy daggers. You try to find shelter, but the trees seem to close in even tighter, their trunks forming an impenetrable wall. Just as you’re about to give in to the panic rising inside you, you spot a faint glow ahead, barely visible through the deluge. It’s coming from a small clearing surrounded by towering, ancient stones.

You push through the last of the trees, and as you emerge into the clearing, the storm quiets, though the rain continues to fall softly. In the center of the clearing stands a stone altar, its surface smooth and polished despite the weather. A single candle flickers weakly in the center, casting long shadows across the stones. As you approach, the whispers in the wind grow louder, more insistent, urging you closer to the altar.

You hesitate, your hand hovering just above the flame. The storm rages on beyond the clearing, but here, in this small, sacred space, there is a strange sense of calm. You take a deep breath and place your hand gently over the flame. It doesn’t extinguish, but instead, the fire grows brighter, filling the clearing with warmth and light. The whispers fade, replaced by a soft hum, like the distant sound of water flowing over rocks.

And then, as if in response to your touch, the stones begin to shift, rearranging themselves into a circle around the altar. The rain stops, and the sky above clears, revealing a star-filled night. The moon rises high, casting silver beams through the trees, and for the first time since the storm began, you feel at peace.

You sit quietly, watching the stars, listening to the soft rustling of the wind in the trees, and waiting to see what will come next.
