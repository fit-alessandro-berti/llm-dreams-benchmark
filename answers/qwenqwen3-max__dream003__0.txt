...a faint, rhythmic hum emanating from within, like a heartbeat made of starlight. The intricate patterns—interlocking spirals, celestial glyphs, and what look like ancient musical notes—are not merely etched into the wood; they shift subtly as you trace your fingers over them, responding to your touch with a soft, warm pulse.

You turn the box over in your hands and discover a small indentation on the underside, shaped like a crescent moon cradling a single teardrop. Without thinking, you press your thumb into the hollow. The hum deepens, resonates through your bones, and the patterns on the lid begin to glow—a pale silver light that spreads like liquid moonlight across the surface.

Suddenly, the box floats from your palms, hovering inches above your outstretched hands. The lid doesn’t swing open—it dissolves, unraveling into shimmering threads of light that spiral upward like smoke, revealing not an interior filled with trinkets or treasure, but a miniature, swirling galaxy. Stars are born and die in seconds within its depths, nebulae bloom and collapse, and at its center floats a single, perfect key—crafted not of metal, but of pure memory.

As you reach toward it, a voice—not spoken aloud, but felt in the core of your being—whispers:  
*“This key does not open the box. The box opens you.”*

And then you remember: you’ve held this box before. Not in this life, perhaps, but in another dream, long forgotten. The key is yours. It always was.  

You grasp it—and the dream folds inward, like a page turning in a book written in your own soul.
