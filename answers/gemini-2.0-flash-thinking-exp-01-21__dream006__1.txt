…begin to **sing**.

Not speak, sing.

A melody, completely foreign yet intimately familiar, erupts from your throat, replacing the carefully rehearsed words.  Your prepared speech vanishes like mist in the sun, replaced by a song you've never consciously known, yet it feels as if it’s been waiting within you, yearning to be released. The notes are rich and resonant, weaving a tale of shimmering galaxies and whispering ancient trees.

Looking out at the sea of faces, you expect confusion, perhaps laughter. Instead, a wave of stillness washes over the crowd.  Eyes widen, not in mockery, but in wonder.  Heads begin to nod in time with the rhythm, a subtle, almost imperceptible sway taking hold.  A woman in the front row closes her eyes, a faint smile gracing her lips.

The initial panic melts away, replaced by an exhilarating sense of freedom.  This isn't a speech; it's something more. It's a revelation. In this dream, you are not just speaking *to* them, you are speaking *through* them, connecting to something deeper than words could ever reach.  And you sing on, the song pouring from you like water from a spring, each note resonating with an unspoken truth that fills the vast hall and binds you all together in this strange, beautiful dream.
