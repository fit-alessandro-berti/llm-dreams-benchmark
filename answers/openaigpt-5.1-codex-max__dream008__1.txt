...look down at your hands to begin typing, but they are mittens. Thick, woolen mittens, stitched together out of red tape. Your fingers thump uselessly on the keys, and instead of letters the screen fills with jellyfish, translucent and pulsating, drifting upwards and out of the monitor as if the glass is a surface of a pond.

"I'm waiting," your boss says, but his voice echoes like you're in a cavern. You glance up and his face is a clock now, the hands spinning so fast they blur, ticking louder and louder until it's all you can hear. In the corner of the office, a stack of staplers sighs and begins to melt into the carpet. Your coworkers don't seem to notice; they're all frozen mid-coffee-sip, mid-laugh, mid-scroll, like mannequins in a diorama labeled "Productivity."

You stand, except the chair has become a little boat, and the tiled floor has liquefied into a glossy, mercurial sea of spreadsheet cells. Panic surges. You try to wade, but the grid grips your ankles. The deadline looms over you, an actual guillotine hanging from the ceiling, a neon banner blinking DEADLINE in comic sans.

"Just start," your boss repeats, arms crossed, though now he has four arms, then six, multiplying like an angry starfish. You reach for the nearest tool, which happens to be a banana. You peel it and inside is a roll of code, the lines written in hieroglyphics. You squint, try to translate, but the symbols wriggle off the page and crawl up your sleeves.

Time thunders. You decide, impulsively, to climb into the computer. It yawns open like a maw of light, warm and humming. You dive headfirst. You are falling, and the ticking becomes a heartbeat. The impossible deadline is above you now, a planet with a glowing countdown burning into its surface. You're weightless, paper floating around you, memos and email chains like snow.

Then you remember—this is a dream. A small, calm voice appears, as if on your shoulder, wearing your old gym teacher's whistle. "You don't have to do it," it whispers. "You can fly."

You stretch your mitten-hands out and they are wings. Red tape unfurls into feathers. You swoop up past the countdown planet, past your boss's spinning clock face which wobbles and melts, past the office ceiling that peels back like the lid of a tin can. Sunlight pours in, brighter than any screen glare. The guillotine swings and dissolves into confetti.

As you break through, your alarm clock joins the ticking, its beeps syncing with the heartbeat, and the light turns the inside of your eyelids a soft pink. You take a deep breath, half in the office sea, half in your own bed, and when you exhale, you are awake, the impossible deadline evaporated, your phone buzzing with a snooze option.
