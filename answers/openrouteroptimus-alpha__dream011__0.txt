…written in a language you’ve never seen before. The letters twist and curl like vines, almost moving on the page. Your pen trembles in your hand as you try to focus, but the more you look, the less sense anything makes.

You turn the first page, hoping for at least one familiar word, but the images there spiral off the paper: compasses melting, clocks with too many hands, and a diagram of yourself sitting at the desk where you are right now. Your own face in the drawing looks back at you, wide-eyed.

The professor appears at the front of the room, except it's not your professor. It's a figure with the head of an owl, blinking slowly, reading your confusion. The owl nods, as if to reassure you.

“And what is the answer?” the owl asks, though its beak does not move.

You glance down: the answer blank on your page has already filled itself in with handwriting identical to yours. It says, **“I am still dreaming.”**

The room grows brighter. The walls dissolve into sunlight. You feel yourself relaxing, weightless, as if everything—exam, future, even fear—is just a question floating away on the wind.
