You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you...

**[Dream Continuation:**

The room is silent, the air thick with tension. You glance at the clock—**10:45 PM**. The deadline is **9:00 AM the next day**. You’ve been working on this project for weeks, but now it’s just a blur of tasks, half-finished spreadsheets, and desperate emails to colleagues. Your mind races with the weight of what’s coming next.

Your boss steps forward, their eyes sharp with urgency. “We need this done by tomorrow morning,” they say, voice steady but laced with pressure. “This is critical for the company’s quarterly report.”

You feel a knot form in your stomach. You’ve never dealt with anything like this before. This isn’t just a project—it’s a test of your ability to lead, to make decisions, to *fail* if necessary. You take a deep breath, forcing yourself to think clearly.

“Can I get some time to review the existing data and see what we can do before we start?” you ask, hoping it sounds calm and professional.

Your boss nods slowly. “Of course. But if you’re not ready by 9:00, we’ll have to move things forward without you.”

You step back, heart pounding, and begin to gather your thoughts. You know this is more than just a task—it’s a chance to prove yourself. You pull out your phone, open a new document, and start organizing the information you’ve already collected. It’s not perfect, but it’s a beginning.

As you work, the dream feels heavier, as if the weight of the deadline is pressing down on you. You can hear the ticking of the clock, the hum of the office, and the distant sound of someone laughing in the hallway. But you don’t stop. You don’t look back.

You’re not ready yet—but you’re moving forward. And that’s enough.
