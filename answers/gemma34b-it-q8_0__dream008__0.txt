...and looking directly *through* me, not in an unpleasant, hostile way, but as if I simply wasn't there in that moment. My stomach lurged a cold, familiar dread. It started subtly, a flicker on the spreadsheets, a repeating jiggle on a presentation’s logo. Then it exploded - every digital thing in my line of sight morphed into shimmering ribbons of liquid neon. The glow pulsated inwards, dissolving the familiar steel framework of the office building and replacing it with a colossal, swirling nebula of purple, green, and gold.

My boss, Mr. Henderson, wasn't angry. He wasn’t even surprised. Just a placid observer perched on a floating platform, casually sipping an iced tea. Around him formed miniature, perfectly rendered replicas of animals - a penguin carefully stacking files, a sloth coding with alarming speed, a tiny rhinoceros arguing intensely over a color scale. Their voices, rendered as intricate musical notes, hummed a complicated, rhythmic warning. 

“You have three nebulas. Three hours to design it,” he said, his voice a low, resonant chord. “It must be beautiful. But simultaneously functional. And it cannot bear any earthly gravity.”

He tossed a single, iridescent seed towards me. As it landed in my outstretched hand, it pulsed with a warm light and unfolded into a complex, fractal pattern covering my palm – intricate circuitry, blooming geometries, and constellations mapping themselves out onto my skin. I realised with chilling clarity that *I* was both the design and the project.  

Panic threatened, but then I noticed the penguin was offering me a tiny hammer and wrench.  Ignoring the rising tidal pressure felt subtly emanating outwards, I examined the fractal pattern on my hand. Understanding bloomed - this wasn’t about creating something new, it was about *transforming* something already existing, a data stream of outdated client records currently swirling around the main lobby.   I was to re-architect the entire history of our business with a splash of aesthetic impossible-ness.  

Suddenly, a small, fluffy badger popped up near my feet and whispered, “Don’t stress!  Adding extra glitter makes anything work."  As it scurried off, I realized looking back at Mr. Henderson, the floating animals were starting to assemble tiny components— resistors, circuit boards, miniature LEDs – placing them carefully around the periphery of my workspace, guiding the flow of the nascent design.

It then hit me— the deadline wasn't a constraint, it was a suggestion, a playful dance conducted by a universe that seemed simultaneously utterly serious and absolutely delighted in messing with its inhabitants on a Tuesday afternoon. I sighed— beautifully, deliberately - and began to architect my anxieties into glittering constellations. 

Then everything melted into a single, enormous strawberry, vibrating slightly and smelling intensely of summer sunshine. And I woke up, sweating, with an unshakeable certainty that everything, even the most insurmountable deadlines, somehow held a ludicrous possibility of beauty.
