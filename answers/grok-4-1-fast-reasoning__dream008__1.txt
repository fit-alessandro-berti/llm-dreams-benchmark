You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you panic, fumbling for your keyboard—only to find it's turned into a swarm of wriggling earthworms. "Type faster!" your boss bellows, but now he's morphed into a colossal clock with arms like pendulums, ticking louder and louder, the hands spinning backward.

You bolt from your desk, racing down endless corridors that stretch like taffy, cubicle walls melting into candy cane stripes. Colleagues float by like helium balloons, whispering deadlines in backwards Latin. You dive into the break room for coffee, but the machine spits out bubbling lava. "Due in five minutes!" the clock-boss roars from above, now hovering on rocket boosters.

Desperate, you grab a stapler and start hurling reports into the void—papers multiply into origami birds that flap chaotically, forming a tornado of memos. The deadline hits: zero hour. Everything freezes... then explodes into confetti. You wake up gasping, tangled in sheets, with your alarm blaring like a laughing hyena. Just another "work" dream.
