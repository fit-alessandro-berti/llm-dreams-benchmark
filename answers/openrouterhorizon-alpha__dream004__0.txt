you feel the canvas breathe, as if it has been waiting for you. A wind made of silk and whispers folds itself around your shoulders, and the ground beneath your feet slides from checkerboard to meadow to quiet, silver water. You reach out. Your fingertip leaves a note instead of a mark—an A that tastes like citrus—and it hums in the air. Where it falls, a thin line of cobalt grows like ivy.

You paint without paint. You think of warmth, and a sun spills open, not above but within the canvas, pouring honeyed light that drips into puddles of gold you can walk across. You think of laughter, and the edges of the world curl like ribbon, tying themselves into bows that bob with the rhythm of a heartbeat. Shapes nudge the corners of your thoughts, eager to be born: a triangle that chirps, a circle that sighs, a spiral that remembers your name.

Colors behave like weather here. A purple storm approaches on tiny glass feet, shaking out a rain of lilac moths that land on your shoulders and fall asleep. The horizon folds like paper, and when you open it again there is a city made of vertebrae and bell towers, where the bells ring only when you forget what day it is. You step toward it, and the step goes on for a long, long time without moving, because the path has decided to be a poem for a while.

You speak, and your words drift as constellations across the canvas. Some turn to bridges, and you walk them; others become keys without locks, warm in your pockets. When you don’t speak, silence braids the grass into rivers. You learn the grammar of this place: questions bloom, exclamations burn, commas become small birds that perch on your shoulder when you hesitate. A period is a door. You put one down.

Inside the door, a room is growing itself: velvet stairs, a teacup with the ocean sealed inside, a clock measuring the distance between two blinks. On the walls, portraits of people you almost were tilt their heads toward you. One winks. The floor is a book written in footprints: yours, and yours, and yours, each a little different, each leading deeper in.

You press your palm to the canvas, and it presses back. A forest unspools from your hand—trees with lanterns for fruit, roots that braid into hammocks. In the hammock lies an animal that might be a fox or a violin. It yawns a melody you remember from a year that hasn’t happened yet. You hum along, and the canopy of leaves rearranges itself into a map. There’s a place marked with a circle, and a note: You left this for yourself.

You go there by closing your eyes.

You arrive somewhere soft: snow made of confetti, confetti made of memories, memories made of light. The blank canvas has followed like a patient moon. It leans toward you as if to hear. You realize it is not blank at all; it is a mirror with amnesia. You lift it, and your reflection is a collage of all the colors you have touched: echo-blue, cinnamon-red, a green that feels like forgiveness. The shapes orbit you like polite planets.

“What were you trying to draw?” asks a voice that might be the wind, might be your older self, might be the shape of a question. You try to answer and find you’ve already drawn it without knowing: a doorway in the middle of a bridge made of laughter, leading to a room with velvet stairs, where a fox-violin naps in a hammock, where a teacup holds the ocean, where the bells ring only when you forget.

You step back and the whole landscape inhales. The canvas loosens its edges and spills itself over the world. Now the sky wears brushstrokes, and the river keeps time for a parade of floating doorways. People you love walk through them in the wrong order and wave. They carry handfuls of commas, and release them like white birds. One lands on your shoulder, warm as a promise.

You could stay. You could keep painting until the night learns your palette and the morning recites it back in birdsong. But some gentle gravity has placed a thread at your wrist. You tug it and feel the tug returned from far away—a room, a bed, a name. You dip your finger one last time into the quiet color between colors and draw a small mark in the corner of the sky, a signature only you will recognize when you look up on an ordinary day.

The wind of silk gathers itself, the city folds into a pocket, the moths wake and lift, the fox-violin stretches. The canvas looks at you with closed eyes, content, and you understand you have not finished it but taught it how to begin. As you turn toward the place where the thread leads, the world tilts, the bells ring once, and the period becomes a door again.

You walk through, carrying a little of that cobalt ivy on your hands, and the morning carries a little of you.
