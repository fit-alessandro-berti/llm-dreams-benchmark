grip the helm tightly, feeling the cold spray of saltwater against your face. The ship lurches as towering waves crash against its hull, and lightning streaks across the sky, momentarily illuminating the terrified expressions of your crew.

"Hold steady!" you shout over the roaring wind. "Reef the sails! Brace for the next wave!"

Your first mate scrambles to your side, his voice barely audible against the howling storm. "Captain, there's something in the water!"

You squint into the darkness, and for a moment, you see it—a massive shadow beneath the churning waves, moving with unnatural speed. The ship shudders violently as if some unseen force is reaching up from the depths.

A monstrous shape rises from the sea.

A creature of impossible size, with gleaming eyes like lanterns in the storm. Tentacles swirl around the ship, and the crew recoils in horror. Thunder booms overhead, and your heart pounds.

You have no time to think.

Do you order your crew to ready harpoons and fight, or do you steer the ship into the wind, attempting to escape the beast’s grasp?
