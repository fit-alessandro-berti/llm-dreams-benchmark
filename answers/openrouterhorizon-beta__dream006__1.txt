…speak, but the microphone crackles and your voice comes out as a chorus of other people’s voices—teachers, friends, strangers—layered over your own. The audience doesn’t seem surprised. Their faces blur and refocus, shifting through familiar expressions like cards in a deck. You glance down at your notes to steady yourself, but the paper is blank except for a single line that reads: “Remember the door.”

There is a door at the back of the stage that you don’t remember from rehearsal. Small, painted the same color as the curtain, almost shy. You feel a tug behind your ribs, as if a string is drawing you toward it. You start to apologize to the audience, but instead you hear yourself tell a joke you’ve never heard before, and they laugh like bells in the fog. This comforts you and frightens you at once. You step toward the door. The stage lights brighten to a hot white, and the audience leans forward, expectant, as if they too are waiting for you to go somewhere.

When you touch the doorknob, it is cool and damp, like a stone by a river. The moment it turns, the stage quiets; even your shoes stop making sound. On the other side is not a backstage, but a hall lined with clocks. They are all keeping different times, some ticking forward, some backwards, some stuttering in place like nervous hearts. You step inside and the door swings shut with a whisper. The laughter from the theater continues faintly, as if seeping through a radio in another room.

You walk, and as you do, the clocks begin to chime. Each chime is a memory: the smell of new pencils, the first time you crashed your bicycle, a winter morning when your breath made clouds. The chimes layer until they become a wave that lifts you, and you realize the hall is slowly tilting downward like the inside of a great instrument. You slide, laughing because you cannot fall, only glide, and the clocks become stars drifting past your fingers, which leave ripples in the air.

At the end of the hall is a window. Beyond it, the stage again—but now the audience is replaced by a night sky full of faces, constellations drawn in the lines of people you loved, people you almost met, people you will be. They blink like lighthouse beams, guiding, forgiving. You push the window open and step through, and you are back at the podium, your notes again blank, your heart full of the hall’s strange music.

You clear your throat. This time your voice is only your own, but it carries like tidewater, full and patient, and as you speak you realize that the speech is not something you prepared but something you are remembering. You tell them about the door and the clocks and the feeling of sliding without falling. You tell them about the way the stars looked like faces and how fear can be a hallway if you let it. The crowd is utterly silent, listening as if each word is a lantern being lit in their chests.

A child in the front row raises a hand and asks what is on the other side of the last clock. You smile because you don’t know, and you say so, and the relief that runs through the room is warm as tea. Then the lights dim and the stage begins to float, lifting you gently until you are high enough to see that the theater is actually a boat and the audience is water and your speech is rain. Everyone is shining. Everyone is listening.

When you finish, the applause doesn’t sound like clapping. It sounds like waves turning stones smooth. You bow, and as you rise, you notice the small door has appeared again at the edge of your vision, waiting patiently. You think, not yet, and it seems to understand. The curtains close like eyelids. Somewhere, a clock ticks once, kindly, and stops. You step forward into the hush, and the hush steps back, and you wake with the taste of laughter and salt on your tongue, a sentence still forming, the door’s cool memory on your palm.
