You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in an ancient, glowing script that shifts and morphs every time you blink, like liquid mercury on the page. At first, you try to make sense of it—words that look like a mix of hieroglyphs and binary code—but they rearrange into personal memories: your childhood fears, forgotten dreams, and that one embarrassing moment from high school.

Panic sets in as the proctor, who strangely resembles your old math teacher but with tentacles for arms, hands you a pencil that keeps dissolving into sand. You glance around the room, and the other students are animals— a wise old owl scribbling furiously, a squirrel chattering answers out loud, and a cat napping on its desk, apparently acing the test by sheer feline nonchalance.

You attempt to answer the first question: "Describe the quantum entanglement of your life's regrets in relation to tomorrow's breakfast." But as you write, the paper absorbs your words and starts whispering back at you, mocking your choices. The clock on the wall ticks backward, and suddenly, you're not in a classroom anymore—you're floating in a vast ocean of floating equations, with sharks made of deadlines circling below.

Just as the pressure builds and you feel like you'll drown in this absurd chaos, a bright light envelops everything. You wake up in your bed, heart racing, with your alarm blaring. Was it just a dream? Or a subconscious warning to study harder? Either way, maybe it's time to grab some coffee and face the real world. What a wild ride—want to explore another twist in the dream?
