accept their offer, feeling a flicker of hope. They lead you through winding alleys and hidden courtyards, places you never would have found on your own. The city, once overwhelming, now feels alive with possibility.

One of the strangers, a woman with warm eyes, hands you a small, intricately carved wooden key. "This will open the door you need," she says, though you don’t yet know what that means. The others nod in agreement, their faces glowing with quiet confidence.

As you walk, the city shifts around you—buildings stretch upward like trees, and the streets hum with a soft, rhythmic pulse. You realize you’re not just lost in a place, but in time. The strangers guide you toward a towering archway, its surface covered in swirling, glowing symbols. The woman places the key in your hand, and you feel its warmth seep into your skin.

"Go through," she urges. "But remember—what you find on the other side is already inside you."

You take a deep breath and step forward. The archway dissolves into mist, and for a moment, you’re weightless, suspended between worlds. Then—

You wake up, the key still clutched in your hand. But it’s not wood anymore. It’s made of starlight.

And you know, somehow, that the city was never the real dream. *You* were.
