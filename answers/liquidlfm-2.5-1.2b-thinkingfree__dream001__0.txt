You start to look around the swirling chaos of the city—a symphony of clattering trams, murmured conversations, and the flicker of neon signs that cast jagged shadows. Your breath quickens, yet intuition clings, tugging you toward a flicker of light. A rictus smile flashes beneath your eyes, though you struggle to see it, and then a shadow shifts: a figure cloaked in a tattered cloak materializes at the edge of a bridge, their silhouette lending itself to mimic the reflection of a passerby. *Perhaps…* Wait—that’s you earlier. The figure tilts their head, a whisper of something familiar: *"The meeting is where time bends."* Before you can process, one foot finds the glint of a luminous door far ahead, its surface humming with possibility. 

The city exhales as your pulse syncs with the beat of an unseen clock. What follows is a blur of possibility—leading you into familiarity, yet revealing a square lost in time, where walls hum with forgotten names. There, atop a pedestal of shadows, stands a mirror that refuses to show you—or *chooses*—to speak. You step forward, not knowing why, with the echo of urgency cradling you like a lifeline… But the door yawns open, and the meeting awaits, its face soft, yet distinct in the pulse of your own fate. 

*You meet it.* (Yes. Always meets itself. Just in another form.)
