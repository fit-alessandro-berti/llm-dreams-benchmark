The air grows thick and heavy, pressing against your skin like a damp wool blanket. The gentle breeze dies instantly, replaced by an unnatural, anticipatory stillness. The vibrant greens of the forest deepen to murky, bruised hues. You look up, and the peaceful blue sky you were just walking under has vanished.

Instead, a churning wall of bruised purple and sickly green clouds roars towards you, devouring the horizon. It moves with impossible speed, not rolling, but *sweeping*, like a dark curtain being violently drawn across the world. The first drops don't fall; they *sizzle* onto the dry leaves, leaving faint, shimmering trails that vanish before hitting the ground. They feel warm, almost electric.

Then, the wind hits. Not a breeze, not a gust – a physical *force* that knocks the breath from your lungs. It doesn't whistle; it *roars*, a sound like a thousand voices screaming in unison. Trees groan, ancient branches lashing like whips. Leaves are torn from the canopy in a frantic, swirling green storm that blots out the sun.

You stumble, grabbing onto the rough bark of a massive oak for stability. The rain starts – not water, but thick, cold **liquid light**. It falls in sheets, each drop bursting into a shower of iridescent sparks against the forest floor. The sparks hiss, smelling faintly of ozone and crushed mint. You can feel the strange energy in the air, making the hairs on your arms stand on end and your teeth ache.

Through the curtain of sparkling rain and the blinding flashes of lightning that now crackle across the sky (silent at first), you see shapes moving *within* the storm. Not clouds, but things that pulse and writhe – like giant, amorphous jellyfish woven from storm clouds and lightning, drifting through the turmoil. They leave faint, glowing trails in their wake. A low, resonant hum vibrates through the ground, a sound that seems to come from the earth itself, harmonizing with the wind's scream.

Suddenly, the roar softens, transforming into something else... a sound like distant, ethereal chimes, blending with the hum. The violent wind calms to a powerful, steady flow that pushes you gently forward. The liquid rain becomes softer, falling like shimmering silk threads. The bizarre shapes within the storm slow their frantic dance, drifting peacefully now.

One of the cloud-jellyfish detaches from the main storm mass. It drifts closer, pulsing with soft, internal light – blues and silvers. It doesn't feel threatening; it feels... *curious*. As it nears the canopy overhead, the trees below it seem to lean towards it, branches trembling with a faint, visible light. The air fills with the scent of petrichor and something sweet, like wild honeysuckle.

The cloud-being pauses directly above you. The light pulses brighter, and for a moment, you feel an overwhelming sense of peace wash over you, calming the chaos. You understand, without words, that this isn't destruction. It's a cleansing, a transformation. The storm wasn't *coming* to you; it *was* you, a part of the forest's wild, untamed soul awakening.

The light softens. The cloud-being drifts away, rejoining the dissipating storm front, which now looks less like a monster and more like a vast, swirling nebula fading into the twilight. The strange rain slows to a gentle sprinkle of normal water, sparkling in the returning rays of the sun breaking through the thinning clouds. The hum fades into the gentle gurgle of a stream nearby, which wasn't there before.

You stand alone in the suddenly quiet, glistening forest. The air is fresh, cool, and impossibly clean. The trees look renewed, their leaves vibrant. You feel strangely calm, as if you've just witnessed something profound and ancient. The path ahead looks different – wider, clearer, leading towards a soft, golden light filtering through the trees.

You take a deep breath, the scent of wet earth, clean air, and that lingering sweetness filling you. The dream shifts, the forest melting away not into darkness, but into the soft, gentle embrace of waking light. You feel rested, changed by the wild beauty you just walked through.
