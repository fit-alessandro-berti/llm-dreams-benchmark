You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **take a deep breath**.

The air feels charged, like static electricity. Your heart races, but you force yourself to stay calm. You look at your friend, their face red with anger, and you realize that this isn’t just about one thing—it’s about *trust*.

You take a step back, letting the tension settle. “I know I’ve been unfair,” you say softly, voice trembling. “I didn’t mean to hurt you. I just… I was frustrated.”

Your friend pauses, eyes narrowing. “You’re always like this. You never listen.”

“I’m trying,” you say, shaking your head. “I don’t know why I keep doing this. I just… I don’t want to hurt you.”

A silence hangs between you, thick and heavy. Then, slowly, your friend lowers their gaze. “You’re right. I’ve been too hard on you. I’ve been holding onto resentment instead of forgiveness.”

You feel a lump in your throat. “I’m sorry,” you whisper. “I don’t know how to fix it, but I’m willing to try.”

Your friend exhales, a small smile breaking through. “Let’s talk about it again. But this time, let’s not fight.”

You nod, feeling a strange sense of peace wash over you. The argument is over, but the conversation isn’t. It’s just beginning.
