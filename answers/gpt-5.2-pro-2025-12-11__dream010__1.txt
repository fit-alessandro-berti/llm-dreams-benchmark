…as the competition progresses, you face various challenges and each one feels less like a test of skill and more like a test of *you*.

The first round takes place in a stadium made of white paper. The crowd is silent, but you can feel their attention like heat. A whistle blows without anyone lifting it to their lips, and a judge in a suit stitched from sticky notes slides a folder across a table.

Inside is a single prompt: **“Prove you belong.”**

You reach for a pen, but it turns into a key. The paper stadium ripples, folding into corridors—cubicles, classrooms, rehearsal spaces, workshops—every version of a “place you should be doing something” you’ve ever known. Doors line the hall. Each door has a label:

- **THE THING YOU’RE GOOD AT**
- **THE THING YOU WANT**
- **THE THING YOU’RE AFRAID TO WANT**
- **THE THING YOU SAID YOU’D DO LATER**

Competitors rush past you, choosing quickly. You put your hand on the last door.

It opens onto a room that looks like your life, but reorganized. Your unfinished projects sit neatly on shelves like museum artifacts. Conversations you’ve avoided pace the floor like bored cats. On the far wall, a clock counts down not seconds, but *years*.

A voice from above—soft, amused—says, “You can’t win by pretending you’re already finished.”

A bell rings. The room collapses into the next round.

Now you’re on a narrow bridge suspended over a dark ocean. The water below is ink-black, and whenever it moves, it reflects scenes you recognize: a mistake you replay, a moment you wish you’d taken, a version of yourself you almost were. Every step makes the bridge rewrite itself. Planks appear only when you commit your weight.

Halfway across, you hear a competitor behind you whisper, “What if the prize is a lie?”

The bridge shudders. For a moment, the planks become glass and you can see straight through to the ink-water memories, pulling at your ankles with their gravity.

You keep walking anyway. Not because you’re fearless, but because stopping feels like agreeing that fear gets final say.

At the end of the bridge is a small desk and a single blank page. Another prompt:

**“Name what you’re willing to lose.”**

You write: *the version of me that never risks embarrassment.*  
The ink sinks into the paper like a drain, and the desk becomes an elevator.

---

The elevator has no buttons, only a mirrored wall. Instead of your face, you see a montage: you in different rooms, different ages, different postures—leaning in, holding back, leaving early, staying too long.

A new judge appears in the mirror, though you never saw them step in. Their eyes are kind in the way that makes you nervous.

“Third round,” they say. “Collaboration.”

The elevator opens onto a busy office-like labyrinth where teams are building something enormous out of translucent blocks—like a city made of ideas. Everyone has a role. Some people organize, some craft, some convince, some connect. You’re given no title, only a toolbox with strange contents: a compass that points to *interest*, a ruler that measures *effort*, and a small flashlight labeled *attention*.

A teammate asks, “What do you do?”

You almost answer with what sounds safest. Something official. Something you can defend.

But your attention-flashlight clicks on by itself and illuminates a corner of the project no one is looking at—an unstable section everyone keeps patching, again and again, without fixing what caused the cracks.

You walk over. You don’t announce anything. You start rearranging the structure so it can hold its own weight.

Someone protests. Someone nods. Someone joins you. The team shifts, not because you demanded it, but because it makes more sense. The city steadies. Light passes cleanly through it, and for the first time, the whole thing hums.

A buzzer sounds. You’ve advanced.

---

The final round is quiet.

You’re led into a room that resembles a theater, except the seats are empty and the stage is a simple doorway. Above it hangs a sign: **GRAND PRIZE.**

The judge—now standing beside you, no longer in the mirror—holds out two envelopes.

“In one,” they say, “is your dream job. Exactly as you imagine it.”  
They lift the second envelope. “In the other is the job you’d choose if you were no longer trying to prove anything.”

Your mouth goes dry. The air feels thick with the importance of being watched, even though there’s no one there.

“You can only open one,” the judge adds, almost gently. “The other disappears.”

You look at the first envelope and feel your imagination flood it with glamour: applause, certainty, a clean storyline where every past struggle makes perfect sense.

You look at the second and feel something quieter: curiosity. A tug. Not a performance, but a direction.

Your fingers choose before your thoughts do.

You open the second envelope.

Inside is not a job title. It’s a small, folded card. You unfold it and find a sentence written in your handwriting:

**“You are hired to pay attention.”**

The stage doorway creaks open on its own, and beyond it is not an office, not a studio, not a lab—yet it contains all of them. It’s a space that rearranges itself around what you notice. When you focus, tools appear. When you ask a good question, people show up. When you stop pretending you’re certain, new doors unlock.

The judge watches you read the card and nods once, as if the outcome was always obvious.

“Most people,” they say, “think their dream job is a place. It isn’t. It’s a way of moving through the world.”

You step toward the doorway, and the floor under you becomes familiar—not because it’s the same as anything you’ve known, but because your feet finally recognize the feeling of choosing honestly.

As you cross the threshold, you hear the stadium-crowd again, still silent, but no longer heavy. It feels like an ocean, held back, waiting to become sound.

Then the judge calls after you, voice soft and amused:

“One more thing.”

You turn.

They toss you the key that used to be a pen.

“You’ll need this,” they say, “for the mornings.”

You close your fist around it, and the metal warms like it’s alive. The doorway brightens to white. The theater, the city of translucent blocks, the bridge of rewriting planks—all of it fades into a single sensation: the feeling of waking up with something in your hand you didn’t have before.

Your eyes open.

Your palm is empty.

But the feeling remains—like a key-shaped space inside you that fits, perfectly, into the next thing you decide to do.
