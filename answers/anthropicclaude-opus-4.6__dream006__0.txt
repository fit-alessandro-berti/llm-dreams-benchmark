...feel the weight of their gaze like warm sunlight pressing against my skin. I open my mouth, and at first, the words come easily — confident, rehearsed — but then I notice something strange.

The audience isn't sitting in chairs. They're standing in shallow water — ankle-deep, perfectly still, reflecting the stage lights like a dark mirror. No one seems to notice. They're smiling, nodding, waiting.

I keep speaking, but my voice begins to sound different. Deeper. Older. As if someone else is speaking *through* me. I look down at my notes and the words have rearranged themselves into a language I don't recognize — yet somehow I can still read them perfectly.

I say something about doors. About how every room you've ever entered is still open somewhere.

The water begins to rise.

The audience doesn't move. Their expressions remain patient, kind even. A woman in the front row catches my eye and mouths something I can't quite make out. I lean forward, and the podium dissolves like sugar under my hands.

Now I'm standing in the water too. It's warm. It reaches my knees. The lights above begin to flicker and shift into constellations I almost recognize — not quite Orion, not quite anything from childhood, but *close*. Close enough to ache.

I realize I'm no longer giving a speech. I'm listening.

The audience speaks in unison, a single whispered sentence that fills the entire space:

*"You already know what you came here to say."*

And suddenly — I do.

I open my mouth again, and this time the words feel like they've always been mine. I can't remember them when I wake, but in the dream, they are **exactly right**.

The water recedes. The stars go dark. And somewhere, distantly, applause — like rain on a far-off roof.
