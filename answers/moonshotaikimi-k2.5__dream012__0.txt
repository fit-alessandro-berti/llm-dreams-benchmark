 feel the wheel burning cold against your palms—colder than water, colder than iron, humming with a frequency that vibrates in your teeth. The compass spins wildly, not marking north or south but *before* and *after*. When you look at your crew, you see they aren't quite sailors anymore; they are shadows of everyone you've tried to save, their eyes silver coins catching the lightning.

You realize, with the crystalline certainty that only exists in dreams, that the storm isn't weather. It's a question you've been avoiding.

"Let go of the lines," you say. The wind steals your voice, but they hear. In dreams, intention travels faster than sound.

The helmsman gapes as you release the wheel. It spins like a dancer, then snaps off entirely, floating upward into the bruised sky. The crew doesn't panic. They watch you with that terrible, trusting patience of dream-figures, waiting for you to remember what you know.

You walk to the bow. The wave rising before you is a wall of black glass, carved with faces you almost recognize—old lovers, dead parents, versions of yourself that drowned in other storms. The ship tilts vertical. Gravity forgets its rules. The crew floats, tethered to the deck by threads of belief, and you spread your arms wide, captain's coat billowing like broken wings.

You don't steer *through* the wave.

You breathe it in.

The salt doesn't choke you; it becomes language. The thunder resolves into a heartbeat—your own, slowed to a prehistoric rhythm. The wave crashes not onto the deck but *into* your chest, and you feel every drop: the time you failed, the time you lied, the time you let go too soon. You hold them all without drowning.

The ship rights itself. The storm doesn't end—it *listens*. The rain hangs suspended in the air, a million glass beads, and through them you see that the sea isn't water at all but a vast membrane breathing in and out. You place your hand on the mast, and wood becomes bone, becomes bridge, becomes the spine of something ancient waking up.

"Sleep now," you tell the crew, though you're the one dreaming. "We're already home."

The horizon folds like warm wax. The stars descend to guide themselves by *you*. And as the first gray light of waking creeps across this impossible ocean, you feel the transition—the captain becoming the sleeper, the ship becoming the bed, the storm becoming the sound of your own blood, quiet and safe and carrying you back to shore.
