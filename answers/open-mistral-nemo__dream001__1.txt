frantically look around, trying to get your bearings. You notice a grand, old-fashioned clock tower in the distance, its hands showing it's already noon. You remember that the meeting is at 1:00 PM, so you have just enough time to find the place if you hurry.

You approach a nearby street vendor selling maps and ask for one of the city. They hand you a worn-out, hand-drawn map with no names or labels, just intricate lines and symbols. You thank them and unfold the map, trying to make sense of it.

As you study the map, you notice a symbol that resembles the clock tower. You trace your finger along the line connected to it, following it until you find another symbol that looks like a building with a spire - the meeting place, perhaps?

You look up from the map and spot the spire in the distance, not too far from the clock tower. You start walking towards it, weaving through the crowded streets. The city is a mix of old and new architecture, with narrow cobblestone alleys leading to wide, modern avenues.

As you get closer to the spire, you realize it's part of a magnificent cathedral. You enter the cathedral, feeling a sense of awe at its grandeur. Inside, it's quiet and cool, a stark contrast to the bustling city outside. You walk down the main aisle, looking for any signs of your meeting.

Suddenly, you hear a soft humming sound coming from one of the side chapels. You approach it and see an elderly woman sitting alone, humming a familiar tune. She looks up at you and smiles, beckoning you to come closer.

"Ah, you've found me," she says, her voice warm and welcoming. "I've been expecting you. We have much to discuss, but first, let's find you something to wear. You can't attend a meeting like that, can you?"

She stands up and leads you to a small door behind the chapel, revealing a hidden room filled with elegant clothing. You choose a suitable outfit, feeling a sense of relief and excitement as you prepare for the meeting. The dream continues...
