You wake with a gasp, a cold wind whipping at your face. The air is thick with the smell of woodsmoke and something else... something earthy and unfamiliar. My head swims, disoriented. The last thing I remember was the hum of my laptop, the glow of the screen... Now, the sun, a harsh, unfamiliar sun, beats down on my face.

I sit up, and the ground is uneven and hard, covered in rough, dry grass. Gone are the familiar comforts of my apartment. Instead, I'm surrounded by a landscape I don't recognize. Rough-hewn wooden structures huddle together in the distance, and the sounds of a life I've never known fills the air: the clucking of unseen fowl, the rhythmic clang of metal on metal, and the murmur of voices speaking in a language that is both foreign and strangely familiar, like a half-remembered folk song.

I'm wearing clothes that feel wrong – roughspun trousers and a tunic that chafes against my skin. My bare feet are already gritty with dirt. Where am I? When am I? Fear, cold and sharp, begins to prick at my skin.

I take a tentative step, then another. As I move, I realize I'm weak, my muscles protesting after what feels like a long period of inaction. I stumble, nearly falling. Looking down, I see my hands are calloused and rough, as if I've been working a life I never lived.

A young boy, no older than eight, pauses in his work, watching me with wide, curious eyes. He's hauling a small wooden cart, filled with what looks like dried herbs and bundles of kindling. He points at me, then at the nearby settlement, and says something in that strange language. It's clear: he wants me to go there.

The implications hit me like a blow. No phone, no internet, no familiar comforts. I'm utterly alone, stranded in a place and time I don't understand. My modern knowledge, the sum total of my education and experience, feels useless here. 

As the initial shock begins to recede, a deeper understanding begins to dawn. I am utterly vulnerable. Survival will be a constant struggle. I need to...
**...find someone who speaks a language I can understand, learn the skills necessary to contribute to this society, and find shelter and sustenance before the sun sets and the cold night descends. My modern world, my past life, is gone. My only focus has to be on survival and figuring out how I can possibly fit into this new, harsh reality.**
