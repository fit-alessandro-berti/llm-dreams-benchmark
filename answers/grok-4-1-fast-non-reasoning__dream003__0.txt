symbols etched into its surface—swirling vines that seem to pulse faintly, like veins under skin. Your fingers trace them, and a whisper of air escapes from hidden seams, carrying the scent of ancient earth and forgotten rain. Suddenly, the patterns glow with an ethereal blue light, rearranging themselves into a riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

An echo bounces in your mind—*an echo*. You whisper it aloud, and the box shudders, clicking open with a sound like distant thunder. Inside lies a shimmering key, not to any door you've seen, but to the heart of the dream itself. You grasp it, and the world tilts: walls of cloud form around you, stars cascade like waterfalls, and a voice—your own, yet wiser—laughs softly. "Awaken changed," it says, as the box dissolves into mist, leaving you hovering in endless sky, ready to fall or fly. What do you choose next in this dream?
