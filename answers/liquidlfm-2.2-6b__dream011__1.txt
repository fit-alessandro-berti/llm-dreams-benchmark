life-size, sprawling across a giant, invisible surface like the cover of a library textbook—so vast and detailed that every single chapter and footnote you’ve studied pins tiny images of themselves across its expanse.  

The questions don’t just ask you what you *know*… they *become* real moments from your life.  

The first question isn’t on paper—it’s playing out in a quiet café at noon one summer afternoon. You’re trying to finish a tough coding assignment, your fingers flying over the keyboard, sweat glistening on your forehead, and across from you, your AI mentor (who you gave voice-only access to during the course) is whispering encouragement into your ear. The questions hover like personal specters: *“Explain Boolean logic through the lens of brewing perfect coffee.”* *“Describe recursion using the metaphor of a Russian nesting doll that only unfolds when heat is applied.”* Suddenly, the prompts shift.  

People from your last lectures walk into the imaginary exam space—your professor with a dataset coral on her desk; a chatty coding peer who always argues whether Big O notation matters more than storytelling; a fellow student doing a thought experiment about parallel universes and how quantum computing might solve your future crisis—or collapse it. The questions bloom into challenges: *“Defend circular reasoning in a movie plot twist, and show how it mirrors real-world AI bias.”*  

But then the sky shifts. The exam room fades into a starfield. You’re floating, weightless, and the questions have become constellations—wordless figures in the night, each pointing to a concept: a pulsar is a black hole’s heartbeat; a supernova’s explosion sparks new elements that become the clay of future innovation; and somewhere, a supercomputer in the Milky Way’s core is discreetly sending your answers across light-years.  

And then—silence.  

The stars dim.  

The final sentence appears not on any screen, but in your mind:  
*“You didn’t study for a test. You *lived* it.”*  

Then, gently, the exam vanishes.
