"I need this done by yesterday," your boss says, but his voice sounds strangely metallic, like a recording played backward. As he speaks, his face begins to blur, his features rearranging themselves until he looks less like a boss and more like a large, disapproving clock.

You look down at the project brief to see what the task is, but the words are written in a language you don’t understand—shifting symbols that look like falling rain. You try to type anyway, but the keys on your keyboard have turned into soft, squishy marshmallows. Every time you press one, a loud, wet *squelch* echoes through the silent office, and the other employees—all of whom are now faceless mannequins wearing your father’s clothes—turn to stare at you.

Suddenly, the floor beneath your desk gives way, not into a basement, but into a vast, endless library. You begin to fall, slowly, tumbling through a hurricane of loose papers. As you grab at the sheets, you realize they are all calendars, every single one of them marked with today's date and the word *OVERDUE* stamped in angry red ink.

Just before you hit the ground, you jolt awake, your heart hammering against your ribs, tangled in the sheets, relieved to find that the only deadline you have is to get out of bed.
