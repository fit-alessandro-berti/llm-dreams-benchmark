find a way to survive â€” and fast. The air smells of woodsmoke and wildflowers, and the clothing on your body feels coarse, homespun. People pass by in horse-drawn carts, giving you curious glances. You wander into the village center, where a bustling market stretches out, full of shouting vendors, clinking coins, and the rich aroma of baking bread.

You realize you need to *blend in* before someone notices your strangeness. The first thing is clothing â€” your outfit looks odd, even if itâ€™s simple. You spot a tailorâ€™s stall nearby and head over, offering to help carry bundles in exchange for a tunic and cloak. The tailor eyes you suspiciously but agrees.

As you work, you overhear conversations: rumors of a distant war, a missing heir, a mysterious sickness in the northern woods. Your heart pounds â€” this isn't just a different time. Thereâ€™s something else, something deeper and stranger at play.

Night falls, and the village square transforms. Lanterns glow like floating stars, and a gathering forms around a storyteller who speaks of ancient portals, hidden in the forest, that lead to other worlds.

You grip your new cloak tightly. Maybe, just maybe, that's your way home.  
But first, you need to find someone who believes the old stories â€” and whoâ€™s willing to take you into the dark woods.

Would you like me to keep going? ðŸŒ™
