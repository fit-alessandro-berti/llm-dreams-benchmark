You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you feel the timbers groan beneath your boots like the ribs of some great beast in pain. Rain lashes your face, sharp as needles, and the wind howls like a chorus of lost souls. Lightning fractures the sky, illuminating the terror in your sailors’ eyes—wide, white-rimmed, fixed on you.

For a heartbeat, doubt claws at your throat. The compass spins wildly in its binnacle; the charts are soaked through and useless. But then you remember the old sailor’s proverb your grandmother whispered when you were small: *“When the sea takes your sight, trust your hands.”*

You grip the wheel, knuckles white, and lean into the gale. “Batten the mainsail!” you roar, voice cutting through the chaos like a drumbeat. “Secure the larboard line—Jenkins, mind the boom! Helmsman, hold her steady as she goes!”

Something shifts—not in the storm, but in the crew. Shoulders square. Hands move with purpose. Even in the dark, you see resolve harden in their faces, forged anew by your certainty.

Then, through the sheeting rain, a shape looms—a jagged silhouette against the next flash of lightning. Rocks. The Devil’s Teeth, they called them on the charts. You’re off course, far off. But instinct flares: a memory of your father’s voice, teaching you to read the current’s song beneath the thunder.

“Hard to starboard!” you command. “And… release the sea anchor—now!”

The ship shudders, leans into the turn with a cry of straining rope and timber, and just as the next swell lifts her like a god’s palm, you skim past the black fangs of stone.

The wind lessens—just a breath, but it’s enough. The crew exhales as one. You don’t smile. Not yet. But you meet each of their eyes in turn, and nod.

Because the storm isn’t over. But neither are you.
