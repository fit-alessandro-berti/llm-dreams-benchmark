You feel a storm approaching and the sky cracks open like a shattered mirror, spilling rivers of silver rain that twist into glowing serpents mid-air. The trees around you groan and stretch, their branches weaving into colossal hands that pluck you gently from the ground, lifting you high above the canopy.

Thunder laughs—a deep, rumbling voice you swear you've heard before—and lightning paints the clouds in neon fractals, revealing a hidden city floating among the treetops. Crystal spires pulse with your heartbeat, calling your name in whispers carried on the wind.

You reach out, and the storm parts like curtains, unveiling a doorway in the sky. Stepping through, the forest dissolves into stardust, and you awaken floating in a sea of warm, endless light, the echo of raindrops still dancing on your skin.
