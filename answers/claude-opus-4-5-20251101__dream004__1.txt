*I approach the canvas, feeling its presence hum with possibility*

The canvas floats at chest height, suspended by nothing, rimmed with a frame that shifts between driftwood, bone, and liquid mercury. As I reach toward it, I realize my hands are leaving trails—my fingers smearing the air itself into ribbons of color I've never seen before. Colors that exist between violet and the sound of rain.

I touch the canvas.

It *inhales.*

Suddenly I'm painting, but not with brushes—with memories, with half-forgotten sensations. The taste of a word I almost said to someone years ago becomes a spiral of amber. My childhood fear of basement stairs manifests as geometric shadows that crawl toward the edges, then retreat.

The painting begins painting me back.

I watch as a figure emerges on the canvas—it has my posture but its face is a door, slightly ajar. Behind the door: a garden where the flowers are all questions I've never asked.

The landscape around me notices what I've created. The shifting shapes pause. The colors hold their breath.

The door-face on the canvas creaks open another inch, and warm light spills out, carrying the scent of somewhere I've always been trying to return to—

*And I feel the pull to step through*

Do I?
