**Dream Continuation:**

The air thickens with an electric charge, each breath tingling with ozone. Leaves whip into a frenzied dance as the sky fractures into bruised purples and greens. Thunder groans, not from above but deep within the earth, as if the forest itself is awakening. You stumble forward, roots snaking around your ankles, urging you toward a gnarled oak—its hollow trunk a refuge. 

But lightning cracks the horizon, searing the world in violet light. The struck tree ahead explodes into a shower of embers that *hover*, defying the wind. Among the sparks, a figure materializes—a stag, its antlers branching like silver veins, eyes twin pools of calm. It turns, and the storm stills, rain freezing midair into glistening prisms. 

A path of suspended droplets glows ahead, leading to a cliff’s edge. The stag vanishes. You step onto the rain-beaded trail, each footfall rippling the air like water. Below the cliff, the storm rages as a swirling galaxy of light and shadow. You leap—not into abyss, but into weightless flight, the tempest cradling you like a secret. 

When you wake, the taste of thunder lingers on your tongue, sweet as honey.
