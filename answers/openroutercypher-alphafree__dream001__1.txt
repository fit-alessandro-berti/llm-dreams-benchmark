navigate the city streets, feeling a mix of urgency and disorientation. The buildings around you are towering and anonymous, their faces blurred by the speed of your movement and the haze of early morning light. People brush past you, their expressions obscured by the masks of daily routine, each immersed in their own journey.

As you turn a corner, you spot a tram rushing by, and you decide to chase it, thinking it might lead you to a familiar landmark. Your feet pound against the pavement, and you can feel your heart racing, not just from the physical effort but from the growing pressure of time slipping away.

Just as you catch up to the tram, it comes to an abrupt stop, its doors sliding open. You board hastily, relief washing over you. Yet, when you look up to see the route map, the names and symbols are all written in an unfamiliar script. You are now even more lost, and with every passing minute, the weight of your impending meeting looms larger.

The tram stops again, and you get off, deciding to ask a passerby for help. You approach someone who seems to be taking a break on a nearby bench, but when you speak, your words come out in a strange, foreign accent, and you realize with a jolt that you, too, no longer understand the language.

Feeling utterly disoriented, you take out your phone to use its map feature. Yet, as you press on the screen, it flickers and shows a blank page. In that split second, the phone slips from your hand and falls to the ground, its face cracking upon impact. Panic rises within you; you are now deprived of both direction and communication, left to face the sprawling labyrinth of the city on your own.

In a last-ditch effort, you decide to follow a narrow alleyway that promises a shortcut. It winds and twists in a seemingly haphazard manner, but eventually, you find yourself emerging into a wide-open square. To your relief, the square is filled with familiar sights—iconic sculptures and buildings you've seen in photographs, signs in your own language.

You make your way to the center of the square, gasping for breath but filled with newfound hope. Just when you think you might be able to find your way to your meeting after all, the scene begins to shimmer and dissolve, like a painting losing form.

You blink, and suddenly you are standing in front of a large clock, identical to the one you had seen in your dreams multiple times before. It reads precisely one hour until your meeting, yet no matter how hard you try to move, you find yourself frozen in place, rooted to the exact spot where you stand. The hands of the clock begin to tick forward, loud and deliberate, each tick amplified a thousand times. And yet, you remain immobile, unable to proceed, as the numbers gradually count down to zero.

At that moment, you wake up, your heart pounding fiercely in your chest, the echo of the ticking clock lingering in your ears. You lie in bed, catching your breath and staring at the ceiling, pondering how to navigate the dreams and realities of your waking life.
