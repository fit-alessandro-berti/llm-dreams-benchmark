**Dream Continuation:**

You wake up in a sunlit meadow at the edge of a dense forest, the air thick with the scent of wildflowers and damp earth. The sky is a vast, unbroken expanse of soft blue, and the sun hangs high, casting long shadows that dance across the grass. But something is *off*—the world feels *wrong* in a way that lingers in your bones.

You step forward, and your bare feet sink into the soft soil. The ground beneath you is warm, but not like the heat of a summer day—it’s as if the earth itself is breathing. Then you notice it: the trees are *older* than you’ve ever seen. Their bark is rough, their leaves whispering in a language you don’t recognize. A great oak stands sentinel, its roots twisting deep into the earth like fingers, and its branches stretch toward the sky as if trying to touch the heavens.

A rustling in the undergrowth makes you freeze. A small, furred creature—no larger than a cat—emerges from the bushes, its eyes gleaming with intelligence. It tilts its head at you, then gestures with a paw, as if to say, *"You’re not from here."* You realize then that you’re not just dreaming—you’re *trapped* in a world where time moves differently. The creature’s voice is a chorus of whispers, but you catch the words: *"The Clockwork King is coming."*

Your heart pounds. You’ve heard whispers of this place—*The Hollow*—a realm where time is fractured, where some places age in seconds while others stand still. And now, the last remnants of the old world’s technology are being *reclaimed* by something ancient and hungry. The creature’s fur bristles as it sniffs the air, its tail flicking. *"The machines are waking,"* it says. *"And they’re not happy."*

You turn to see a distant figure—a man in a tattered coat, his face half-hidden by a rusted metal mask. He walks slowly, his steps unsteady, as if he’s been walking for years. His hands are covered in strange, glowing veins of metal that pulse faintly. He doesn’t see you yet, but his gaze locks onto you when he does. His voice is a dry rasp: *"You’ve come back. I knew you would."*

The creature hisses, baring its teeth. *"He’s not supposed to be here!"*

You realize then that you’re not just dreaming—you’re a key. A fragment of the old world’s future, stitched into this time. And the Hollow is about to be torn apart.

**What do you do?**

*(Do you try to understand the creature’s warnings? Seek out the man in the mask? Or something else entirely?)*
