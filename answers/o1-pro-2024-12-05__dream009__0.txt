You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to find food and shelter before nightfall. The morning air is crisp, and as you step outside, you find yourself standing in a small clearing dotted with wildflowers. Beyond the clearing lies a dense woodland, its trees unfamiliar in shape and bark texture. The sky appears clearer, bluer, as though the world has not yet known the touch of industry.

At first, you search your person for any familiar objects—your phone, a watch, even a scrap of paper—but come up with nothing. The clothes you wear are simple: roughspun linen tunic, trousers that gather at the ankles, and worn leather sandals. Your belly gurgles softly in protest, reminding you that you haven’t eaten since… well, since before you woke up in this strange time.

Moving into the forest, you brush aside ferns and low-hanging branches. The forest floor is soft beneath your feet, scattered with pine needles and damp moss. It’s quiet, save for the distant chirr of insects and the occasional soft coo of a bird. Every so often, you catch a flicker of movement: a squirrel darting up a trunk, a small animal scurrying through the undergrowth. You wonder if you could fashion a snare, but with what tools?

There’s a stream not too far ahead—you can hear it before you see it, a gentle trickle whispering through the trees. You push through the last layers of brush and find a shallow creek winding over smooth stones. Kneeling down, you cup your hands in the cool water and drink deeply. It tastes pure, cleaner than anything you’ve had before. Thirst quenched, you notice the glint of fish darting in the current. Catching one with your bare hands would be difficult, but maybe you can craft a fishing spear.

You realize you need something sharp. Perhaps a stone knife or flint. You recall reading somewhere that in ancient times, people chipped certain kinds of rocks to form blades. Squinting at the creek bed, you look for a stone that might fracture into a workable edge. Picking up a dark, oval rock, you strike it gently against another. To your surprise, a sharp shard flakes off. Though it’s crude, you can hold it between your thumb and forefinger and it should help strip bark or cut small twigs.

Time passes, and you notice the sun tilting westward. You should hurry. Hunger still gnaws at you, and while you can survive without a proper meal for a bit, shelter feels urgent. Clouds gather at the horizon—darker ones that warn of rain. You resolve to build a lean-to, or at least find a hollow tree or a shallow cave. With your newly chipped stone, you cut through some flexible branches and gather sturdy limbs that have fallen. Some vines or long grasses might help tie them together. You find them near the stream, where tall reeds sway gently. Braiding several reeds together, you fashion a rough cord.

Working methodically, you stack and lean branches against a low-hanging tree limb, forming a rudimentary shelter. You weave twigs and leaves to create a roof that, with luck, will keep out the worst of the rain. It’s not home—far from it—but it’s a start, a place to retreat to when the sky breaks open.

Dusk approaches, painting the treetops in gold and russet hues. Just as you finish your shelter, you notice clusters of berries on a bush at the forest’s edge. You’re cautious—some could be poisonous—but as you approach, you recognize them as blackberries, large and ripe. Gathering a handful, you savor their tart sweetness, remembering how modern produce often lacked this intensity of flavor. You collect more, careful not to strip the bush entirely. Tonight, a handful of berries and fresh water will have to suffice.

As the light grows dim, you settle into your makeshift lean-to. Thoughts whirl in your head: How did you get here? Is this even real? If it’s a dream, it feels exceedingly vivid—the grit under your nails, the ache in your muscles, the taste of the berries on your tongue. You listen to the lullaby of the forest: the distant hoot of an owl, the soft rustle of leaves. You know tomorrow will bring new challenges—searching for better tools, maybe learning to light a fire. But for tonight, you are alive, sheltered, and strangely at peace, as if you’ve stepped into a chapter of history long before your time.
