you taste the first drop of rain before it falls. The air tightens, metallic and electric, as if the sky is drawing breath. Leaves turn their pale undersides, whispering warnings. A low rumble rolls through the trunks like a giant slowly waking.

You hurry along the path, but the path is no longer a path—it's a ribbon of light winding between roots that swell like sleeping animals. The trees lean closer, elegant and grave, and you realize they have faces, not carved but suggested: knots that become eyes, ridges that soften into cheekbones. When the storm breaks, it does not simply rain. The clouds unspool velvet curtains, and the rain comes in notes: bells at first, then harp strings, then soft piano keys. Each drop glows when it strikes your skin, leaving tiny constellations that fade as fast as laughter.

Wind combs your hair with cold fingers. The canopy becomes a living ceiling of green glass and shadow, trembling as lightning stitches bright cracks across the sky. Thunderlands—plush and wide—beneath your feet, turning the moss to a springy map. You walk faster, then slower, then not at all, because something is calling your name from ahead, but it sounds like your voice coming back from a long time ago.

Following the call, you find a clearing that wasn’t here before. In the center is a pond shaped like an eye, black as ink under the storm, but reflecting a different sky altogether: a calm noon-blue with lazy clouds drifting by. Rain strikes its surface without ripples. You kneel. Your reflection blinks first.

“Do you remember the way?” it asks, though its mouth doesn't move. You don’t, but your feet do. Shoes forgotten, you step onto the water. It has the firmness of a book cover, cool and slightly bendable. Each step leaves behind the faintest footprint, a silver word you can’t quite read before it dissolves.

From the treeline, a fox padded in twilight colors watches you. Its tail is made of smoke; its eyes are lanterns. It nods like a kindly librarian and turns, expecting you to follow. You do. Together you move along a path that exists only while you’re on it, and the storm follows too, but as a companion now: rain tapping out a rhythm that guides you between ferns taller than houses and boulders sleeping with moss blankets pulled up to their chins.

The fox leads you to an oak whose trunk is hollow and warm as a hearth. Inside, there is a staircase spiraling up and down at once. You choose up—why not?—and climb past shelves filled with jars of weather: a jar of first snow, a jar of August cicadas, a jar of breath held before a kiss. You unscrew one labeled “The Moment Before.” It sighs and fills the hollow with a softness that makes the thunder outside hold its tongue.

At the top, you emerge into the crown, where the leaves are wide enough to hold you like hands. There is a chair carved from lightning, still faintly glowing. You sit. The chair hums, and for a heartbeat the entire forest hums with it: the beetles in their armor, the fungus with its map of white threads, the stones whispering under the soil. You feel a thread tugging from your chest to the clouds, and you see it—thin, silver, pulling taut. The storm has hooked you on a line, and it reels you gently upward.

You rise from the chair without moving. The oak’s crown falls away like a skirt, the clearing shrinking to a coin, the path a thread, the fox a burning ember winking fondly before it vanishes in the green. The rain stops midway between earth and sky, frozen like beads on invisible strings. In the stillness, you touch one. It rings like crystal and splits into a flock of tiny birds that fly upward, becoming stars as they go.

Higher still, the storm’s belly opens, and you slip inside. It is not dark. It is a ballroom of cloud, and the chandeliers are flashes of silent lightning, and the floor is wind. Figures made of vapor drift in formal patterns, their hands cool as fog when they brush yours in greeting. Someone presses something into your palm—a seed the size of a teardrop, heavy as a promise. “Plant it,” says a voice that might be the rain’s and might be your own.

You look back through the cloud-wall and see the forest laid out in green and shadow, a hundred small brightnesses where raindrops met your skin. You pocket the seed. The storm, having shown you its secret, loosens the line and lowers you with a kindness that is almost parental.

You descend like a leaf, and when your feet touch the moss again the thunder has grown sleepy and the rain is only a fine lace. The fox returns, yawning smoke. It leads you to a patch of earth between roots that make a cradling shape. You kneel. With your fingers you press the seed into the ground, and the soil opens like a mouth learning your name.

A sprout breaks through instantly, impossibly, unfolding a single leaf shaped like the storm’s eye. It shivers once and becomes a sapling, then a slender tree with bark that smells like distant rain. You place your ear against it. Inside, you hear the sound of the moment before—the inhale, the held breath, the sweetness of it, waiting to fall.

You stand. The forest is peaceful again. The faces in the trunks look relieved. The fox curls up by the new tree and falls asleep, its smoke-tail dimming. The sky is scrubbed clean, blue as the pond’s mirror. You realize your clothes are dry, and your footprints on the water are gone.

When you begin to walk, the path is a path again. But every few steps, light glints ahead and behind, and you think, for a second, you can see yourself moving in both directions. The wind nudges your shoulder like an old friend. You keep going, and the forest keeps you, and far behind, in a jar somewhere, the storm closes its lid with a soft click and smiles.
