You groan, pushing aside sleepless thoughts and the creeping dizziness that comes with being lost. The neon lights of the city pulse above you, casting long shadows and flickering like ghosts along the rain-slicked streets. You clutch the crumpled napkin in your pocketâ€”*"Bank on Maple, 12th & Elm. On time, please. Follow me."*â€”and spin into action.

Your mind races. *Rain? I'm wearing a jacket labeled "Project Horizon." No rain suit, mysteriousâ€”maybe Iâ€¦ forgot something essential.* You glance up at the street address of the bankâ€”*12th and Elm*â€”dreamily, but your legs donâ€™t want to trust you. The street sets you squarely dead wrong. A giant trophy sign flickers in the distance: *City Awardsâ€”Winners Receiveâ€¦ Something Big.* Suddenly, something glimmers behind youâ€”a low, rhythmic hum. You turn and see a small, smoking motorcycle parked nearby. The rider taps the engine into life.

**"Wait, thatâ€™sâ€¦ not adding up."**

You step forward, noticing a scrap of paper pinned to the motorcycleâ€™s handlebarsâ€”your handwriting briefly reappearing from nowhere, with one line written clearly: *City Awards. Move fast. Parking Bay 7, northwest tower.*

You run toward it, adrenaline humming. The parking bay is a labyrinth of dim streetlights and vegetated walls. You spot the number **7** etched in the pavement. You dive back to the street, laughing softly as you zoom past, heart pounding. 

**But waitâ€¦** somethingâ€™s off. The sky isnâ€™t fully nightâ€”I can *just* see the faint glow of streetlamps outside, a single streetlight flickering like... a heartbeat. And a voice whispers from the shadows, not new, but not familiar either.

**"Youâ€™re almost there,"** it murmurs. The figure vanishes as suddenly as it came.

You stand there, breathless. The decisionâ€™s up to you.

- **Option 1:** Go to Parking Bay 7 and confront whoever leaves the clue (*the trophy, the parking number, the wheelchairâ€”no oneâ€™s there to hand it over*).
- **Option 2:** Cross the city center toward the nearest cafÃ©, where Project Horizonâ€™s team usually gathers late nightsâ€”to see if anyone saw what you sawâ€¦ or knows why youâ€™re here.
- **Option 3:** Follow the streetlight. Whispering, pulsing rhythmâ€¦ does it lead somewhere *real*?
