...and you can't move. Your feet are rooted to the plush, corporate carpet, which has suddenly become a thick, grasping mud. You try to pull your leg free, but it only sinks deeper.

Your boss, a man whose face seems to be a blurry composite of every authority figure you've ever had, taps an impatient rhythm on his watch. The watch face isn't showing numbers, but a rapidly draining hourglass. Each grain of sand that falls echoes like a gunshot in the dead-silent office.

"Well?" his voice booms, not from his mouth, but from the ceiling vents. "The project is to catalogue the whispers. All of them. The deadline is before the next silence."

You look down at your desk. Your computer is there, but the keyboard is made of soft, yielding marshmallows. When you press a key, it just squishes and sticks to your finger, smelling faintly of vanilla. The monitor is dark, but if you stare into it, you can see a faint reflection of yourself, except you're wearing a deep-sea diver's helmet.

Panic sets in. You need a pen. You fumble in a drawer, but it's filled with water. A single, sad-looking goldfish swims in a lazy circle inside it. You grab for the fish, thinking maybe you can use its fin to write, but it winks at you and dissolves into a puff of ink. The ink doesn't stain the water; it forms the words "TRY HARDER."

You look around for help. Your coworkers are all at their desks, but they're not working. They're all meticulously building houses of cards, but the cards are their own family photos. They don't look up. Their concentration is absolute. One of them, Brenda from accounting, carefully places a photo of her son on top of her precarious tower, and the entire structure collapses without a sound. She calmly begins again.

The hum from the ceiling vents gets louder. The boss's voice echoes again, "The whispers are fading! You're losing data!"

You feel a whisper tickle your ear. It sounds like rustling leaves and breaking glass. You have to write it down. You turn back to your desk, ignoring the marshmallow keys and the goldfish drawer. You see a single, forgotten coffee mug. You tip it over. The cold, black coffee spills out, but it doesn't spread across the desk. It holds its shape, solidifying into a long, dark, shimmering rectangle.

It's a door.

Without thinking, you step through the coffee-door. The pressure vanishes. The humming stops. You are no longer in the office but standing on a quiet, grey beach under a sky of twin moons. The sand beneath your feet is made of soft, silent static. Out on the water, thousands of tiny lights are bobbing, each one a captured whisper, waiting patiently.

You realize you have all the time in the world. The project is not impossible after all. You just had to find the right door. You take a deep breath, and the air smells like ozone and relief. You begin to gather the lights.
