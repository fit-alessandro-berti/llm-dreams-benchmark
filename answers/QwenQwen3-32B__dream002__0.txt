You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air grows heavy, charged with a static that makes the hairs on your arms rise. The sky, once a soft blue, darkens to a swirling indigo, and the wind begins to howl, carrying with it the scent of petrichor and something else—something sweet and metallic, like crushed berries and lightning. The trees, once still, now whisper frantically in a language just beyond comprehension, their leaves trembling as if shedding tears of silver.

You duck beneath the arch of a gnarled oak as the first raindrops fall, not as water but as shards of liquid crystal, prismatic and sharp. They strike the ground and shatter into mist, revealing faint glowing symbols etched into the soil. The storm seems alive, its breath hot and cold in turns, and you realize the clouds above are not just roiling gray but threaded with veins of gold and violet, pulsing like a heartbeat. 

Then—a voice, not from anywhere but *everywhere*, resonates in your chest: *“Follow the roots, not the path.”* You glance around and notice the forest floor shifting, roots writhing like serpents to form a tunnel beneath the moss. As you crouch to enter, a fork of lightning strikes the space you just occupied, illuminating a figure in the distance—a tall, willowy being with antlers like branching lightning, watching you.  

The tunnel swallows you whole, and suddenly you’re in a cavern aglow with bioluminescent fungi and a river of liquid starlight. The storm’s fury fades to a distant hum, and you realize the “storm” was a gate, a cleansing. Ahead, the wall of roots parts to reveal a clearing where trees grow upside down, their roots piercing the sky, and their leaves… are eyes. They open as you step forward, whispering, *“You’re late.”*  

Your dream pauses here, breathless, as the eyes begin to sing.
