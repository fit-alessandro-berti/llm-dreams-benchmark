begin to speak, but as the words tumble out, they morph into a chorus of bird songs, echoing through the hall. The audience doesn't blink; instead, they rise as one, sprouting feathers from their arms, transforming into a flock of vibrant parrots that flutter around me in a whirlwind of colors. I try to continue my speech, but now I'm perched on a branch in a vast jungle canopy, the stage dissolved into misty vines, and the parrots are repeating my garbled phrases back at me in perfect harmony. Suddenly, the ground shifts—I'm falling through the air, only to land softly on a cloud made of cotton candy, where a wise old owl (my forgotten notes, somehow alive) nods approvingly and whispers, "The real speech is in the flight." I wake up just as the flock lifts me skyward, laughing at the absurdity.
