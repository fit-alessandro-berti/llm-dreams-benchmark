You start to run. The city answers by shifting under your feet: streets unwind into copper ribbons, buildings tilt like ships, and the air hums with a street-song you almost remember. You try to recall the meeting’s address, but the name dissolves into a flock of gold birds that dives toward a door floating in midair. You slip through and find a corridor that folds into stairs that climb into the clouds and then dive into your thoughts.

Each door you open shows a different version of the moment: in one, a kind receptionist guides you with a smile; in another, a glass atrium previews past meetings; in yet another, a clock ticks both forward and backward, giving you time instead of taking it away. Time loosens and tightens like a rope braided from intention and fear, and your heartbeat settles into a patient rhythm.

A warm glow blooms at your chest, growing into a small compass that points not north but toward calm. You follow it through rooms of soft chatter and familiar faces—colleagues, mentors, even a future you—until a door labeled The Meeting opens onto a round table. Everyone you need sits there, eyeing you with quiet welcome.

You step in, take a steady breath, and wake, the dream’s map lingering in your mind—the sense that the way to be on time isn’t a location to find, but a way you choose to arrive. 

Would you like a darker, lighter, or more surreal version?
