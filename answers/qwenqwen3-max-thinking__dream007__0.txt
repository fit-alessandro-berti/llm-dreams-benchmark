...decide to step back. Not physically—your feet stay rooted to the creaky wooden floor of that old, dimly lit kitchen you used to share—but inwardly. Something shifts behind your ribs, like a door swinging open in a part of your mind you’d boarded up years ago.

Your friend’s voice is sharp, edged with betrayal, echoing off the peeling floral wallpaper. They’re saying your name like it’s a question you’ve refused to answer. And maybe you have. But in this dream-logic moment, you realize the argument isn’t really about the thing you’re shouting over—the missed birthday, the unreturned call, the secret you kept. It’s about the silence that grew between you while you were both too busy being right to notice you were becoming strangers.

So you stop. Mid-sentence. Mid-breath.

You look at them—not at their anger, but at the tired curve of their shoulder, the way their hands won’t stop twisting the hem of their sweater, the almost invisible scar above their eyebrow from that bike crash when you were twelve. You remember carrying them home, their blood mixing with the summer dust on your palms.

“I’m scared,” you say. The words feel foreign, clumsy, but honest. “I’m scared I’ve lost you.”

The room goes still. Outside, rain begins to fall—not the gentle kind, but a sudden, drenching downpour that rattles the windowpanes. Your friend’s eyes widen, not with softening, but with recognition. They take a shaky breath and whisper, “Me too.”

And then the dream does what dreams do: the kitchen walls dissolve into mist, the rain turns warm as bathwater, and you’re both standing ankle-deep in a river that wasn’t there a second ago—clear, cold, and flowing toward a horizon made of gold light. You don’t speak. You just wade in, side by side, letting the current carry the weight of everything you couldn’t say.
