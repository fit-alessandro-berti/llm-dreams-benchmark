...each group seems to orbit a different, quiet center of gravity.

The first group is laughing uproariously around a man who is silently juggling three ripe, fuzzy peaches. When you try to edge closer, the laughter swells, a warm but impenetrable wall of sound, and you move on.

The second cluster is murmuring in a language you almost recognize—it sounds like your childhood, but the words are made of water and dissolve before you can grasp them. One woman turns her head, and her eyes are full of quiet, friendly stars, but she doesn’t see you.

The third circle is perfectly still, a tableau of people in 1920s flapper dresses and zoot suits, frozen mid-dance under a single, spinning disco ball that casts no light. Their smiles are beautiful and vacant. You realize you’ve been holding your breath.

You feel a pang of longing for your one familiar face, a锚 point in this shifting sea. You turn a corner and find them.

But they are not alone. They are at the heart of the largest group, and they are… changed. They are taller, their laughter is the rich, commanding sound of the first group’s juggler. They are wearing a sleek, silver suit that seems to drink the room’s light. They are telling a story, and every person in the circle is leaning in, captivated, their faces reflecting not the room, but the shimmering, story-world your friend is building with their words.

They glance up and see you. A flicker of your old, familiar self crosses their face—a quick, warm smile. But then the storyteller’s mask settles back, deeper and more compelling. They give a slight, almost imperceptible shake of their head, not in denial, but in *warning*. Their eyes say: *You can’t come into this story. It’s too good. You’ll ruin the spell.*

And you understand. You are not a character in their dream. You are the dreamer, lost in the architecture of their brilliance. Your only connection is the memory of who they were before this party, before this story consumed them whole.

You nod back, a small, sad understanding. You don’t approach. You let yourself be absorbed by the ambient noise of the room, just another face in the crowd, watching the best storyteller at the party weave a world so perfect no one who knew them before would ever dare to interrupt it. The dream doesn’t end. It just settles around you, the hum of a thousand conversations, and the singular, brilliant pulse of a story you can hear, but never again enter.
