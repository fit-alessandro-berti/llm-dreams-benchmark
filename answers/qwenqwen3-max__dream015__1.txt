...decide to tend a garden.

It started with a single seed—tucked inside a rusted tin you’d scavenged from the skeletal remains of an old grocery store. Sunflower, the label read, faded but legible. You’d almost tossed it—what use was beauty in a world that barely fed itself? But something in you, some stubborn ember beneath the ash of survival, whispered: *plant it anyway.*

So you did. In a cracked ceramic pot salvaged from a toppled windowsill, you mixed dust with rainwater and a handful of composted ash from your last fire. You planted the seed like a promise.

Days turned brittle. Raiders prowled the outskirts. The wind carried whispers of plague from the southern wastes. But every morning, before the sun crested the broken skyline, you knelt by that pot. Watered it with your rationed cup. Shielded it from the acid rains with a shard of plexiglass. Sang to it in a voice hoarse from silence.

Then—green.

A tiny curl of life, defiant against the gray. You cried then, though you hadn’t cried since the Collapse.

Word got out. Not through radios or networks—those were long dead—but through the quiet network of survivors who still remembered kindness. A woman with a limp brought you a scrap of burlap to shade your sprout. A boy, no older than ten, gifted you three dried beans wrapped in foil. “For next season,” he mumbled, eyes darting like birds.

Your garden grew—not just sunflowers, but tomatoes from smuggled seeds, kale thriving in tire planters, even a struggling apple sapling nursed from a core. You built walls not of steel, but of woven branches and hope. And others came. Not to take. To *help*.

One evening, as fireflies blinked like fallen stars among the bean trellises, you realized: the apocalypse hadn’t ended. But neither had you. And in this cracked world, you’d planted something rarer than bullets or clean water.

You’d planted tomorrow.
