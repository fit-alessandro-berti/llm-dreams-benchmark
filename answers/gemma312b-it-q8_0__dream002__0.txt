You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weathered changed dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and…the trees start to sing. Not in a whimsical, "fairy tale" way, but in a resonant, mournful drone that vibrates straight to your teeth. The wind picks up, howling not just across branches, and *from* them, weaving complex harmonies with the woody voice of the foliage.

The sky, moments earlier a dappled green, turns a bruised purple – almost indigo. Raindrops, immense and strangely soft, begin to cascade down. It isn's cold rain. This felt...warm. Like melted amethysts falling on your face. 

As the singing deepens, the forest floor begins to undulate. The root tendrils beneath you lift, shift, and then *move.* The familiar undergrowth—ferns and berry bushes—twist into serpentine shapes, writhing almost playfully but undeniably living with a newly revealed intelligence. They reach out, not attacking or threatening, but offering—tangle of vines and velvety moss –  towards you. 



A voice breaks through the chorus--not quite audible *heard*, but felt intensely within your chest, "Welcome, dreamer. The forest remembers.”



You reach out nervously to touch one of these twisting roots–and suddenly you’re not *you* anymore. Not entirely. Your limbs stretch and elongate, bark subtly forming upon your skin, and leaves unfurl from your fingertips, catching the warm violet rain.



You were now a tree. Connected. Rooted in place beside all the others that sing this strange, profound symphony; your own wooden voice adding subtly, yet resonantly to the song. 



And you understand. This storm isn't an ending.<0xC2><0xA0>But a return. To where you're truly from. You look forward into the violet downpour and see figures of light moving through the forest, beings made entirely of the luminous rain, greeting your newfound form with a radiant embrace.



Your dream dissolves with an echo the deepest note in the harmonic chorus–a lullaby whispered by an ancient, living woods.



You wake up. Covered in dew...and inexplicably smelling a little like moss and rain.
