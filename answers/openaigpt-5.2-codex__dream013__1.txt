…begin to notice the walls shifting as if they’re listening, the puzzles rearranging themselves each time you blink. The more you solve, the quieter everything becomes, until even your footsteps seem to be absorbed by the maze. Symbols you don’t remember learning drift across the stone, and each answer unlocks a memory you didn’t know you had—a childhood smell, a distant laugh, a name on the tip of your tongue.

At the center, you find a round chamber with no doors, only a mirror-like pool on the floor. The final riddle is written in ripples: *What is the only way out?* As you lean closer, the reflection isn’t the maze but your sleeping face. Understanding rises like a tide, and you whisper, “To wake.” The pool brightens into a doorway of light, the maze dissolves, and you open your eyes in your own room, the echo of the puzzles still lingering like a half-remembered song.
