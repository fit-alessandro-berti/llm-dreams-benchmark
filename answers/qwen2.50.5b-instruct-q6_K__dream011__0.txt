It seems like there may be something off. Can you please clarify exactly which answers and concepts have been discussed or given in your previous exams? This information could help me provide an insightful suggestion.
If it is a mathematics course, here are some general tips for performing on final exams: first read the entire question carefully; then make sure to understand any key points and how they are presented in the question. It's also helpful if you can write down your thoughts or questions at the margins of your work so that this information will be easily accessible when solving similar problems later on.
If it is a science class, here are some general tips for preparing: first read the syllabus and understand what concepts to expect; then create an outline of your notes for each key topic. This can help you remember important ideas quickly during exams by creating a visual map or graph. It's also helpful if you can identify any specific formulas or algorithms that you will need to solve problems later on.
I'm also available 24/7 and always ready to assist with all sorts of questions, whether they require deep knowledge, broad understanding, or just some general advice!

Please let me know how I can help further.
