You find yourself in a post‑apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to follow the faint, rhythmic pulse of a distant drum—a sound that seems to echo from beneath the ruined streets, like a heartbeat that refuses to die. You move through the skeletal shell of a city swallowed by vines, past the skeletal remains of cars that hiss with rust. The wind carries the scent of wet concrete and burnt metal, and the sky is a bruised purple, pierced here and there by the pale, indifferent stars.

At the edge of a derelict square, the drum grows louder, and the air shimmers with a strange, phosphorescent glow. It leads you to an abandoned subway entrance, half-buried under a mound of rubble. The iron door creaks open with a sigh, and you step into darkness that is suddenly alive with a low, humming resonance—like the pulse of a heart that is alive, not just echoing an old beat. The deeper you go, the clearer the light becomes: it is not a physical light, but a soft, warm glow that seems to seep from the walls themselves, as if the station was built from some kind of living stone.

Inside, the cavernous tunnel is lined with panels of old glass, half shattered but still holding faint glimmers of color. As you walk, the panels flicker, casting kaleidoscopic images on your path. The drum’s rhythm synchronizes with your own pulse, and you realize you are not just in a dream; you are part of its architecture. On the far wall, a map materializes—etched into glass and illuminated by the very light that guides you. The map is not of streets or territories; it is a map of memories—your own recollections of a life that once felt ordinary and now feels like a distant, fragile echo.

Your eyes adjust to the surreal landscape, and you find yourself at a crossroads of paths, each marked with different symbols: a broken gear for technology, an open hand for cooperation, a flame for survival. As you decide which path to take, a sudden gust of wind swirls around you, bringing with it the scent of rain and fresh earth. The drum stops. Silence falls, heavy and expectant. In that silence you hear the faint whisper of your own name, spoken from the depths of the tunnel as if by an old friend or a forgotten voice you once heard.

You stand at the intersection, and the decision you make is not a simple choice between survival and despair, but something larger. The dream—your dream—asks you: Will you rebuild? Will you let the light that has guided you become a beacon for others? Or will you retreat into the darkness, leaving the drum's pulse to echo in the ruins forever?

Before you can answer, the world around you swirls, the walls of the tunnel dissolving into a swirl of colors like the inside of a jellyfish. And in that instant, you awaken, breath quickening, heart pounding with a rhythm that feels like the distant drum you heard in the dream, carrying with it a promise that even in the darkest, desolate world, a faint, steady light can guide you forward.
