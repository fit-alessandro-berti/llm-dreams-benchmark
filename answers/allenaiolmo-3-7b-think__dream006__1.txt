**Completed Dream:**  

As you step onto the stage, the spotlight narrows to a single beam on your trembling hands. The crowd’s murmurs rise like a tidal wave, but your voice catches—*“Uh… um…”* You fumble with the words, the words you’ve rehearsed a thousand times now feeling foreign. A flicker of doubt: *What if I’m not ready?* Just as the silence stretches, a memory surfaces—your younger self, standing here years ago, delivering a speech that changed the room. The words you once spoke with hesitation now flood your mind, sharp and clear.  

Suddenly, the air hums. The dim stage lights pulse like a heartbeat, and the crowd’s faces shift into radiant, expectant smiles. You take a breath, and your voice steadies, rising with a newfound clarity. *“We are not here to listen,”* you say, and the words hang in the air like a challenge. The audience leans forward, their whispers merging into a single, resonant chorus. As you speak, the room begins to *bloom*: flowers burst from the floor, petals spiraling upward in time with your sentences. A child in the front row raises their hands, and their palms glow with light, scattering it across the crowd like confetti.  

You realize, with dawning awe, that your words are not just heard—they’re *felt*. Fear in the room dissolves into courage, doubt into hope. The stage dissolves too, replaced by a sunlit meadow where the audience now stands as equals, their faces alight with shared purpose. You finish your speech—not as a speaker, but as a bridge. The final sentence lingers: *“Together, we are more than we seem.”*  

As the words fade, the meadow transforms into a constellation, and you wake with the scent of jasmine on your lips, the crowd’s laughter echoing in your dreams.
