gladly accept their help. They lead you through winding alleyways illuminated by glowing neon signs, their laughter and chatter comforting amidst the overwhelming noise of the city.  

As you walk, the buildings begin to shift and stretch, their windows shimmering like pools of liquid light. The strangers don’t seem to notice, so you say nothing, trusting them to guide you.  

Eventually, you reach a small, hidden garden nestled between two towering skyscrapers. It’s impossibly serene—soft lanterns floating in the air, flowers blooming in colors you’ve never seen before. One of the strangers hands you a delicate key made of silver and glass.  

“This is yours,” they say with a knowing smile.  

You hesitate. “What does it open?”  

They gesture toward a door at the far end of the garden. It wasn’t there a moment ago. The door is carved with symbols that seem familiar, yet you can’t quite place them.  

Taking a deep breath, you step forward and insert the key. The lock clicks open, and as you push the door ajar, a brilliant light spills out. It feels warm, inviting. The strangers nod in encouragement.  

With one last glance back, you step inside—and find yourself standing in a place that feels both completely new and deeply familiar.  

What happens next?
