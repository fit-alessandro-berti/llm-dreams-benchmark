...venture toward the rusted skeleton of a library, its dome cracked like an eggshell against the ashen sky. The last canned peaches were gone a week ago, but books… books could still be found here, their pages brittle but legible. You clutch a salvaged pipe—more for comfort than defense—and step through the shattered entrance.

Dust motes dance in the faint light filtering through the broken stained glass. The air smells of damp paper and decay. You’re not here for novels or poetry. You’re here for the blueprints—the old manuals on water filtration, basic medicine, renewable energy. Knowledge is the only resource that doesn’t spoil.

Your boot scuffs something metallic. A journal, half-buried under fallen masonry. The cover is scorched, but the words inside are handwritten, steady. The last entry reads: *"If anyone finds this, the river south is poisoned. Do not drink. Follow the railroad tracks east—there’s a spring behind the old train depot. Build slow. Trust few."*

A faint skittering echoes from the stacks. Something is awake in the dark. You tighten your grip on the pipe. The journal feels heavier than any weapon.

You have two paths:  
1. **Search the reference section**—risk deeper silence for the water filtration diagrams you desperately need.  
2. **Head straight to the east wing**—follow the journal’s warning, find the railroad tracks, and escape before whatever lives in the shelves finds you.

What do you do?
