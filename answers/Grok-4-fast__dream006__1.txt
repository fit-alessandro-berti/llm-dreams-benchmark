begin to speak, but instead of words, out comes a cascade of glittering fireflies that swirl into the air like living punctuation marks, spelling out ancient riddles only the front row can decipher. The audience gasps, then leans in closer, their faces illuminated in a soft, pulsing glow. I try to clear my throat—poof!—a flock of origami cranes bursts from my mouth, folding themselves mid-flight into tiny airplanes that buzz around the rafters, dropping confetti made of forgotten childhood memories.

Panic sets in, or is it exhilaration? I wave my arms to conduct the chaos, and suddenly the stage tilts like a funhouse mirror, transforming the podium into a grand piano. My fingers, now elongated like willow branches, dance across the keys, playing a symphony that's half Beethoven, half the hum of distant stars. The crowd doesn't applaud; they join in, their voices weaving harmonies that lift the entire auditorium into the night sky, where we float among constellations that wink like old friends.

But dreams, as you know, have a way of unraveling at the edges. The stars start to unravel too, threading into a vast tapestry that drapes over us all, pulling me gently back to wakefulness. As the fabric settles, I hear a faint echo: "Encore?" And just like that, the curtain falls—or rises?—leaving me wondering if speeches were ever meant to be spoken at all. What happens next in your version of the dream?
