**The Dream Continues:**

The air grows thick with the scent of damp earth and ozone, the kind of smell that clings to your skin like a warning. The trees around you, once whispering in the breeze, now stand rigid, their leaves trembling as if bracing for a blow. A gust of wind howls through the canopy, sending a shower of golden leaves spiraling down like embers from a dying fire.

Then—**the first drop**.

It hits your cheek, cold and heavy, not the gentle patter of rain but the sharp, insistent *thud* of something larger. You look up. The sky has split open. Not with the usual gray storm clouds, but with a **swirling mass of violet and black**, like ink spilled across a canvas. The wind screams now, a sound that vibrates in your bones, and the trees groan as if in pain.

You run.

The forest is no longer peaceful. The path beneath your feet has turned to **slippery mud**, sucking at your boots with every step. Branches lash out like skeletal fingers, snapping in the wind. Ahead, the trees thin into a clearing—but it’s not a clearing at all. It’s a **mouth**.

A vast, jagged chasm yawns before you, its edges lined with teeth of rock and fang-like stalactites. The storm rages above, but the chasm is **dry**. Too dry. The air inside hums with a low, resonant tone, like a held breath. And then you see them:

**Figures.**

Silhouettes moving just beyond the edge of the light, their forms shifting between human and something else—something with too many limbs, too many eyes, their bodies woven from shadows and smoke. They don’t walk. They **flow**, like liquid given shape, their movements unnatural, as if they’re not bound by the same rules as you.

One turns its head toward you.

Its face is smooth, featureless—except for a **single vertical slit** where a mouth should be. It opens, and a sound comes out, not a voice but a **vibration**, a wordless question that makes your teeth ache.

You should run. You *know* you should run.

But your feet won’t move.

Because the storm isn’t just outside.

It’s **inside you now**.

The wind howls in your ears, but it’s also the sound of your own breath, ragged and uneven. The rain is cold on your skin, but it’s also the sweat of fear. And the figures—they’re not just in the chasm.

They’re **in the trees**.

You reach out, and your fingers brush bark—only to find it **soft**, like skin. The tree leans toward you, its branches curling like fingers, and when you pull back, your palm is stained with **dark sap**.

Then the ground gives way.

Not all at once—just a crack, a single fissure widening beneath your feet. You stumble, and the world tilts. The chasm yawns wider, and the figures **laugh**, a sound like cracking ice, like the snapping of too many bones at once.

You fall.

But as you drop, the storm **stops**.

The wind dies. The rain halts midair. The figures freeze.

And you realize—

You’re not falling.

You’re **flying**.

The forest rushes past below, the trees shrinking into a tapestry of green and brown. The chasm is just a scratch on the earth now. The storm is gone.

But you’re not alone.

Something is **with you**.

A shape, warm and solid, wraps around your waist. You turn—and see a figure made of **light**, its edges shimmering like sunlight through water. It smiles, and its teeth are stars.

*"You were never meant to stay,"* it says, and its voice is the sound of your own heartbeat.

Then the world dissolves into color.

**How would you like to end it?**
- **Awaken** (gasping, drenched in sweat, the storm still raging outside your window)?
- **Keep falling** (into a dream within a dream, where the light-figure reveals it’s *you* from another life)?
- **The figures take you** (the chasm closes behind you, and you wake up… somewhere else entirely)?
- **Something else?** (Your call!)
