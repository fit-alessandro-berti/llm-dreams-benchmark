...and you open your mouth to shout orders, to project calm, but the sound that comes out isn't your voice. It's the melancholic song of a lone whale, echoing strangely *above* the roar of the wind and waves.

The deck beneath your feet suddenly feels soft, yielding, like moss. You look down and see it *is* moss, thick and green, pulsing with a faint light. The rain stinging your face isn't cold saltwater, but warm, sweet honey. Your crew doesn't flinch from it; they turn their faces up, mouths open slightly, catching the drops with expressions shifting from terror to a strange, dazed wonder.

The storm doesn't lessen, but its nature changes. The waves crashing against the hull sound like applause, rhythmic and expectant. The lightning illuminating the sky isn't jagged forks, but slow, deliberate brushstrokes of vibrant colour – purple, gold, emerald – painting fleeting pictures of impossible coastlines and cities built from clouds across the churning black canvas.

One of your crew members, the grizzled first mate with barnacles somehow growing in his beard, points not at a rogue wave, but *upwards*. Following his gaze, you see the stars aren't hidden by the storm clouds. Instead, the clouds *are* the stars, swirling nebulae of unimaginable depth, and the ship isn't sailing on water anymore, but drifting *through* them.

You grip the ship's wheel, which now feels like cool, smooth stone etched with constellations you don't recognize. The fear hasn't vanished, but it's morphed into profound awe and a dizzying sense of responsibility not just for the ship, but for navigating this impossible, beautiful, terrifying cosmos. You take a breath, tasting honey and starlight, and turn the wheel, unsure if you're steering towards doom or destiny, only knowing you must steer *somewhere*. The whale song resonates from your chest again, the true command for this unearthly voyage.
