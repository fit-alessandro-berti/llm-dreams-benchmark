**Dream Continuation:**

You take a deep breath, your voice steady despite the tension, and say, *"I don’t want to fight anymore. Let’s talk about it like adults."* Your friend hesitates, their eyes flickering between you and the doorway where a third person—someone you haven’t seen in years—stands, arms crossed. They look familiar, but you can’t quite place them. The air between you shifts, charged with something older than the argument.

*"You know,"* the stranger says, voice low, *"this isn’t just about what you’re saying right now. It’s about what you’ve both been holding back."* Before you can respond, the room starts to blur. The walls stretch, the floor tilts, and suddenly, you’re not in the living room anymore—you’re standing in a vast, shifting landscape of floating islands, each one a memory or a possibility. Your friend is here too, but they’re not the same person you knew. Their voice is hollow, echoing: *"We’ve been running from the truth for so long."*

A voice—deep, like thunder—cuts through the silence. *"You were never meant to choose sides."* The ground beneath you cracks open, revealing a spiral staircase descending into darkness. At the bottom, a figure waits: a version of yourself from a time you’ve forgotten, their hands outstretched. *"We were never meant to fight,"* they whisper. *"We were meant to see the same light."*

The dream fades as you wake up, your heart pounding. The argument with your friend lingers in your mind, but now it feels less like a conflict and more like a shadow of something unresolved. Outside your window, the streetlights flicker—just like the dream’s last image.
