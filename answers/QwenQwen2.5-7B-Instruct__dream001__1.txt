wander through the bustling streets, trying to orient yourself. The buildings are tall and modern, with towering glass skyscrapers reflecting the twilight sky. The city seems to be divided into distinct sections, each with its own unique architecture and atmosphere.

As you pass by a food stand, you're mesmerized by a mouth-watering aroma of spices and smoke. Before you can make up your mind to taste the food, a local rushes past you, looking slightly panicked. She grabs your arm and whispers, "Follow me, quick!" before dragging you into a narrow alleyway and up a staircase hidden by a tapestry. 

You both slip into a small room, painted in dark reds and golds. The walls are adorned with intricate patterns and ancient symbols. A man in a formal robe steps forward, insisting you must have been meant to be here. He explains that the city you are in is not the one you originally intended—this place is a dreamscape, created as a test or challenge.

Realizing the gravity of the situation, you must now find the path to your true meeting. The man hands you a small scroll and charges you with a quest—each step on the path requires you to solve a riddle or face a small obstacle. If you succeed, you will maintain your journey; if not, you may be lost forever.

You tentatively open the scroll and read the first riddle aloud: "I am always hungry, I must always be fed. The finger I touch, will soon turn red. What am I?"

You think for a moment and say, "Fire!" The man nods, pleased, and the way to continue your path opens up before you. With renewed determination, you set off towards the meeting, each riddle a step towards your true destination.
