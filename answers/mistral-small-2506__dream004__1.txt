As you approach the blank canvas, you notice it’s not just any ordinary surface—it pulses faintly, as if alive. The edges shimmer with an iridescent glow, and when you reach out to touch it, your fingers pass through the fabric of reality itself.

Suddenly, the canvas *responds*. A single, vibrant stroke of indigo appears, swirling into a shape that resembles a door. Before you can react, the door swings open, revealing a hallway of shifting colors—each step you take alters the hues around you. The walls breathe, expanding and contracting like lungs, and the floor beneath you ripples like liquid.

At the end of the hallway, a figure stands—vague and shifting, its form flickering between human and something else entirely. It doesn’t speak, but you *understand* it. It’s waiting for you to choose: will you step through the door it holds, or will you turn back and let the canvas erase your presence entirely?

The air hums with possibility. The dream is yours to shape. What do you do?
