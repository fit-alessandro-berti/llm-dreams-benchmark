**Dream Sequence:**

You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you—

**…stare at the screen, your fingers frozen mid-keyboard. The room tilts slightly, as if the floor has become a wave. The deadline is tomorrow, but the project is something you’ve never done before. Your boss leans in with an expectant smile.**

*"You’ve got this,"* they say, though their voice sounds like it’s coming from underwater.

Your hands hover over the keyboard, but the letters on the screen rearrange themselves into hieroglyphics. The noise of the office fades into a low hum, and you realize—*you’re not alone.* A shadowy figure sits at the empty desk across from you, typing furiously, though no one else can see them. They glance over and wink.

*"Relax. Just follow the pattern."*

You watch as their fingers move in a strange, rhythmic dance across the keys. The hieroglyphics on your screen shift, forming a path of glowing symbols. One by one, you mirror their motions—

**And then you wake up.**

The voice of your alarm clock blares, and you sit up in bed, drenched in sweat. The project is real. The deadline is real. And as you reach for your phone, a notification pops up:

*"Project Update: Due Date Extended (by Dream Logic)."*

You exhale, but the unease lingers. Somewhere in the back of your mind, the shadowy figure is still typing.

**What do you do next?**

(Would you like to continue the dream or wake up for real?)
