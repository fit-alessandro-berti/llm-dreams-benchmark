You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panic, your heart quickening as you glance around at towering Art Deco buildings that seem to stretch into a purple-tinged sky. The streets are empty, lined with old-fashioned lampposts that emit a soft, golden glow despite the sun still hovering low on the horizon.

You check your pockets and find only a crumpled piece of paper. Unfolding it reveals an address written in handwriting you don't recognize: "The Hall of Forgotten Promises, Third Corner of Memory and Regret." The words make no sense, yet they feel urgent, critical.

You begin walking, your footsteps echoing strangely loud on the cobblestone. The city shifts around you—buildings morphing their facades, street signs rearranging themselves as you pass. A fountain appears in the middle of an intersection, water flowing upward into the clouds. A cat with too many eyes watches you from a windowsill but doesn't move.

A stranger in a gray coat materializes beside you. "You look lost," they say, their voice sounding like it comes from underwater.

"The Hall of Forgotten Promises," you say, showing them the paper.

Their expression flickers between pity and something like relief. "Ah, the meeting. It's not far—but you must remember why you're there. The building only appears to those who recall."

You open your mouth to answer, but suddenly you're not sure. Why is this meeting important? Who are you meeting? The dream begins to fray at the edges, colors bleeding together like watercolor, and you feel yourself slipping toward waking with the answer just beyond reach.
