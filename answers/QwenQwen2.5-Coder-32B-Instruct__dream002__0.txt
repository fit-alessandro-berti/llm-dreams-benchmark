The sky darkens, and the air grows cold and heavy around you. A strong wind starts howling as if warning you to leave, but you find yourself strangely rooted to the spot, unable to turn back. 

Suddenly, the first fat raindrops strike the leaves, and then quickly turn into a torrential downpour, pelting you from above. The wind whips through the trees with ferocity, sending branches crashing to the ground and uprooting shrubs.

In the midst of this chaos, a fearsome beast emerges from the undergrowth. It is a massive creature, covered in dark, shaggy fur and piercing red eyes that seem to see straight through you. Its presence is overwhelming, and you freeze in terror as it lumbers towards you.

But as you stand there, you realize that the creature's eyes, though appearing fierce, also hold a strange intelligence. It seems to be communicating with you, somehow. You try to shout for help, but your voice is lost in the storm's howling.

Instead, you feel drawn to the creature, as if it holds some kind of ancient wisdom. You extend a trembling hand towards its snout, and to your surprise, it nuzzles against you affectionately. 

The storm begins to calm, the rain turning to a gentle patter on the leaves. The beast leads you deeper into the forest, towards a clearing at the heart of the woods. As you reach it, the storm dissipates completely, revealing a beautiful glade.

In the center of the glade is an ancient stone altar, covered in strange symbols and etchings. As you approach the altar, you realize that the beast has disappeared, and in its place is the image of an elderly, wise man. He looks down at you, his eyes kind but knowing.

"You have been chosen," he says in a voice that resonates through the entirety of the glade. "You are the one who will restore balance to the forest and bring peace to all who inhabit it."
