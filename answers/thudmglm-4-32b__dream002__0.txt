Above, the sky, previously a clear canvass of soft blue, darkens rapidly, turning a deep, oppressive grey that seems to swallow the light. The scent of damp earth and ozone hangs heavy in the air. You quicken your pace, glancing back uneasily at the faint outline of the path disappearing into the deepening gloom. Then, a sharp crack of thunder vibrates deep in your bones, closer than you expected. You see the first angry flashes of lightning fork violently across the now terrifyingly darkened sky, illuminating the towering trees around you in stark, unnerving relief. The storm has arrived, and it's closer than you ever imagined.
