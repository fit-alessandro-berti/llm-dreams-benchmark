 ...the walls begin to breathe.

Not metaphorically—though at first I thought it was just the flickering torchlight playing tricks. But no, the stone corridors are actually expanding and contracting, slow and rhythmic, like the ribcage of some sleeping giant. The puzzles change too. What began as mechanical conundrums—gear alignments and mirror reflections—morph into something more fluid. 

I encounter a door that opens only when I remember the exact pitch of my mother's voice calling me home for dinner when I was seven. The corridor ahead requires me to solve an equation where the variables are not numbers, but regrets I haven't yet acknowledged. I input the solutions with trembling fingers, and the floorboards creak approval.

At the center—because there is always a center in dreams like this—I find not a treasure or an exit, but a chair. It faces a mirror. In the reflection, the maze is empty, and I realize with that strange, water-logic that comes in sleep, that I've been both the one solving the puzzles and the architect who set them. Every dead end was a memory I walled off; every correct turn, a compromise I made with myself.

I sit down. The maze begins to dissolve at the edges, bleeding into gray static. The final puzzle presents itself: a simple question written in condensation on the mirror's surface—"*Will you remember this when you wake?*" 

I reach out to trace the answer, but my hand passes through the glass, and the maze exhales one last time, pushing me gently upward, upward, through layers of consciousness, until the riddles unravel into morning sunlight and the ticking of my real alarm clock.
