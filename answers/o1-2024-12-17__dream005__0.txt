You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people, each with its own distinct energy. The first group you approach is huddled around a low table decorated with intricate, twisting patterns of gold and deep emerald green. Their voices overlap in a soft hum, as if each speaker is trying to carefully weave their words into a shared tapestry of meaning. When you step closer, they pause to look at you—not with suspicion, but with an expectant, quiet warmth. They seem to know you have a question, and you realize you’ve forgotten what it is. Unable to remember, you bow slightly and move on.

In the next circle, you notice a cluster of tall figures wearing flowing robes and masks with gentle, smiling faces painted on them. Their laughter rings out in bell-like tones. You think they might be old friends from childhood—though that doesn’t make sense, as you cannot recall when you knew people who wore such outfits. One of them steps forward and offers you a bright orange fruit you’ve never seen before. It looks like a persimmon, yet it shimmers as if it’s made of stained glass. You accept it politely but do not eat it. Instead, you tuck it into a pocket you don’t recall having, and thank them. They nod, as if this exchange was expected, and return to their murmuring.

A few steps away, there’s a group arranged in a perfect circle, standing equidistant from one another. The circle seems almost too perfect to be accidental. The individuals there are dressed in stark whites and blacks, and one wears a cape of polished metal plates that reflect the lantern light overhead. The rest watch you calmly, and as you come closer, they shuffle sideways, rotating the circle until you are standing at its center. You can’t tell if they’ve imprisoned you or merely included you. From this vantage point, the entire gathering looks different—more like a single organism composed of countless smaller beings. You try to spot the one person you know in the crowd, but from here, everyone’s features blur in a shimmer of candle glow and distant laughter.

You break away, hurrying toward a raised platform draped in red velvet. People lounge on the steps leading up to it, some half-asleep, others whispering to each other in voices that never rise above a hush. The platform holds a small band playing instruments made of glass tubes and hollow wooden spheres. The music they produce is soothing yet irregular, like wind chimes caught in a gentle breeze. As you watch, the sound draws out vivid memories you didn’t realize you were carrying: a beach at twilight, the taste of honey, a letter you once meant to send but never did. You look down at your hands and realize you are holding that same letter now, sealed with a wax stamp bearing the initials of the one friend you’re searching for.

With renewed purpose, you descend from the platform and wander deeper into the gathering. At the far edge of the space, beneath softly swinging paper lanterns, you see a figure leaning against a wooden pillar, half-illuminated by flickering light. You don’t even need to see their face to know it’s the person you’ve been seeking. Relief washes over you as you approach, the sealed letter still in your hands.

As you draw near, your friend turns, smiling knowingly, as if aware of every winding path you took through this place to reach them. Their eyes reflect the lantern light, and you sense you’ve arrived at the center of something important—something the dream has been building toward.

They open their arms in welcome. You hold out the letter. Just before your fingers release it, the sound of the distant band fades, and the groups you passed begin to dissolve into a swirling, watercolor blur. Your friend’s image wavers too, but leaves you with a final, comforting whisper: “You have not lost anything. You are simply learning how to find what matters.”

Then, as if carried away on a gentle wind, the entire scene evaporates into a calm and endless silence.
