You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to *find water*—not just any water, but the sacred spring rumored to be guarded by the Stone Weavers, the blind artisans who carve time into limestone.

The air smells of damp earth and woodsmoke. Around you, a village of thatched huts clings to the side of a mist-shrouded hill. People wear wool and linen, their faces weathered by sun and wind. No one speaks the tongue you know, but their eyes widen when you touch the locket around your neck—the one you didn’t remember putting on. It hums faintly, warm against your skin.

A boy, no older than ten, tugs your sleeve and points toward the mountains. He says one word, repeated like a chant: *“Aerthys.”*

You follow.

The path winds upward, slick with moss. When you reach the cliff’s edge, you see it: a spring bubbling from the belly of a colossal monolith, its surface swirling with faint, glowing runes. Around it, figures in hooded robes move in silence, chiseling symbols into the rock—not decorations, but *records*. Each groove pulses with light as they finish, then fades into the stone like a breath held too long.

One of the Weavers turns to you. Their eyes are milky white, yet they seem to see straight through you.

*“You are out of time,”* they whisper, not in words but in images that bloom inside your mind: your bedroom, your phone flat on the pillow, your own face asleep—unmoving, unconscious.

*“The spring remembers those who fall through cracks,”* they say. *“But to return, you must give something only the present拥有的.*”

You clutch your locket tighter. You know what they mean.

You have to give them a memory you can’t afford to lose.

The wind howls. The runes flare.

And you realize—if you choose wisely—you might not come back the same.

But if you don't choose at all…

…you’ll vanish like all the others.

The Weaver holds out a chisel.

And asks you: *“What will you trade for a sunrise you already forgot?”*
