a paintbrush hovering in mid-air, dripping with liquid starlight. Intrigued, you grasp it, and the moment your fingers touch the handle, the canvas awakens.

Vibrant hues explode from your first stroke—a crimson wave crashing into emerald forests that twist into impossible spirals. Shapes morph beneath your hand: a flock of geometric birds takes flight, their wings folding into fractals that whisper secrets of forgotten galaxies. Laughter echoes from sapphire clouds as they rain down melodies, painting your skin with glowing runes that pulse with your heartbeat.

Deeper you delve, the canvas expanding infinitely. Mountains of molten gold rise and crumble into oceans of whispering silk, where fish with human eyes swim in schools of living poetry. Your reflections multiply—endless versions of you, dancing, warring, loving in a symphony of chaos.

But as the dream peaks, the canvas turns the tables. Ink-black tendrils snake from the edges, wrapping around you gently, pulling you through the fabric of reality. You tumble into a void of pure potential, weightless and free, until a soft dawn light filters in.

You awaken, the echo of colors lingering on your fingertips, the blank canvas now etched forever in your mind.
