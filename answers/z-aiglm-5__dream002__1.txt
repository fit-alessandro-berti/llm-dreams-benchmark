...the light shifts from a dappled green to a bruised, electric violet. The birds stop singing instantly, replaced by a low, vibrating hum that seems to emanate from the ground beneath your feet.

You try to turn back, but the path has vanished, replaced by a wall of twisting vines that weren't there a moment ago. The trees, once sturdy oaks and pines, begin to sway violently, their bark peeling away to reveal glowing, translucent wood underneath. The wind doesn't howl; it whispers, a thousand voices speaking in a language you almost understand but can’t quite grasp.

Suddenly, the sky tears open. But it isn't rain that falls. Large, heavy silver flakes drift down, clinking softly like metal when they hit the ground. You reach out to catch one, and as it touches your palm, it doesn't melt—it hovers. You realize with a jolt that gravity has reversed. The forest floor begins to crumble away into a deep, starry abyss below, leaving you standing on a floating island of soil and glowing roots, drifting upward into the eye of the storm.
