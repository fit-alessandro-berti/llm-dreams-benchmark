You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to find water—fast.

Your throat is parched, your lips cracked, and the morning sun hangs heavy and golden over a landscape of rolling wheat fields and wooden cottages with thatched roofs. No billboards. No smartphones. No hum of electricity. Just the creak of windmills, the distant lowing of cattle, and the rhythmic clack of a woman’s wooden clogs on a dirt path.

You follow the sound of running water and stumble upon a stone well crowned with a hand-cranked pulley. An old woman in a faded blue apron draws a bucket with practiced ease. She looks up, eyes sharp as flint, and says, “You’re not from here, child. The last stranger who wandered this road came with fire in his eyes and left with no soul.”

You swallow hard. “I—I don’t know how I got here.”

She doesn’t answer right away. She pours you a cup of water from a clay jug. It tastes faintly of earth and mint.

“You dreamt yourself here,” she whispers. “But dreams don’t end when you wake. They grow roots.”

She points to the horizon, where a single black crow circles above a forest cloaked in mist.

“That’s where the inkwell sits. The one you wrote your life from. If you want to go back… you must rewrite the ending.”

You stare at the crow. It dips, then vanishes behind the trees.

And you realize—

You were the one who fell asleep in a library in 2024, dreaming of a simpler time.

And now, in this world, all the stories ever written have begun to breathe.

And you are the only one who remembers they were ever ink on paper.

The dream… is waiting for you to finish it.

You step toward the forest.

The crow caws again—once, like a countdown.

And the trees… begin to whisper your name.
