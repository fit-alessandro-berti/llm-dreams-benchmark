As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and its whiteness begins to consume the surrounding colors. The vibrant oranges and indigos of the dream dissolve, sucked into the paper like liquid ink, until the world is drained of all intensity and left with a heavy, geometric grayness.

You reach out a trembling hand to touch the surface, expecting it to be cold and smooth, but instead, your finger sinks right into it as if you’ve brushed against thick smoke. The canvas feels wet and warm, breathing in rhythm with the fading colors around you. As you swipe your hand across the surface, the canvas doesn't get dirty; it bleeds the secrets of the world back out, and the reality of the landscape starts to scroll behind you, folding up like an old map as the blankness of the paper begins to fill with the blueprints of your own past.
