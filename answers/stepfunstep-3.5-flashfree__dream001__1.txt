You start to run, your footsteps echoing between canyon-like skyscrapers that seem to shift and shimmer at the edge of your vision. The streets are a labyrinth of identical glass and steel, and every passerby is a blur, their faces featureless. You pull out your phone, but the map app spins endlessly, showing a grid of streets that don’t match the tangled reality around you.

A street sign flickers: *"Aimwell Way"* — it looks familiar, but as you turn the corner, the street dissolves into a row of glowing, floating staircases leading nowhere. Panic rises in your throat. Time feels slippery; you check your watch, but the hands are moving backward.

Then you see it — a bodega with a hand-painted sign: *"Here for Directions."* Inside, an elderly woman with kind eyes and silver hair sorts through jars of phosphorescent liquids. “You’re lost, dear,” she says, not looking up. “The meeting is where the city remembers its name.”

“What does that mean?” you ask, breathless.

“Look up.”

You step outside and gaze at the sky. The clouds have parted, revealing not sky, but a vast, intricate clock face embedded in the dome of the city. Its hands are the size of buildings. One hand points directly to a spire in the distance — a slender, twisting tower of black iron and blue light.

“The Meeting is at the top of Chronos Spire,” the woman calls from the doorway. “But the elevator only appears when the city yawns.”

You run toward the spire, the streets now pulsing with a faint, rhythmic light, like a heartbeat. As you reach its base, a brass elevator door materializes in the wall with a soft *ding*. Inside, the walls are lined with tiny, shifting scenes — fragments of memories from the city’s past: a horse-drawn cart, a parade of floating lanterns, a silent protest. The elevator ascends, but instead of floors, the panel reads: *”9:58…” “9:59…”*.

The doors open onto a room with no walls, only vast, open air and a long table suspended over the abyss. At the head sits a figure made of shifting mist and light. “You’re late,” it says, its voice like the toll of a distant bell. “But in dreams, punctuality is a suggestion. Take a seat.”

You hesitate, then sit. The city sprawls below, no longer a maze, but a living, breathing organism of light and shadow. The meeting begins, and you realize: you’re not late. You’re exactly where you need to be.

But as you open your mouth to speak, the spire trembles, the table dissolves, and you’re falling—

—and then you wake, heart pounding, the echo of the city’s clock still ringing in your ears.
