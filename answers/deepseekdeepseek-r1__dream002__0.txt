start to run, desperate for shelter. The trees thrash wildly, their branches clawing at the sky as thunder growls like a waking beast. Rain slices sideways, sharp as needles, and the earth beneath your feet churns into rivers of mud. Ahead, through the blur of wind and water, you spot a faint amber glow—a small, weatherworn cottage nestled between ancient oaks. Its door creaks open on its own, as if summoned by your panic.  

Inside, the air is thick with the scent of dried herbs and woodsmoke. A fire crackles in the hearth, though no one seems to tend it. The walls are lined with tapestries that shift when you blink, threads rearranging into constellations, then forests, then faces. A voice, warm and resonant, hums from the shadows: *“The storm isn’t just outside, you know.”*  

You turn to see an owl perched on a clock with no hands, its eyes twin pools of molten gold. Behind it, a doorway held by ivy leads into a moonlit grove untouched by rain. The owl tilts its head. *“Tick-tock,”* it says, though the clock remains silent. *“Will you wait out the chaos, or step through?”*  

Outside, lightning splits the sky, and for a heartbeat, the storm’s roar sounds almost like laughter.
