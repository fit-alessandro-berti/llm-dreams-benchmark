In the heart of a dense forest, you find a hidden village where torches glow and laughter resonates. As you explore the lattice of wooden streets, you notice ancient texts etched on bamboo stakes—crinkled pages with forgotten wisdom. The villagers appreciate your curiosity, teaching you old techniques and modern games. You're asked to entertain the whole community with the legend of the "Skydrifters," mythical creatures that weave smoked tales. One evening, as the fires dance, you learn to weave moonlit fabric and the Star Mia activates amidst the crowd. You decide to return as adventurer, leaving friends who pledge to become their own "Moonweavers." As you drift back off with the Sound of desperately honked goats and aspirations, the villagers pretend they've found the philosopher's egg, their origin as a setting nowhere.

(Else, the ending could be: "You wake in a fraught land, where a miscalculation of heroes in Your dreams leaves you to outwit half-dried moss. You heal the soil, craft mountain vistas though the sky is hidden. Dwarf villages gawk at your prowess, and the heroes deemed failed become your newest allies. You build their White House, that under ordinary skies never flew.")

Each version suggests fulfilling a sense of adventure and accomplishment that feels like a "heartbeat of dreams."
