...completely written in a language I've never seen before. The words and symbols look like a mix of ancient hieroglyphs and mathematical equations, and I have no idea how to decipher them. I feel a surge of panic and my heart starts racing as I glance around the room, hoping to find some clue or help from my fellow students. But everyone else seems to be calmly reading through the questions, nodding to themselves as if they understand perfectly.

I look down at my own exam paper again, and the questions seem to shift and rearrrange themselves, like they're trying to confuse me even more. I see words and phrases that look like they're from different subjects altogether - "Quantum Physics", "19th Century French Literature", "Advanced Culinary Arts" - all jumbled together in a way that makes no sense.

Suddenly, I hear a voice in my head, whispering "You're not prepared for this. You'll never pass." I try to shake off the feeling of doubt, but it's hard to focus when the questions in front of me are like a puzzle I'll never solve. I take a deep breath and try to calm down, telling myself that I must have studied something that will help me, but as I scan the questions again, I realize that... I have no pencil. Or pen. Or any writing instrument at all. How am I supposed to even answer the questions?
