…written in your own handwriting, but from years you don’t remember living. The first asks you to define a term that doesn’t exist, and yet you know the answer by feel, like remembering the next stair in the dark. Your pencil moves before you decide to let it, sketching symbols that look like constellations folded into cursive. When you pause, the paper breathes—ink lifting and settling like a sleeping animal.

The second question is a map with no legend, just a coastline that keeps redrawing itself as if the tide is thinking out loud. You’re supposed to circle the city where you were born, but the cities are made of sounds. One is the hiss of a bus door. One is your mother humming through a wall. One is the crack of a baseball bat right before summer. You choose the sound of drawers shutting softly, and the map purrs, pleased.

By the third question the room begins to tilt, not physically but in purpose, as if the classroom is tired of sham and wants to confess it’s always been a theater. The proctor’s face pixelates into a mosaic of faces you’ve met once and never saw again: a cashier’s tired smile, a dentist’s magnified eyes, a child on a swing who looked at you like you were a lighthouse. You’re asked to prove, with citations, that you will be forgiven. In the margins you draw a bridge that doesn’t touch either side and label it Practice.

Halfway through, you realize the pages are thinning, the way breath thins at altitude. Between two questions you find a note addressed to you in your father’s handwriting, except he never wrote you notes. It reads: You can step outside if you need to. The word outside tugs like a sleeve. You look up and see the door is open a wedge, and through it the corridor is a shoreline, carpet turning to wet sand, fluorescent lights turning to a sky that is trying on different shades of morning.

The next question asks you to solve for x where x is the person you are when no one is watching. Your calculator won’t turn on. You try long division with your finger on the desk. The result is a remainder that hums like a refrigerator. You circle it anyway. The desk congratulates you with a gentle shiver, like a dog settling at your feet.

Time becomes a rumor. The clock hands swim in opposite directions and occasionally align like dancers pretending to be a compass. You’re reminded to fill in the bubbles completely, but the bubbles are tiny moons, and when you shade them they show you brief films—one of you on a bicycle outracing your own name, one of you at a kitchen table learning to swallow a secret, one of you reading this exact sentence and smiling because you’ve found the trapdoor.

You flip to the last page and it’s blank except for a single instruction: Demonstrate. You think of the way birds take off from a wire as if a password ran through them. You think of your friend’s hands when she talks about her grandmother. You think of the time you almost lied and didn’t. You stand up, not sure whether you’re leaving or beginning. The chair sighs, emptying your shape. The proctor tilts their head, which is now a streetlight, which is now the moon, which is now your own face reflected in the dark window of a train that isn’t moving.

You step through the wedge of door. The sand is cold and remembers your name without saying it. The sea is taking the exam too, and every answer it gives is the same answer, over and over, and still no one calls it cheating. Behind you, paper flutters like birds too small to keep. Ahead, a lighthouse blinks the slow syllables of yes. You think you’ve failed to fill something out, but your pockets are full of sharpened pencils, and they clink like keys.

Somewhere, a bell rings with the exact tone of a glass being touched lightly by a spoon. It means time, or it means dinner, or it means wake. You look at your hands and they are wet with ink that smells like rain. The ocean asks the final question without speaking. You nod. You wade. The pages dissolve into a soft, patient tide that will hold whatever you can bear to let go of, and whatever you can’t yet, and the gray horizon brightens in a way that isn’t an answer, but you recognize it, and that is enough to carry.
