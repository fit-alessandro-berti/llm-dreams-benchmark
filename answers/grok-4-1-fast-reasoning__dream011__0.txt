written in a language you've never seen before—swirling symbols that look like dancing cats mixed with quantum equations. Panic rises as the proctor, who resembles your childhood pet goldfish but with Einstein's hair, announces, "No calculators allowed, and time starts... now!"

You flip through the pages desperately. Question 1: "Explain the socioeconomic impact of invisible unicorns on 17th-century sock puppetry." Your mind races—unicorns? Socks? You scribble nonsense about glitter shortages, but the paper starts melting like wax under a flame.

Suddenly, the exam room morphs into a giant carnival Ferris wheel. Desks spin wildly, classmates turn into cotton candy clouds shouting answers in pig Latin. You grab a pencil that sprouts wings and flies off, leaving you to write with your elbow dipped in mustard.

The goldfish-proctor booms, "Cheating detected!" as your answers rearrange themselves into haikus about lost socks. Your heart pounds—you're failing your future! Just as a tidal wave of exam papers crashes toward you, everything blurs...

You jolt awake, tangled in sheets, heart racing. The clock shows you're late for *real* work. Thank god it was just a dream. Or was it? Your alarm blares a haiku: "Unicorns dance free / Socks hide in quantum shadows / Study harder now."
