You start to panic, a cold sweat prickling your skin despite the strangely warm, almost tropical air hanging heavy around you.  The buildings tower, impossibly tall, made of a shimmering, obsidian-like material that reflects the sky in distorted, rippling images.  Streetlights hum with a low, resonant thrum, casting an eerie, violet glow on the strangely silent crowds that drift past like phantoms. No one seems to notice you, or perhaps they do and simply choose to ignore you.  Your reflection in a nearby puddle shows a face you don’t recognize – older, wearier, with eyes that hold a sadness you've never felt before.

You pull out a crumpled invitation from your pocket, the paper brittle and dissolving at the edges. It simply reads: "The Clocktower, Midnight."  No address, no further details.  The only clue is a tiny, almost invisible, symbol stamped in one corner – a coiled serpent swallowing its own tail.  

Desperation spurs you into action. You begin questioning the few passersby who seem vaguely aware of your presence. They mumble cryptic phrases about “the labyrinth” and “the keeper of time,” their words melting into the constant hum of the city.  One particularly gaunt figure points towards a sprawling network of alleyways, choked with overgrown vegetation and dripping with an unnatural, phosphorescent moss.  

Hesitantly, you follow, the air growing colder and damper with every step. The alleyways twist and turn, seemingly endless, leading you deeper into a maze of shadowed corners and forgotten places.  Then, amidst the chaos, you spot it: a towering clocktower, impossibly tall, its clock face displaying only a single, ominous hand pointing directly at midnight.  But as you approach, the clocktower begins to shift and melt, the obsidian material flowing like liquid night, swallowing the surrounding buildings.  You’re no longer sure if you're chasing the meeting, or if the meeting is chasing you.  And then, you wake up.
