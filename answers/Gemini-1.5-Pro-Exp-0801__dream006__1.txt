...begin to feel the blood drain from my face. The microphone feels cold and slick in my hand, like a wriggling fish. My carefully rehearsed opening lines vanish from my mind, replaced by a swirling vortex of static. The expectant faces blur into a sea of anonymous, judging eyes. My throat tightens, a desert wind whistling through a cracked canyon.
Suddenly, the stage starts to tilt, a slow, agonizing descent into the audience. I stumble, desperately trying to regain my balance, grabbing at the podium which transforms into a melting ice sculpture beneath my grasp. The murmuring of the crowd rises to a deafening roar, a cacophony of whispers, giggles, and outright guffaws.
As I slide closer to the edge, I notice something strange. The faces in the audience are no longer human. They've morphed into grotesque caricatures: elongated noses, bulbous eyes, and mouths stretched into wide, unnerving grins. Their laughter takes on an animalistic quality, a chorus of barking hyenas and screeching monkeys.
Terror grips me, a cold fist squeezing the air from my lungs. I try to scream, but only a choked gasp escapes my lips. Just as I'm about to plunge into the swirling abyss of the audience, I realize I'm not falling. I'm floating.
Slowly, silently, I ascend above the stage, the mocking laughter fading into a distant hum. The grotesque faces shrink below, becoming a sea of indistinguishable dots. I look down at my hands, no longer clutching the treacherous microphone, but instead spread wide, as if embracing the cool night air.
Looking up, I see the ceiling of the auditorium dissolve, revealing a vast expanse of starry sky. A sense of calm washes over me, replacing the fear with a strange, exhilarating freedom. I am no longer bound by the expectations of the crowd, the weight of the speech, the fear of failure. I am adrift, weightless, and strangely content in the silence of the dream.
And then, I wake up.
