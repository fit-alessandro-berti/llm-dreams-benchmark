You're in the middle of the argument, the rain drumming like a heartbeat outside the window, both of you staring at me in disbelief. I don't know what it is—what's left of the words. 

“*You don’t realize this, do you?*” I say, my voice a fraction lower than before. The other person’s voice is louder now, like a storm is about to tear open the window. “This is not about *us* anymore. It’s about *you*.” 

The argument shifts, the blame turning like ash on the fire. I can feel the heat radiating through the room, but my body refuses to go hot. I pull my hand away from the weapon in my palm, the anger flickering like static in the air. The other person stares down at me, eyes red like shattered glass. 

“I never wanted this,” they say. “I just wanted to make sure we didn’t lose ourselves.” 

I nod, my voice a gentle breath in the room. We break the silence, the words cooling down to a shared silence that fills the space like a blanket. The argument is over, and I don’t know what it feels like to still be held.
