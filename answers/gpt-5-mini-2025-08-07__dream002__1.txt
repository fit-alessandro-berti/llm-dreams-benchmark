You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air tightens, like breath held behind a closed door. The sunlight that had been stitching golden threads through the leaves dims, and each tree leans a little closer as if to gossip. Far off, thunder rolls—not the angry grumble of real weather, but a drumbeat that seems to name something you almost remember.

A wind moves in that has a voice. It slips through the branches and speaks in syllables made of rain. It tugs at your clothes, at the hem of your thoughts, and with every gust it brings small things upward: fallen leaves that spin like coins, puddles that boil into mist, a handful of feathers that float as if rewinding motion. The forest floor, which had been solid beneath your boots, becomes less certain, like stepping across a threshold into another memory.

The first drops are not water but tiny glass beads that patter against your skin with a tinkling sound. When one shatters on your palm it dissolves into perfume—cedar and musk and something sweet you thought belonged to childhood. You laugh because it isn’t frightening; there is a curious, tender quality to the storm, as if it were unmaking and remaking the world to show you something hidden.

Lightning unspools itself not across the sky but from the trunks of ancient oaks. Rivulets of light crawl up the bark and open pictures in the wood—faces you know and faces you do not, scenes of far-off places, doors opening onto other forests. Each flash reveals a path you could take: one paved with glass, one that leads down into velvet darkness, one that climbs into a ladder of stars. A fox appears, soaked in phosphorescence, and regards you with solemn, human eyes. It steps ahead and then turns as if to say, Follow if you want to.

You do.

The storm thickens into pages — not rain but sheets of paper falling in a slow, deliberate downpour. When one settles in your lap it reads a line of your life that hasn't yet been lived. The sentences are incomplete, mottled with ink that smears if you try to grip it. You stand in a clearing where the wind arranges these pages into a doorway. Shapes move behind the paper chandelier: the echo of a laugh, the weight of an old regret, a promise you almost kept. You are given a choice that feels both impossible and inevitable. To step through is to let the storm rewrite what you thought you were.

You step.

The world tilts and becomes both enormous and intimate. Rain becomes radio static that turns into a lullaby your mother hummed, thunder folds into applause, and lightning pins a constellation on the map of your skin. For a moment you are many people at once—child, exile, lover, stranger—each holding a single thread of the story. You pull on one and the forest rearranges; you tug another and a memory floats up like a lantern.

When the storm finally begins to subside, the forest is changed in small, precise ways. A sapling grows where there had been only leaf litter. A path you didn't notice before now arcs away into a sun-sifted hollow. In your hand, a bead of glass has become a small, warm stone engraved with a word you instantly understand but cannot yet say aloud.

You look up. The sky is clearing, and the light beyond the clouds is not just day but a possibility. The fox pads off into the underbrush and once again becomes just an animal. You breathe. The world feels both new and somehow older than before, as if the storm had taken out all the small things that kept you apart from yourself and put them back with a gentler touch.

You walk on, the path soft beneath your feet, carrying the stone like a secret. Behind you the forest hums—not with weather now, but with stories waiting, like seeds in the soil. Ahead, the hollow calls. You move toward it, knowing storms will come and go, but certain that each one brings something you are ready to meet.
