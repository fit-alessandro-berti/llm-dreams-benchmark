…a single paintbrush suspended mid-air, glowing faintly like a whispered promise.

The moment you reach for it, every color you’ve ever seen—or thought you could never see—condenses into the bristles. Ultramarines bloom next to sounds too sharp to name; rusted oranges slide into the hush between two heartbeats. When the brush touches the blank canvas, the fabric of everything ripples outward in perfect circles.

Stroke by stroke your own silhouette appears, but the outline keeps slipping: now half-giraffe necked, now diving whale-tailed, now made entirely of lattice windows opening on aquarium skies. Each new contour splits off and walks away—walking upstream along a river of your own breaths, which are visible now as silver threads that unravel into staircase spirals.

One of those staircases leans against nothing and you climb it, forgetting foot-shaped reasoning. Mid-leap, the canvas’s center peels itself like a tangerine, revealing a negative space shaped exactly like tomorrow’s laughter. You dip the brush into that hole—not in ink but in the idea of “between.” What flickers out isn’t paint but a swarm of origami fireflies forging constellations that spell the smell of warm bread.

They clump into a doorway. Through it you glimpse an orchard where every tree bears fruit made of mirrors; each mirror reflects a version of your past until you remember the moment, eight years old, when you realized the sky was a bowl turned upside-down and you laughed so hard you couldn’t finish coloring the sun. That unfinished yellow leaks now from the orchard floor and puddles beneath your adult feet, until both ages wear the same shoes.

The paintbrush in your hand softens into a strip of cinema film; the frames show that same orchard blinking between four seasons per eye-blink. Realizing this film is the only continuous thread in the whole dream—color, shape, and time hurrying to borrow its edges—you tear a single frame free. It rustles like dry paper, then folds itself into a paper boat. You set the boat on the puddle of childhood yellow.

At once the puddle becomes an ocean with horizons made of accordion folds. You step in; the water is the exact temperature of a kitchen at dawn in winter. The paper boat surges forward, driven by the small white teeth of moonlight biting a path through the crests. On the opposite shore, someone waves—a figure whose face is the back of your own head, a mirror without glass. The closer the boat glides, the more its outline becomes the frame you tore away from destiny, now lit from within by the orchard it once captured.

When you step onto the sand, the world turns briefly monochrome: all colors collapsing to the thin line of a horizon. Then, as if remembering itself, the monochrome cracks open like an egg, and color pours back in—this time breathing, with eyelids, watching. The figure with the back-of-your-head face reaches out; its hand is the brush again, bristles now coarser with all the places it touched. It presses the handle into your palm.

Together you raise the brush to the sky. One stroke, and the sky unfolds into an origami map creased with the exact shape of every thought you will ever have after waking. Another stroke, and the map folds back into the size of your iris. The final stroke leaves a tiny hole floating in the air—just large enough for a key made of silence to slip through.

You close your fist around the key. When you open it, the canvas is lying at your feet in the grass of ordinary morning. No paintbrush. No orchard. But in one corner of the canvas there is now a single imperfect circle of warm bread smell, pulsing gently like a resting heartbeat.
