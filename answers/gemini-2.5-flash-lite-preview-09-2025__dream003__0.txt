You are dreaming. Can you complete the following dream?

You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and **a faint, rhythmic pulsing emanating from within, like a slow, sleeping heart.**

The wood of the box isn't wood at all, you realize as your fingers trace the grain. It's something smoother, cooler, shifting slightly under your touch—like petrified moonlight or obsidian polished by deep-sea currents. The patterns aren't carved; they seem *alive*, moving slowly, reforming into symbols you almost recognize from forgotten nursery rhymes or astronomical charts seen only in the corner of your eye.

As you lean closer, trying to decipher the script, the air around the box thickens, smelling faintly of ozone and distant lavender. You realize the "lock" isn't a physical mechanism; there is no keyhole, no latch. Instead, at the center of the shifting pattern, there is a smooth, circular indentation—perfectly sized, perfectly smooth.

Suddenly, you know what it needs, without being told. It needs a memory.

You press your palm against the indentation, and the box drinks the warmth from your skin. The intricate patterns flare with soft, internal light—not electric, but organic, like bioluminescence. You feel a profound sense of *loss* well up in your chest, the exact memory required being something precious you can no longer fully recall: perhaps the sound of your grandmother’s true laugh, or the exact color of the sky on the day you learned to ride a bicycle without training wheels.

The box demands more. The light brightens, becoming insistent. You press your forehead against the cool surface, pouring in fragments of sensation—the taste of rain on a hot sidewalk, the feeling of genuine, uncomplicated belief.

When you finally pull back, breathless, the box doesn't fly open. Instead, the shifting patterns coalesce into a single, perfect image etched onto the surface: **a miniature, shimmering reflection of your own eye, wide open.**

And as you stare into the reflected eye on the box, you realize *you* are the key.

The box dissolves not with a click, but with a gentle inhalation of light. Where it stood is now only a small, polished river stone, warm in your hand. When you look down at the stone, you see that the intricate patterns haven't disappeared; they have simply migrated. They are now woven beneath your own skin, pulsing faintly under the surface of your palm, waiting for the next lock you have yet to find.

And then, the dream fades, leaving you with the lingering scent of lavender and the unsettling certainty that you are carrying something vital away with you.
