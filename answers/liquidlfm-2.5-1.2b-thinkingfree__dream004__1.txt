As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and it shimmered, reflecting every fragment of your mind and all memories ever held—in its glossy void, mountains cradled in indigo, rivers of stardust cutting through darkness, and a figure emerging from within the static grain. The paint itself seemed to breathe, a pulse beneath your fingertips, and for a moment, the world dissolved into vivid fragments: forests of brick, oceans of smoke, a lone clock wrapped in vines. You realized the canvas wasn’t empty—it was a mirror, and you were just beginning to draw it onto the world when your reflection smiles back, now fused with its rebirth. The scene whirled, then faded, leaving only the echo of colors humming in your bones, waiting to be remembered.
