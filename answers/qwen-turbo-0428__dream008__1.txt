You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel a cold sweat creep up your spine. The clock on the wall ticks louder than ever, as if it's mocking you. You glance at the stack of emails, the unfinished tasks, the looming meetings—everything seems to be screaming at you at once.

But then, something strange happens. The lights flicker, and the walls begin to pulse like a heartbeat. Your computer screen blinks, and instead of the usual clutter, it shows a single line: **"Start with the end in mind."**

You blink, and suddenly, you're not in your office anymore. You're standing in a vast, endless library, shelves stretching into infinity. Each book is labeled with a different version of your life—some with success, some with failure, some with nothing at all. You walk forward, drawn by an unseen force, until you find a book titled **"The Project That Changed Everything."**

As you open it, the words begin to rewrite themselves, not on paper, but in your mind. You see yourself working late, solving problems that seemed unsolvable, leading your team with calm and clarity. You see the final presentation, the applause, the relief. But more than that, you see the growth, the unexpected insights, the connections made along the way.

Then, just as quickly as it began, the dream shifts again. You’re back in your office, but the atmosphere has changed. The pressure still lingers, but now it feels different—less like a burden, more like a challenge. You take a deep breath, open your laptop, and begin.

And this time, you don’t just meet the deadline. You exceed it.
