…you hear the first distant rumble of thunder rolling across the canopy above. The soft green light of the forest begins to shift; leaves tremble as gusts of wind whisper through the branches. A warm breeze morphs into a sharp chill on your skin.

Suddenly, a flash of lightning splits the sky—brilliant white against the darkening leaves—and you feel an urgent pull, as if the storm itself is calling you forward. Moss‑covered roots twist under your boots, guiding you deeper between ancient trunks. Every sense sharpens: the sweet, earthy scent of wet pine; the metallic taste of the charged air; the gentle patter of fat raindrops beginning to fall.

You press on until you emerge into a circular clearing at the forest’s heart. Here, the storm’s power seems to intensify. Rain lashes in sheets; wind circles like an invisible dancer, stirring dust and fragrant petals in a swirling halo around you. Ahead, a great stone altar stands, its surface carved with runes that glow faintly with electric blue light. Despite the tempest, the altar feels like a beacon—an answer to some deep‑seated question you’ve carried with you.

Thunder cracks overhead, and a bolt of lightning strikes the altar’s center. The runes flare brilliantly, illuminating the entire clearing. In that flash, you see shadows coalesce around the altar’s base—wisps of mist forming silhouettes of figures, half‑human, half‑tree. They lift their arms in silent greeting, their eyes alight with ancient knowledge.

A calm voice—neither male nor female—echoes through the storm: “Welcome, Seeker. The forest has awaited your arrival. Step forward, and claim the wisdom you were born to bear.”

Heart thundering in your chest, you take a step toward the glowing runes. Raindrops sizzle as they hit the stone altar, yet around you the wind seems to part, creating a bubble of stillness. You reach out, fingertips brushing the cool, glowing carvings. In that moment, time stretches: memories you never knew you had unfurl in your mind—visions of past storms survived, forests healed, destinies fulfilled.

The thunder fades into a low, resonant hum. The rain slows to a gentle patter. In the hush that follows, the mysterious figures bow, and the voice speaks again: “Now you carry the storm’s strength and the forest’s grace. Go forth, and let your dream shape the world.”

As you lift your hand from the altar, the runes dim, and the clearing brightens. A single shaft of sunlight pierces the cloud cover above, lighting your path back through the silent trees. You turn, drawn forward by a newfound purpose—you awake, heart brimming with wonder, knowing the forest’s secret still throbs within you.
