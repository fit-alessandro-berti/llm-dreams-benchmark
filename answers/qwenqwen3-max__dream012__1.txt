You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you grip the wheel with salt-stung hands, the wood slick beneath your fingers. Thunder cracks like the sky splitting open, and waves taller than the mainmast heave the vessel skyward before plunging it into churning valleys of black water.

Your boots slip on the rain-slick deck, but you don’t flinch. You’ve sailed these waters in waking life and in dreams—though this storm feels older than memory, as if the ocean itself remembers you.

“Batten the mainsail!” you shout over the gale, your voice raw but steady. “Secure the cargo—everything below deck!” The crew scrambles, their faces pale but resolute. You recognize them now—not just your usual hands, but faces from your childhood, your lost friends, even your younger self, all dressed in oilskins and hope.

Lightning flashes again, and in that stark white instant, you see it: not a ship ahead, but a lighthouse—impossible, for you’re far from any coast. Its beam cuts through the tempest like a promise. You point, and the crew follows your gesture, their eyes widening.

“Steady as she goes!” you cry, steering toward the light. The storm seems to recoil, as if offended by your defiance. The wind howls like a wounded beast, but the sea begins to calm, the waves softening into swells.

Then, a voice—not from the crew, not from the wind, but from deep within the hull, resonant and ancient: *“You were never lost. Only remembering how to return.”*

The ship glides into still water. Stars pierce the retreating clouds. And as the first hint of dawn stains the eastern sky, you realize the lighthouse isn’t made of stone—it’s woven from the memories you’d buried: your mother’s laughter, the smell of old books, the quiet courage of ordinary days.

You turn to your crew, now smiling, their faces glowing with peace. “We’re home,” you say. And the dream, like the storm, dissolves—not into nothing, but into the quiet certainty that you’ve always known the way.
