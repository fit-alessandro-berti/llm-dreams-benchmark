You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language you’ve never seen before—symbols that shift and flicker like static on a screen. When you try to focus, the words dissolve into a cascade of numbers, then morph into abstract shapes that seem to *breathe*. Panic sets in, but you force yourself to concentrate. The first question asks, *“What is the color of your deepest fear?”* You stare at it, unsure if it’s a trick. Before you can answer, the room begins to tilt, and the exam paper starts to float, pages flipping wildly. A voice echoes in your mind, not from the teacher but from within your own head: *“You’ve already failed. The answers are in your past.”*  

The questions grow stranger. One asks, *“How many times have you lied to yourself about your potential?”* Another: *“What would you sacrifice to avoid this moment?”* Each response you give seems to alter the exam’s structure, adding more questions that feel personal, almost invasive. You realize the exam isn’t testing knowledge—it’s testing *you*. The stakes aren’t just your career; they’re your identity, your choices, your very existence.  

Then, the screen behind you flickers, and a figure appears—a version of yourself, younger, holding a different career path. It smiles. *“You’re not here to take the exam,”* it says. *“You’re here to *become* the question.”*  

The dream lingers, unresolved, as the questions multiply, and the line between reality and the exam blurs. What will you answer? What will you become?
