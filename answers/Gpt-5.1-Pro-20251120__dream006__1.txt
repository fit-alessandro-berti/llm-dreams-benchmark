…speak, but at first no sound comes out.

Your lips move, your throat tightens, but the microphone stays silent. The crowd keeps waiting, still and patient, like a photograph that hasn’t decided to become real yet.

A hot wave of panic rises in your chest.

You glance down at the podium, hoping to see your notes, but what’s there instead is… a toothbrush, a half-eaten apple, and a small, ticking alarm clock. The clock hands are spinning wildly, going through hours in seconds.

You blink.

The front row shifts. People you know are sitting there now—faces from different parts of your life, all next to each other: a childhood friend, a teacher you’d forgotten, someone you only met once on a train, an ex, a stranger whose face you somehow still recognize. They all look at you like they already know what you’re supposed to say.

A voice behind you whispers, “Go on, they’re waiting.”

You turn, but there’s no one there. Just the tall red curtain, stretching up and up and up into darkness.

Your heart is pounding. You try again to speak.

This time, sound comes out—but it’s the wrong sound. You hear yourself saying the alphabet, like a child:

“A… B… C…”

The microphone echoes it back, huge and booming. You want to stop, but your mouth keeps going, filling the room with simple, clumsy letters. A soft laugh ripples through the audience—not mean, just surprised.

You freeze on “G.”

Something inside you clicks.

You suddenly remember: *You are dreaming.*

The thought drops into your mind like a stone into a lake. The moment it lands, the stage lights brighten and shift. Colors become too sharp, too clean. The audience blurs at the edges, as if they’re painted on mist.

“I’m dreaming,” you say, this time on purpose.

Your voice is clear now. It spreads easily through the auditorium. The microphone doesn’t squeal or fail; it just carries your words.

The crowd leans in.

You look down at the strange objects again. The toothbrush has become a pen. The bitten apple has turned into a small globe. The spinning clock has slowed. Its hands now move at a normal pace, ticking softly.

You pick up the pen first.

It feels heavier than it looks, like it’s full of all the things you could say but haven’t yet. When you lift it, glowing words appear in the air beside you, hanging there like floating captions. At first they’re random:

“late bus”
“missed chances”
“unanswered messages”
“things you didn’t say”

The audience watches the words appear and disappear. No one seems alarmed. They’re just curious, attentive.

You switch to the globe. It’s warm in your hands, and parts of it light up as you touch them—cities, oceans, small places you’ve never been but somehow recognize. As your fingers trace the glowing spots, the floating words change:

“begin again”
“go anyway”
“you’re allowed”
“still in time”

You realize that whatever you focus on is shaping the speech.

The nervousness is still there, but now it feels different—less like a trap and more like a doorway.

You clear your throat. “I was afraid to come up here,” you say, speaking honestly. Your voice echoes gently, but it doesn’t overwhelm you. “I thought I didn’t know what to say.”

Somewhere in the back row, a light flickers on, illuminating a single person nodding slowly. Then another light. And another. Tiny spotlights shine randomly across the audience, revealing faces that are quietly agreeing with you.

“I keep thinking I’m not ready,” you say. “That I’m late. That I should’ve figured everything out by now.”

The clock on the podium is completely still. The hands have stopped at no particular time. The ticking is gone. Instead, you hear the soft rustle of people breathing, shifting, listening.

You look up and decide to ask the crowd a question.

“Has anyone else felt like that?”

Every hand goes up.

Not just in the front row, but all the way to the back, up into the balcony, even in the shadows. Hundreds, maybe thousands of hands, raising gently into the air. The sight hits you in the chest with a kind, heavy warmth.

The stage beneath your feet changes texture. You glance down and see that it’s no longer polished wood. Now it looks like a long path, stretching behind you into your own memories, and forward into darkness you haven’t walked yet.

You step away from the podium.

As you walk, the microphone follows you on its stand, gliding smoothly across the stage without any cables. It stays at the perfect distance from your mouth, like it wants you to keep going.

You say, “I don’t know exactly what I’m doing. I don’t have a perfect plan. I mess up. I freeze. I overthink. I lose my words.”

The floating words around you change again:

“trying counts”
“not over”
“you’re learning”

Your voice softens. “But I’m here anyway.”

Your admission doesn’t feel like a confession. It feels like an opening.

The curtain behind you ripples. It rises on its own, and instead of backstage ropes and sandbags, you see fragments of your life: rooms you’ve lived in, places you’ve left, choices you made, choices you didn’t. They’re not in order. They appear and vanish like scenes in a film you’re watching and starring in at the same time.

In one scene, you see yourself walking away from something you wanted. In another, you’re laughing with someone you miss. In another, you’re sitting alone, scrolling endlessly, waiting for a feeling that doesn’t arrive.

You keep talking.

“Maybe the point isn’t to have a flawless speech,” you say, watching your past self move through those scenes. “Maybe the point is to stand here—exactly as I am—and speak anyway. With the voice I have, not the voice I wish I had.”

The you in those scenes turns, one by one, and looks toward the stage—as if they can hear you now. Each version of you raises a hand in a small, quiet wave.

You feel something release in your chest.

You look back out at the audience. Their faces are clearer now, less blended, more human. Some are smiling, some are teary-eyed, some just watching calmly. But no one looks bored. No one looks hostile. They seem… relieved.

You realize they’re not here to judge you. They’re here because they needed to hear someone say this out loud.

You take a breath.

“Here’s what I want to tell you,” you say, and the microphone hums gently, highlighting the moment. “You’re not late. You’re not behind. You’re not supposed to have it all figured out by now. You’re just… here. And that’s enough to start.”

As you speak, the stage path in front of you lights up a little at a time, like stepping stones appearing just before your feet land on them. You never see the whole way, only the next step or two, but it’s enough.

The applause starts quietly.

Not the usual sharp clapping, but a soft, rolling sound—like rain beginning. You hadn’t finished your speech yet, but maybe that *was* the speech.

You smile, and it feels natural, unforced.

You bow your head slightly, not out of habit, but in thanks—to the audience, to your past selves behind the curtain, to the version of you who walked onto the stage even when afraid.

The lights begin to dim.

The audience fades, row by row, like someone is gently erasing them from the edges inward. The microphone dissolves into dust and rises, turning into faint stars that drift up into the dark ceiling.

You’re left standing alone on the path of the stage, surrounded by calm.

A soft voice—your own, but older, or maybe younger—whispers from somewhere close:

“Remember this when you wake up.”

You nod, even though you can’t see where the voice is coming from. You close your eyes.

The last thing you feel is the sensation of taking one more step forward into the unknown—

—and then you’re in your bed, heart steady, the echo of applause still faintly in your ears, the memory of the dream sitting in your chest like a small, warm light that didn’t exist there before.
