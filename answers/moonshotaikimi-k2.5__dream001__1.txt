run, but your feet sink into the pavement like it's wet cement, then suddenly you're wearing someone else's shoes—heavy leather boots that clomp with the weight of church bells. You pull out your phone to check the address, but the screen keeps rippling like water, and when you finally manage to read it, the letters rearrange themselves into hieroglyphs that you somehow understand mean *The Building With Blue Windows* even though no such building exists, or does it?

You turn a corner and the street folds upward like a page being turned, depositing you in a market square where vendors sell clocks that tick backwards. An old woman with your grandmother's hands (but your boss's face) grabs your wrist and says, "You're going the wrong way, the meeting was yesterday," and you feel a jolt of relief until you realize that means you've already missed it, or perhaps you're about to miss it, time looping around you like a Möbius strip made of subway maps.

You start flying—or rather, the sidewalk starts moving like an airport conveyor belt, whisking you past buildings that lean together to whisper secrets about you. You see a doorway glowing with the particular shade of fluorescent light that means *office*, and you burst through it, panting, only to find yourself in a forest where trees have conference room tables growing out of their trunks, and birds wearing neckties are pecking at agendas made of birch bark.

Your watch says you have three minutes left, then seventeen hours, then it's just a spiral spinning endlessly. You climb a staircase that goes down, down, down into the clouds, and there—floating in the mist—is the room. The door is made of glass but feels like velvet when you push it.

Inside, everyone is already there, but they have no faces, just smooth ovals turning toward you with expressions you can feel rather than see. They nod as if you've been speaking for hours. One of them (you know instinctively it's the one you needed to impress) slides a cup of coffee toward you that smells like your childhood bedroom, and says, "You're exactly on time. We've been waiting for you to remember that the meeting was never about what you thought."

You sit down, and your briefcase dissolves into sand, and the relief is so profound that the walls begin to melt, and you realize you're already waking up, the city dissolving like sugar in rain, but somewhere in the fading echo, you hear someone laughing—not at you, but with you—and you carry that sound up through the layers of sleep like a golden thread, knowing that when you open your eyes, you'll still know exactly where you need to go.
