...feel a wave of anxiety crash over you. The office seems to warp and stretch, the walls breathing subtly, as though alive. Your boss's face is stern but strangely distorted—it shifts between familiar and unrecognizable features. You glance down at your desk, and the project folder is enormous, teetering like a skyscraper, filled with papers that flutter endlessly despite the lack of wind.

Before you can open it, a strange noise draws your attention. The hum of fluorescent lights above morphs into whispers—indistinct murmurs that seem to be coming from the air itself. You turn around, and your coworkers have melted into shadowy figures, typing furiously on keyboards that emit sparks instead of letters. The sense of unease heightens.

Determined to face the task, you take a breath and open the folder. Inside, instead of papers, you find a glowing orb pulsing with light. The whispers grow louder. When you touch the orb, the office disintegrates into a kaleidoscope of colors, and you're suddenly standing in a forest filled with bioluminescent trees. The orb floats out of your hands and hovers in front of you, projecting a map onto the star-speckled sky. The deadline, you realize, now refers to a journey you must take—somewhere deep into this dreamlike wilderness.

Your boss’s voice echoes in the distance, saying, "You’ve already started the project. Remember, it’s all about the *choices you make.*" The forest comes alive with strange creatures—some friendly, others ominous—and paths stretch infinitely in all directions. The orb starts to dim and flicker, and you know you must decide quickly which way to go.

What do you do?
