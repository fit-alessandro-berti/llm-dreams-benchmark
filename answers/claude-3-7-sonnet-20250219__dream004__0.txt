# The Dream Continues...

You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and...

...feel an inexplicable pull toward it. As your fingers hover near its surface, the canvas begins to ripple like water. When you finally touch it, your hand passes through, pulling you into a dimension where thoughts materialize instantly.

The air here tastes like memories—some sweet, others bittersweet. Floating islands of half-formed ideas drift by, each one glowing with potential. You reach out and pluck a thought-bubble containing a melody you've never heard but somehow recognize.

When you hum it, the space around you responds, transforming into a forest of crystalline trees that chime harmoniously with each note. Their branches extend toward you, offering fruits shaped like geometric puzzles that rearrange themselves when you look at them from different angles.
