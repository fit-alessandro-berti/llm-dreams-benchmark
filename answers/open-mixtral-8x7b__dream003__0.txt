runes etched into the surface. A soft glow emanates from these markings, and you feel a strange compulsion to solve the puzzle they present. 

Suddenly, the box begins to vibrate gently in your hands. It grows warmer, and the runes' glow intensifies. A whispering voice seems to speak directly into your mind, guiding you through the process of unlocking the box.

Each rune corresponds to a specific element or concept - earth, air, fire, water, spirit, and so on. As you touch each rune in turn, visualizing its corresponding element, the box's vibrations increase.

Finally, when all the runes have been activated, a loud click echoes from the box. The lid pops open slightly, revealing a cloud of swirling mist inside. As you reach for it, the mist coalesces into a small, glowing orb.

The voice returns, explaining that this orb contains a single wish - one that will be granted when you release the orb from its prison. You hesitate, considering the potential consequences of such power. But ultimately, curiosity gets the better of you, and you set the orb free.

With a burst of light and a deafening roar, the orb disappears, leaving behind a profound sense of peace and fulfillment. You wake up, feeling refreshed and eager to face the day, with the memory of your dream still vivid in your mind.
