...feel a prickling heat on my palms. Not fear, exactly, but a vibrating anticipation that thrummed through my limbs. The stage lights, a kaleidoscope of colour, seemed to pulse in sync with my nervous energy. Their expectant gazes, a sea of blurred silhouettes, pressed in, yet I felt strangely suspended above it all. This wasn't a stage, not really. It was a vast, open meadow, filled with whispering grass that swayed gently in a breeze that smelled of wildflowers and burnt cinnamon.

Suddenly, my throat felt tight. I opened my mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead, a melody filled the air, a cascading waterfall of notes that seemed to flow from somewhere deep within me. It rose in a plaintive cry, then softened into a mournful lullaby, the lyrics appearing in my mind as if written in the stars above:

*"Is anyone out there,?*" it questioned, *”Can you hear my song?”*

The crowd responded with a hushed murmur, their silence more profound than any applause. The melody swelled, weaving its way through the nodding grass, each note carrying a story, a pain, a longing. It spoke of forgotten dreams, of stifled voices, of souls searching for connection. 

As the final note faded, a young girl, her eyes shining with understanding, stepped forward. She held out a small, intricately carved wooden flute, mirroring the melody I'd sung. "I hear you," she whispered, her voice a soft echo of the wind. "We all hear you."

A ripple of movement spread through the crowd. Others followed, each offering an instrument, a voice, a hand – a tapestry of sound and light began to emerge, weaving a symphony of shared experience, of collective hope.  And in that moment, I knew. This wasn’t a speech. This was a conversation. We were listening, we were sharing, and we were finding each other, human to human, in the language of the soul.
