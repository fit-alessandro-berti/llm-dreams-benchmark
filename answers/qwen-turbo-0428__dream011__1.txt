You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language you don’t recognize—except they feel familiar, like memories from a dream you had long ago. The clock starts ticking, and you realize you can’t read the words, but your hands move on their own, writing answers that make perfect sense. 

As you finish the last question, the room begins to shift. The walls dissolve into a vast, starry sky, and you’re standing on a bridge made of light, stretching into infinity. Below you, the world you know is reflected in a mirror-like lake, but the reflections are not your own—they’re versions of you, each walking different paths, making different choices.

A voice echoes: *"The exam was never about knowledge. It was about trust."* You look up and see your younger self smiling, holding a key that glows with your name. The bridge trembles, and you realize the exam was never meant to be solved—it was meant to be *experienced*. 

And then you wake up, heart racing, with the feeling that you’ve just glimpsed the path ahead.
