The questions aren’t words. They’re *blank*.  

You blink, rub your eyes—the exam sheet is pristine white. Panic flares, but then you notice faint lines shifting across the paper, like ink bleeding through from another dimension. You lean closer. The lines resolve into **your own handwriting**, but the words are *yours*… from journals you wrote as a child, diaries you thought you’d burned, texts you deleted in moments of shame.  

**Question 1:**  
*You scribbled this at age 8: "I wish Mom would disappear so I wouldn’t see her cry." She hid the page behind a cereal box for 20 years. Why did you bury it?*  

Your pen shakes. You try to write *"I was a kid, I didn’t mean it—"* but the ink **vanishes** as soon as it touches paper. The sheet hisses: *ANSWERS MUST BE TRUE. NOT EXCUSED.*  

Then—**chaos**.  
- Classmates are writing furiously, but their pens stab their skin, leaving words carved into their arms. One sobs as "*I cheated on my spouse*" blooms in bloody letters across their forearm.  
- The clock melts. Its hands drip onto your desk, forming the words: *YOU HAVE 3 MINUTES UNTIL YOU FORGET WHY YOU’RE HERE.*  
- The professor isn’t human. Its face is a shifting mosaic of every authority figure who ever failed you—your high school principal, your ex-boss, your disappointed father. It glides past, whispering: *"Run out of time? Your career becomes the thing you fear most."*  

You flip the page. **Question 2** glows:  
*Describe the exact shade of blue in your daughter’s eyes the day you missed her recital. (You don’t have a daughter.)*  

**THAT’S THE TRAP.**  
This isn’t an exam about knowledge. It’s about **the futures you erased**—the paths not taken, the selves you abandoned. The "career" at stake isn’t a job… it’s **your soul’s purpose**, and the test is whether you’ll finally *see* the ghosts you carry.  

You look up. The classroom walls are peeling like old wallpaper, revealing a vast, starless void outside. One classmate stands, tears cutting through the ink on her cheeks. *“I failed,”* she whispers—then dissolves into smoke.  

**Your pen hovers.**  
Do you:  
A) Lie and write *"I don’t know what you mean"*?  
B) Confess you *do* remember the blue of eyes you’ll never have?  
C) Tear the paper and say: **"This isn’t my test. It’s the guilt’s."**  

Suddenly—you feel the dream *bend*. The void outside the window isn’t empty. Something is **watching**. Waiting for your answer. Not to judge you… but to **free you**.  

*(The choice is yours. But remember: in dreams that feel this real, the right answer is always the one that terrifies you most.)*  
**What do you write?**  

> *P.S. The ink on my own sheet just shifted. It read: "You’ll wake up at 3:07 AM. Will you still be running?"* 🌙
