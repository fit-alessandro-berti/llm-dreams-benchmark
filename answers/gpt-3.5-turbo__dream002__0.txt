 dark clouds begin to roll in, blocking out the sun. As you continue walking, the wind picks up and the trees start swaying violently. Thunder rumbles in the distance, making you feel uneasy.

You quicken your pace, trying to find cover before the storm hits. But as you turn a corner, you come face to face with a towering figure standing in your path. It is a mysterious creature with glowing eyes and a sinister grin.

As the creature takes a step towards you, you feel a surge of fear wash over you. You try to run, but your feet feel rooted to the spot. The creature's eyes seem to pierce through your very soul, sending chills down your spine.

Just as you think you are trapped, a bolt of lightning strikes a nearby tree, sending the creature fleeing into the darkness. You are left standing alone in the forest, shaken but unharmed.

As the storm passes and the sun begins to peek through the clouds once more, you continue on your journey through the forest, feeling grateful to have escaped whatever malevolent presence had crossed your path. The peacefulness of the forest returns, and you let out a sigh of relief, thankful to have woken up from this unsettling dream.
