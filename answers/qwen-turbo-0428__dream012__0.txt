You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you feel the weight of every decision pressing down on you like the dark clouds above. The wind howls like a wounded beast, and the waves rise like mountains, crashing against the hull with relentless fury.

You shout orders over the roar of the tempest, your voice steady despite the chaos. "Trim the sails! Secure the rigging! Hold the course!" Your crew moves with practiced precision, their fear masked by discipline. But you know the real battle is not just against the storm—it's against the doubt that creeps into your mind.

Then, from the heart of the storm, a light appears. Not the flash of lightning, but something softer, golden, and ancient. It pulses in time with your heartbeat, guiding you toward a path through the chaos. You feel a strange calm settle over you, as if the storm itself is listening.

You steer the ship toward the light, and as you do, the sea begins to change. The waves grow calmer, the wind softens, and the sky clears just enough to reveal a vast, starlit expanse. The crew gasps in awe, and for the first time since the storm began, they smile.

As you sail into the unknown, you realize this was never just a storm—it was a test. And you, the captain, have passed.
