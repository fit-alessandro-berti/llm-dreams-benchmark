You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and **hesitate, sensing it is alive—a dormant pulse beneath its emptiness.**  

The air hums as your fingers brush its edge. Suddenly, the canvas drinks in the chaos around you: the cerulean swirls of the sky bleed into its frame, jagged gold shapes from the horizon dissolve into its depths, and your own shadow fractures, scattering across its surface like ink droplets in water.  

A whisper, not in words but in **color**, blooms from the center: a deep violet spirals outward, pulling you closer. You dip your hand into the paint of the world and drag it across the canvas. Where you touch, the landscape shifts—mountains ripple like liquid, trees unfurl into birds, and the ground becomes a mosaic of memories you’ve never lived.  

The canvas begins to breathe. It shows you a door made of smoke, a storm of clocks, a child laughing in a field of floating eyes. Each image *aches* with familiarity, yet slips away when you try to grasp it. You realize: this is not a painting you control. **It is a mirror.**  

A final stroke reveals your own face staring back—fractured, radiant, and smiling with too many teeth. The world around you dissolves into a thousand flickering possibilities. You wake up gasping, the taste of paint on your tongue and a strange certainty: **the canvas is still watching.**
