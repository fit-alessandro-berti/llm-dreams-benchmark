Suddenly, a massive wave crashes over the deck, soaking everyone in a salty deluge. You grip the wheel tighter, feeling the ship's timbers groan under the strain. Your crew's eyes are wide with fear—old sailors who've seen tempests before, but nothing like this apocalypse of wind and water. "Captain!" one shouts over the howl, "The mast is splintering!"

You bark orders with steely resolve: "Secure the sails! Man the pumps! We're riding this out, lads—no godforsaken storm takes us down!" Lightning splits the sky, illuminating jagged rocks ahead like the teeth of a beast. In a flash of inspiration, you yank the wheel hard to port, veering the ship into a narrow channel through the swells. The crew rallies, tying off lines and heaving together.

As dawn breaks through the receding storm clouds, the sea calms to a restless swell. Exhausted but triumphant, you survey the horizon—a shimmering coastline appears, promising safety. Your crew cheers, their faith in you unbroken. But in the dream's twist, you awaken on deck, not as captain, but as the ship itself, rooted in the ocean's depths, forever weathering eternity's gales. The storm ends, but the voyage... never does. You've become the eternal sailor, dreaming of calm shores that fade with every wave.
