\boxed{You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to check your pockets and find a smartphone. A wave of relief washes over you as you unlock it and frantically scroll through your emails. "Meeting," you type into the search bar. An email from your assistant appears, dated last week. "Meeting with Mr. Thompson at 10 AM. Address: 1234 Elm Street, 22nd floor, Suite B."

You pull up a maps app and type in the address. The app indicates that the meeting place is a 30-minute subway ride away, followed by a 10-minute walk. You need to act fast. With a determined stride, you make your way to the nearest subway station, which is a few blocks away. 

The subway station is a flurry of activity. You quickly purchase a ticket and dart through the turnstiles. The train arrives just as you make it to the platform, and you board with minutes to spare. As the train zips through the city, you try to calm your nerves by going over your presentation. 

Twenty-nine minutes later, you emerge from the subway and follow the map app's directions through a part of the city filled with sleek office buildings. The app tells you that you need to make a left on Elm Street. You turn onto a street lined with tall, modern buildings until you reach number 1234—a towering skyscraper with a grand entrance.

Entering the building, you make your way to the front desk where a receptionist greets you. "Good morning, how may I help you?" she asks with a professional smile. 

"Good morning. I have a meeting with Mr. Thompson on the 22nd floor, Suite B," you reply.

"Certainly, sir. You'll need a visitor's pass. Please sign in here," she says, handing you a clipboard. 

After signing in and receiving your pass, you head to the elevators. The ride up to the 22nd floor feels like an eternity, but the elevator doors finally open, revealing a well-decorated lobby. You find Suite B and check the time—9:55 AM. You made it with five minutes to spare.

Taking a deep breath, you knock on the door and step inside, ready for your meeting. 

The dream leaves you with a sense of accomplishment and relief as you successfully navigate the unfamiliar city and make it to your important meeting on time.}
