…puzzles that feel less like tests and more like mirrors.

At first, the competition looks normal: bright banners, a polished stage, a panel of judges with earpieces and expressionless smiles. Everyone wears the same badge—your name printed in a font you don’t recognize—and the grand prize is described in a single sentence on a huge screen:

**THE JOB YOU WANT MOST.**

The first challenge is simple. A door labeled **RESUMÉ** swings open into a hallway lined with glass display cases. Inside each case is a version of your life: accomplishments you remember, and a few you don’t. One case holds an award you never received in waking life. Another holds a resignation letter you never wrote. Your task is to choose three items to bring forward.

You reach for the “right” ones, the safe ones, the impressive ones—but your hand keeps passing through the glass like mist. Only three objects have weight:

- a worn notebook with pages half-filled,
- a small key with no teeth,
- and a folded piece of paper that feels warm, like it was just held.

When you unfold the paper, it’s blank—until your fingers hover over it, and words appear in your own handwriting:

**“I’m afraid I’ll get it and still feel behind.”**

A bell rings. The judges nod as if that’s a correct answer.

The second challenge is a group task. The room resembles an open-plan office, except every desk is made of sand. Competitors scramble to build something stable: schedules, strategies, miniature towers labeled with buzzwords—**IMPACT**, **LEADERSHIP**, **INNOVATION**—but everything collapses the moment they stop touching it.

You’re given a timer, a whiteboard, and a single instruction:

**“Build a team.”**

You try to assign roles, but each time you point to someone, your finger leaves a smudge of ink on their sleeve, and they turn slightly translucent. The more you treat them like pieces on a board, the less real they become.

So you stop. You pull your chair into a circle, not facing the whiteboard, and ask the nearest person what they actually want. Their badge flickers, and for a moment it shows their real name. They exhale like they’ve been holding their breath for years. Someone laughs—quiet, surprised. The sand desks firm up, grain by grain, becoming wood. The open-plan room steadies into something you could work in for a long time.

The judges scribble notes. One of them leans toward their microphone, then seems to think better of it, as if the rules don’t fully apply to what you just did.

The third challenge is a maze. Not a physical maze, but a calendar.

You step into a corridor made of stacked days: Mondays like bricks, weekends like thin sheets of paper. Every time you turn a corner, you’re confronted with a door labeled with something that has stolen your time before:

**EMAIL.**  
**PERFECTION.**  
**PEOPLE-PLEASING.**  
**SECOND-GUESSING.**

You can open any door, but the moment you do, you’re pulled into a looping scene. Behind **EMAIL**, you’re replying to a message that regenerates as soon as you hit send. Behind **PERFECTION**, you’re polishing a single sentence until it becomes meaningless. Behind **PEOPLE-PLEASING**, you’re nodding so much your neck aches. Behind **SECOND-GUESSING**, you watch yourself walk away from a decision, then walk back, then away again.

In the middle of the calendar-maze, you find a small service elevator with no label. Inside is a button that simply says:

**ENOUGH.**

You press it.

The elevator doesn’t move, but the walls become transparent. You see the whole maze at once—how many routes there are, how few are necessary. Somewhere far below, you glimpse the notebook you chose earlier, the one half-filled, waiting without urgency.

A voice comes through a speaker overhead, gentle and oddly familiar:

“Do you want the job, or do you want the version of yourself you think deserves it?”

You try to answer, but the elevator opens before you can.

The final stage is back where it started: the polished auditorium, the banner, the judges. But now the audience seats are occupied by people you recognize from every era of your life—teachers, friends, strangers from old jobs, even someone you forgot you once tried to impress. They’re not clapping. They’re just watching, calm and unthreatening, like they’ve come to see a weather report.

A curtain rises behind the judges, revealing the grand prize.

It isn’t a corner office, or a title, or even a paycheck number glowing in neon.

It’s a room.

Your room—though you don’t have it in waking life. There’s light that doesn’t glare. There’s quiet that isn’t lonely. There’s a desk with the worn notebook already open, and a chair that looks like it was chosen for your body specifically. A window shows a horizon that doesn’t demand anything from you.

A judge stands and reads from a card:

“Congratulations. This position requires:
- making decisions without guaranteeing they’ll be perfect,
- taking breaks without earning them first,
- speaking clearly even when someone might be disappointed,
- and continuing, consistently, even when you do not feel impressive.”

They look up.

“The salary is time.”

Another judge adds, almost reluctantly, “Benefits include: being able to leave work at work.”

You laugh, but it catches in your throat because you realize the room is real in the way dreams sometimes are—realer than waking. It’s not an escape. It’s a blueprint.

A final envelope slides across the judges’ table toward you. It seals itself shut every time you try to open it the usual way. The key you chose earlier—the toothless key—tugs at your pocket. You take it out and, without thinking, press it against the wax seal.

The wax melts.

Inside the envelope is a single sentence:

**“Your dream job is the one you can do without abandoning yourself.”**

The auditorium fades. The audience dissolves into soft static. The judges’ faces blur into the faces of people you’ve been afraid of disappointing, then blur further until they become simply… human.

You step into the room behind the curtain and sit at the desk. The notebook waits, patient. On the first blank line, you write one small, honest thing—something you can do today, something you can do imperfectly.

As soon as the ink hits the page, the room gently shifts, as if aligning with you.

You hear, very faintly, the sound of a starting bell—but it isn’t the bell of a competition.

It’s an alarm clock far away, trying not to startle you.

Before you wake, you glance at the window one last time. The horizon holds steady. It doesn’t recede when you look at it.

And you think, with surprising calm:

Maybe the prize wasn’t getting chosen.

Maybe it was choosing.
