…written in your own unmistakable handwriting—curly loops, ink blots, every quirk you recognize—yet you have no memory of writing them.  

1. “Define yourself without using words.”  
2. “Solve for x where x = the sound of snow melting.”  
3. “Show all work.”  

Your pulse quickens, but instead of a pencil you find a paint‑brush made of goose‑down feathers. The answer sheet is not paper at all; it is a pane of clear glass balanced on the desk. When you touch the brush to it, colors appear as ripples in water.

You try to write your name, but the letters drift apart like clouds, rearranging into questions you have asked yourself at 3 a.m. The proctor—an owl in a tweed jacket—hoots softly and points to a giant hourglass suspended above the class. The sand is falling upward.

Panic surges until you remember, dimly, that this is a dream. With that realization the classroom walls dissolve into a vast library whose shelves stretch into space. Each book bears the title of a different version of your future. You pluck one at random. Inside, every page is blank except the last, which reads:

“Whatever you write here becomes true.”

Suddenly the exam feels less like judgment and more like invitation. You dip the brush into your heartbeat—now a pool of light on the desk—and paint across the glass:

“I choose to learn forever.”

The owl nods, taps the hourglass, and the falling sand turns to glitter, filling the room with slow‑motion constellations. As the final grain rises, a bell chimes—deep, resonant, forgiving.

You wake with the echo of wings in your ears and the faint scent of ink and snow.
