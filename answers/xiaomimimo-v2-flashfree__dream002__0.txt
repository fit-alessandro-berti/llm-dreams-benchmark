...you instinctively quicken your pace, looking for shelter. The canopy above, once a gentle filter for the sunlight, becomes a dark, swirling ceiling of bruised purple and charcoal clouds. The wind picks up, no longer a soft whisper through the leaves, but a low, mournful howl that seems to be calling your name.

You spot a massive, ancient oak tree a few yards away. Its roots have buckled the earth, creating a hollowed-out alcove beneath its massive trunk, shielded by a curtain of thick, mossy vines. It looks like the only safe haven for miles.

You scramble inside just as the first drop of rain hits. It’s not water. It hits the ground outside with a sizzle, leaving behind a glowing, neon-blue residue. Then another falls, and another. Within seconds, the sky opens up, and it is pouring neon rain. The forest floor begins to shimmer with an eerie, electric light.

Curiosity overcomes fear. You reach a hand through the vines, letting the strange liquid run over your fingers. It doesn't burn; it feels cool and effervescent, like static electricity mixed with spring water. As the neon rain coats your skin, the world around you shifts. The sounds of the storm change into music—a deep, rhythmic bass line thumping in time with your own heartbeat.

Looking out, you see that the rain isn't just hitting the ground; it’s tracing things. Wherever a drop lands on a fern, the fern glows a bright, pulsing green. A spiderweb in the corner of your shelter catches the rain and becomes a glowing harp, each drop plucking a melodic note.

Suddenly, a creature emerges from the glowing bushes. It looks like a deer, but its antlers are made of braided lightning, crackling softly, and its eyes are solid orbs of silver. It walks gracefully through the neon downpour, unbothered. It stops just outside your shelter and turns its head toward you.

In its gaze, you don't feel judged, but you feel... *understood*. It lowers its head, offering you a single, glowing tear that has formed on its cheek. The tear floats through the air, suspended in the neon mist, waiting for you to take it.

What do you do?
