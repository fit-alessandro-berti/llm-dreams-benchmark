build a hidden garden in the ruins of an old library, where the shelves once groaned under the weight of forgotten stories. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and rusting metal, but you coax life from the cracks—seeds scavenged from a derelict greenhouse, watered with rainwater collected in cracked porcelain bathtubs. By day, you forage for scraps of sunlight filtering through shattered skylights, planting heirloom tomatoes that twist defiantly around the spines of tattered encyclopedias. At night, you whisper to the glowing fireflies you've lured in with jars of fermented fruit, their light mapping constellations on the pages of *The Secret Garden*.

Word spreads among the wanderers: a wanderer with a limp shares tales of your verdant sanctuary over a shared tin of beans, and soon, shadows gather at the library's vine-choked doors. Not raiders, but refugees—eyes hollow with hunger, hands callused from endless scavenging. You teach them the rhythm of the soil, how to graft apple scions onto wild rose roots, and in return, they bring fragments of the world you thought lost: a violin strung with fishing line, seeds of lavender from a bombed-out botanical archive, a child's laughter echoing off the walls for the first time in years.

But dreams have teeth. One storm-lashed evening, as thunder cracks like rifle fire, a pack of feral dogs—sleek shadows with eyes like embers—circles the perimeter, drawn by the scent of ripening bounty. You arm yourself with a makeshift spear from a broom handle and rebar, heart pounding in sync with the rain. The garden holds its breath as you stand guard, the first green shoots at your feet a fragile testament to your choice. In that moment, amid the howl and deluge, you realize the apocalypse wasn't the end of the world, but the brutal forge of a new one—one where you, the dreamer, plant not just seeds, but hope.

And then, as the dogs slink away into the gloom, the first rays of dawn pierce the clouds. You wake, the echo of soil under your nails lingering on your skin, wondering if the garden still blooms in some corner of your mind.
