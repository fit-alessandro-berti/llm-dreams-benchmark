Certainly! Here’s the continuation of your dream:

---

You weave through the crowd, the hum of laughter and clinking glasses wrapping around you like a fog. The room is a kaleidoscope of strangers—some in vibrant costumes, others blending into the shadows. You spot a group near a marble column, their hands fluttering as they juggle glowing orbs that leave trails of stardust. One orb drifts toward you, and when you catch it, it dissolves into a whisper: *“Look closer.”* 

You move on, past a cluster of people hunched over a table with a giant, broken clock face. They’re passing around a single golden gear, each slotting it into a different spot, but the clock never starts. A woman in a top hat turns to you, her eyes hollow but warm. *“Time isn’t linear here,”* she says, then vanishes. 

At the far end of the room, a group stands in a circle, their conversation entirely silent. They communicate through exaggerated gestures—fingers spelling words in the air, hands tracing shapes on invisible canvases. You mimic their motions, trying to ask about your friend, but the gestures twist into something unrecognizable. A child in the circle giggles and points toward a door you hadn’t noticed before, its surface rippling like water. 

You push through the crowd, heart pounding, and finally spot them—standing alone in a sunlit garden that shouldn’t exist indoors. They’re tending a flowerbed where roses bloom in impossible colors, their petals soft as smoke. But as you call their name, they turn, and their face shifts into a mosaic of everyone you’ve passed in the room. 

Before you can speak, the floor tilts, and the garden dissolves into a starry sky. You’re falling now, weightless, toward a door floating mid-air. It opens to reveal not your friend, but a mirror reflecting a version of yourself you’ve never seen. 

You wake with the taste of stardust on your tongue and the faint echo of a clock ticking backward.
