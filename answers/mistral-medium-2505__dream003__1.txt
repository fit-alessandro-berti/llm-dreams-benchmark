symbols etched into its surface—some resembling ancient runes, others like celestial constellations. The box hums faintly, as if alive, and the air around it shimmers with an otherworldly energy.

Just as you’re about to give up, a whisper brushes against your ear—a voice you don’t recognize but somehow trust. *"The key is not outside, but within."* Confused, you press your palm against the box’s surface. To your shock, the patterns glow beneath your touch, rearranging themselves into a familiar shape: the outline of your own hand.

The box clicks open.

Inside, you find not treasure or answers, but a mirror—one that doesn’t reflect your face. Instead, it shows a version of you standing in a vast, unfamiliar landscape, holding the very same box. The dreamer and the dreamed blur together as the box in the mirror begins to glow, and the whisper returns: *"Now you see."*

Suddenly, you wake up—or do you? The line between the dream and reality feels thinner than ever.
