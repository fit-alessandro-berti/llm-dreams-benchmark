The questions are *alive*.  

As you unfold the exam paper, the first question stares up at you: *"Calculate the volume of a cube whose edges are made of time."* The numbers on the page shimmer, their digits flickering like candles. You scribble equations, but the symbols twist into letters, forming a riddle instead: *"How many seconds does it take for a shadow to forget its shape?"*  

The second question is a diagram of a clock face, but the hands are made of liquid mercury. Beneath it reads: *"Draw the path of the hour hand if the minute hand is afraid of the number 7."* Your pencil hovers, but the paper grows warm. When you glance up, the proctor—a figure with no face—whispers, *"Think in metaphors."*  

By the third question, the room itself shifts. The walls dissolve into a starry sky, and the question floats above you: *"What color is the silence between heartbeats?"* Your pen spills ink that smells like burnt cinnamon, and the letters you write dissolve into moths.  

You realize the exam isn’t about answers—it’s about *how you lose control*. The final question appears only when you panic: *"Describe the weight of a memory you’ve never had."*  

Suddenly, the clock on the wall ticks backward. Your pencil snaps. The paper bleeds a single sentence: *"Your career is the question you ask after waking."*  

You wake with your hand still clutching a nonexistent pencil, the taste of graphite and possibility on your tongue.
