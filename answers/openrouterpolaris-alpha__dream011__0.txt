…alive.

Not printed. Not typed. Alive.

Lines of ink pull themselves up from the paper like centipedes made of punctuation. The questions slither, rearrange, whisper among themselves.

One of them peels its serifed letters free and looks at you.

“Are you sure,” it says, “this is the right test?”

You blink. The rest of the room is frozen: rows of students motionless, their pens hovering, a professor at the front caught mid-step, mouth open on a permanent “You may begin.” Only your exam is moving.

You look down again. The first question finishes growing.

1. Write the answer you were afraid to say out loud when you first chose this career.

The answer box is deep. Deeper than the page. You lean closer; it smells like rain, photocopier toner, and your old bedroom. You feel if you drop your pen, it will fall for miles.

You think you should raise your hand. Ask for another paper. Ask for a normal exam. But your arm is heavy, like it belongs to one of the frozen students.

The second question unsticks itself and stretches.

2. Without lying, explain the moment you decided this path mattered more than being loved.

You flinch. That one hits something. But your name at the top of the page is not your name. It’s every nickname, every mispronunciation, every version of you that tried to fit into other people’s plans. The letters cycle like a slot machine: your given name, your email handle, the name you almost chose for yourself at thirteen and then buried.

You look around again. The other exams are blank. No moving ink. No questions. No one else seems panicked; they are perfectly still, like mannequins holding their breath.

“Eyes on your own paper,” murmurs a question, though the professor’s lips never move.

The third one forms slowly, in careful script, as if not to scare you.

3. Describe, in detail, the life you would live if you failed this test and no one was disappointed. Show your work.

There’s a diagram now, an impossible branching tree. Some branches are labeled with jobs you’ve never heard yourself say out loud. Some are feelings: Relief. Hunger. Quiet mornings. One is simply labeled Not This.

Your heart starts pounding. You never studied for this. You studied formulas, dates, case law, metabolic pathways, market trends, definitions, rubrics. You never studied for:

4. Circle all the sacrifices you’ve already made but refuse to acknowledge.

Around the question appear little icons: your spine hunched over a desk at 3 a.m.; your friends’ names with missed calls beside them; the outline of someone who once held your hand at the bus stop; a guitar with dust on the strings; a younger you with paint on your fingers.

Every time you look at an icon, it burns a little darker.

“I can’t answer this,” you whisper.

The entire page pauses. The crawling letters flatten, listening.

“Correct,” says Question 5, which hasn’t even finished appearing yet, but somehow has an opinion. “Show your reasoning.”

You try to stand up. Your chair doesn’t move. Your legs aren’t legs; they’re roots braided through tile and concrete and standardized test forms. You think: I don’t belong here. The room smells like sharpened pencils and fear.

At the front, the clock’s hands spin too fast, then too slow, then counterclockwise. Time is drunk.

You force your fingers closed around the pen. It melts into a key: your old house key, your dorm key, all the doors you’ve walked through without deciding where they led. You set it to the page. Instead of writing, it unlocks the paper like a hatch.

The exam opens.

Beneath the thin layer of questions there is a second page, darker, pulsing with faint light. Words grow there too, but they aren’t confrontational. They’re patient, like instructions you were supposed to receive years ago.

New text surfaces:

1. What do you believe your life is for, when you forget anyone is watching?

2. Which mistake would you rather live with: choosing wrong on your own terms, or never choosing at all?

3. Name three things that make you feel vividly, uncomplicatedly alive. (These are not extra credit.)

The room temperature shifts. The frozen students flicker, as if they’re projections on old film, then stabilize again, still statues, still stuck in someone else’s test.

You realize: they might not be people. They might be all the versions of you that took the exam as it was given and never looked down long enough to see it breathing.

The original questions coil restlessly at the page’s edge, offended at being peeled back.

“You studied for us,” they hiss. “You memorized us. We fit on syllabi. We come with grading rubrics.”

“We are safe,” one adds, smug.

The new questions do not argue. They only wait.

You know—because dreams feel like knowing—that if you answer the living questions, the exam can’t be graded by their metrics. There will be no neat red score at the top. You might fail out of the life that was built around solving other people’s problems with the least amount of yourself showing.

You also know that not answering means waking up in a future you allowed to happen by default.

The clock over the board coughs out a sound like a projector bulb dying.

“Time,” says the professor, finally completing the word.

Students around you lift their pens, but none of them have written anything. Their pages are spotless. Their faces are featureless now.

“Collect your exams,” the professor says.

Your paper stares up. You haven’t written a single official answer. The only thing you’ve done is unlock it.

The professor approaches your desk. Only now, looking up, you realize their face keeps flickering: teacher, parent, boss, stranger on a plane, guidance counselor, your own reflection in a bathroom mirror at 2 a.m. Every authority you’ve ever thought knew better.

They reach for your exam.

You act without thinking.

You put your hand flat on the page.

Ink surges up, up your arm, under your skin. The questions imprint along your veins, luminous. Not the standardized ones. The real ones. The ones that felt like trespass.

“Not yet,” you hear yourself say, though your voice is layered with others—child-you, future-you, all the half-lived lives clearing their throats at once.

The professor recoils as if burned. The room begins to tilt; the desks slide slowly toward a vanishing point that isn’t there. The featureless students crumble into blank pages, fluttering upward like startled birds.

“Leaving it incomplete is an automatic failure,” the old questions screech, clinging to the edges of the exam, desperate.

You look down at them, and for the first time, you’re not afraid.

“Oh,” you say. “Then I choose to fail this.”

The word choose detonates quietly.

The ceiling dissolves. Fluorescent lights unhook and become stars. The ugly exam hall stretches into a sky you recognize from childhood nights when you still thought anything was possible. The desks elongate into doorways. Each doorway opens onto a different scene:

- You, tired but content, doing work that doesn’t impress anyone at reunions but lets you sleep at night.
- You, in a tiny apartment that hums with plants and music, no prestige, but color everywhere.
- You, still figuring it out at forty, and it’s okay.
- You, in a version of the original career, but slower, kinder, not built from fear.

“Pick one,” the old training in your mind insists. “Quickly. Optimize.”

But the living ink along your arms warms, and a quieter truth rises: you don’t have to know the whole answer. You just have to stop letting the wrong questions grade you.

The professor—now only a silhouette—tries again. “Your time is up.”

You stand. This time, your legs obey.

“That’s not how this works,” you reply, surprised to hear how steady you sound. “This is my dream.”

You do something outrageously illegal in exam rooms everywhere.

You take the paper with you.

As you step through the nearest doorway, the last thing you see are the old questions shrinking, becoming small, printed, harmless—just words on dead paper.

You wake up with your heart pounding, the ghost of ink still tingling along your forearms, one sentence echoing as if you’d really written it:

“I refuse to let my life be determined by questions I never had a say in.”

And for a fragile, crucial moment before the day sweeps you up, you remember that the exam was never actually about what you knew.

It was about whether you’d notice it was wrong.
