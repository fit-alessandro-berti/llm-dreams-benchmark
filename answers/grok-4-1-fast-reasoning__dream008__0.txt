You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you freeze, staring at the stack of papers that multiply like rabbits on your desk. "It's due in five minutes!" he bellows, his tie unraveling into a snake that slithers toward you.

You dive in, fingers flying over the keyboard, but the words twist into gibberish—equations solving themselves backward, spreadsheets blooming into fields of poppies. The clock spins wildly, hands melting like Dali's watch. Your boss grows taller, sprouting antlers, demanding pie charts of your soul.

Colleagues morph into cheering mascots, pelting you with rubber chickens labeled "URGENT." You hit "print," and out comes a flock of origami birds carrying memos that dissolve in the air. The deadline hits—zero o'clock—and the office erupts in fireworks of shredded deadlines.

You wake up gasping, tangled in sheets, the alarm blaring like a victory fanfare. Just a dream... or is that your laptop glowing on the nightstand?
