You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **plant a single, fragile seedling you found preserved in an old glass jar.**

The wind howls through the skeletal remains of skyscrapers, carrying the scent of rust and dry ash. Your water ration is low, just enough to keep you alive for another day, and the shadow of a scavenger drone flickers momentarily against the grey clouds above. Logic screams at you to drink the water, to hide, to survive another night by doing nothing but enduring.

But as you look at the tiny green shoot, its leaves trembling slightly in the toxic breeze, you realize that mere survival isn't living. You kneel in the cracked concrete, using a jagged piece of rebar to dig a small hole. With trembling hands, you pour half your water onto the dry, lifeless soil. Then, you gently place the seedling inside and cover its roots with dirt you've sifted through your fingers.

You sit back on your heels, guarding this small patch of earth as the sun begins to set, casting long, bloody streaks across the horizon. You don't know if it will grow. You don't know if you'll be here tomorrow to see it. But in a world defined by ending things, you have chosen, defiantly and quietly, to begin something new. For the first time in years, the future doesn't feel like a countdown; it feels like a possibility.
