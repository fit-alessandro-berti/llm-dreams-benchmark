…feel your stomach drop, but before you can stammer out an excuse, your boss reaches across the desk, lifts a small glass orb from the stack of folders, and rolls it toward you. It’s filled with liquid silver that ripples like mercury even though the air is still.  

“Don’t worry about the deadline,” they say softly. “Just keep the orb steady. Every second you hesitate, the project extends itself.”  

You look down. The orb is cool in your palms, but your hands are suddenly submerged in slow-moving water that smells faintly of old paper and thunder. Each heartbeat sends a ripple through the silver surface, and on those ripples you see tiny, looping scenes: a stapler sprouting leaves, memos folding themselves into paper cranes, the office carpet breathing like a slow lung.  

Your boss smiles, steps back, and turns off the lights. The only illumination is the orb, now pulsing softly in time with your pulse. “Don’t try to finish,” they whisper. “Just keep it orbiting your thoughts. If it ever stops glowing red, the deadline will snap shut like a trap—and everyone will blame you.”  

You realize the paperwork on the desk has melted into黏稠, black treacle. The glass orb rises an inch, floating in the air like a trapped star. You hear your coworkers’ laughter echoing from impossible distances, and you notice the walls of your cubicle are curving outward, becoming a vast, sloping tunnel of whiteboard.  

Somewhere in the distance, a digital clock starts counting down from 00:00:00.
