The partygoers fade into the background, and for a moment, it's just us, suspended in a sea of tranquility.

But as I look up at the stars, I begin to feel a sense of floating, and the dream starts to unravel. I'm drifting away from my friend, carried on a gentle breeze, and the party disappears, leaving behind only the memory of sparkling feathers and the taste of that intoxicating liquid...
