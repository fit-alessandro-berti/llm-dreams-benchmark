# The Impossible Deadline Dream

You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you realize your computer won't turn on. You press the power button repeatedly, but instead of booting up, it starts melting like ice cream on a hot day. Your boss doesn't seem to notice, continuing to check their watch impatiently.

When you try to explain the problem, your voice comes out as a whisper. The office begins filling with water, but everyone keeps working as if nothing is happening. The stack of papers on your desk multiplies every time you look away, reaching toward the ceiling.

Suddenly, you're in the conference room presenting your completed project, though you have no memory of working on it. Your slides are blank, but your colleagues are nodding appreciatively. Your boss transforms into your elementary school teacher who always said you weren't living up to your potential.

You try to exit the room, but the door keeps leading back to your desk where that impossible project awaits, the deadline clock somehow showing less time than before.
