Here’s a completion of your dream, weaving in vivid imagery and an underlying sense of mystery or transformation:  
---  
Your feet carry you through a cavernous ballroom with ceilings that swirl like liquid gold. The air hums with laughter and the clink of glasses, but every face blurs like wet watercolor as you pass. The group you first approach—a cluster of strangers in masks shaped like animals—reaches out to touch your sleeves, asking, *“Have you seen the Gardener?”* before dissolving into smoke.  

You turn, heart pounding, and find yourself in a garden where the flowers glow like fireflies. A woman in a dress made of autumn leaves steps forward, her voice echoing as if from a distant canyon: *“They’re looking for you too, you know.”* Before you can ask who, she crumbles into a flock of sparrows.  

A staircase coils upward, spiraling into darkness. You climb, each step creaking like a whispered secret. At the top, a single figure waits by a window strewn with constellations. Their back is to you, but as they turn, their face shifts—first familiar, then alien, then familiar again. They hold out a hand, and the world tilts.  

*“You’re late,”* they say, but their voice is your own.  

And then you wake, the taste of stardust on your tongue.
