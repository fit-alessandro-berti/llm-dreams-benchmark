...settle this once and for all.

The room around you, your friend's familiar, sunlit kitchen, begins to waver at the edges, the colours bleeding like watercolour on wet paper. Your friend’s face, contorted with anger a moment ago, softens into a look of solemn understanding. They nod, not at you, but at the idea that has just bloomed, silent and fully formed, between you.

"The only way," they say, and their voice no longer sounds angry, but distant, as if echoing from the end of a long tunnel.

You decide to race.

But not a normal race. The goal is to reach the old willow tree at the bottom of the garden of your shared childhood home. The catch is that you can only move by stepping on memories.

Instantly, the kitchen floor dissolves into a shimmering, grassy field under a twilight sky you've never seen before. The air is thick and smells of ozone and cut grass. The willow tree is there, impossibly far away, its branches swaying gently despite the lack of wind.

Your friend takes the first step. A flat, grey paving slab materializes under their foot. "The time you broke my favourite mug," they say, and the memory hangs in the air, cold and sharp. They take another step, onto a patch of dried, cracking mud. "The day you forgot my birthday."

You have to move. You reach for a memory of your own, a justification. A small, thorny patch of brambles appears. "That's because you told everyone my secret," you project, not with your voice, but with your mind. The thorns prick your bare feet as you step on it. It hurts, but it moves you forward.

The race is a tapestry of pain and justification. Your friend steps on the glistening, tear-wet stone of a forgotten promise. You counter by stepping on the brittle, dead leaves of a time they let you down. With every step, the willow tree gets no closer. You are both advancing, but the landscape stretches, keeping the goal perpetually out of reach. The field is now littered with these moments—shards of broken glass, patches of slippery ice, sucking pools of mud—a hazardous mosaic of your shared history.

You are both breathing heavily, exhausted not from the physical effort, but from the emotional weight of it all. You look at your friend, their face streaked with sweat and tears, and you see they are struggling just as much as you are. Their last step, onto a memory of a particularly cruel word, causes them to stumble.

In that moment, the competition feels utterly pointless. Winning means nothing if it means leaving them behind on a field of our own making.

You stop. Instead of reaching for another grievance, another thorny branch or sharp stone to propel you forward, you reach for something else. You think of the time you both laughed so hard that milk came out of your noses.

Beneath your feet, a patch of soft, vibrant green moss appears. It’s cool and comforting.

You don't step on it.

Instead, you gesture for your friend to use it. They look at you, confused. You focus harder, pushing the memory towards them. They tentatively place their foot on the moss, and a small sigh of relief escapes their lips.

They understand. They look at you, and this time, their eyes are clear. They conjure a memory of you sitting with them all night in a hospital waiting room. A smooth, warm, sun-drenched stone appears next to your moss patch.

You don't race to the tree. Instead, you start building a path, together. A memory of singing badly in the car becomes a sturdy plank. A memory of a shared secret becomes a beautiful, intricate mosaic tile. You work in silence, bridging the gaps, laying down a solid, walkable path made not of your arguments, but of your affection.

You don't know if you ever reach the willow tree. It doesn't seem to matter anymore. You just know that the ground beneath your feet is firm, and your friend is right beside you. The air is clear now, and you can hear the faint sound of birdsong as the strange twilight begins to brighten into a gentle dawn.
