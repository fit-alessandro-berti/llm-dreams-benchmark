You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find water—*and fast*.**  

Your throat is parched, your lips cracked. The air smells of damp earth, woodsmoke, and something wild—*not* the filtered scent of city parks or AC vents. Sunlight dapples through a canopy of unfamiliar trees, their leaves broad and veined like old parchment. In the distance, a low, rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* echoes—possibly a watermill, or a hammer on anvil—but no roads. No wires. No engines. Just birdsong, rustling ferns, and the distant murmur of something moving *toward* you.

You crouch beside a moss-covered stone, running your fingers over its rough surface. Carved faintly into its flank is a symbol: a circle with a垂落 line and three dots beneath—like a river source or a well spring. A message? A warning?  

Then you hear it—a woman’s voice, soft but urgent, from behind a curtain of ivy:  
***“If you’re thirsty, drink only from the silver thread, and never when the crow caws thrice.”***  

A small, soot-smudged girl steps into the clearing, holding a wooden bucket. Her sandals are tied with twine, her hair braided with wildflowers. She tilts her head.  
***“You’re not from here. Your eyes… they hold no memory of the old songs.”***  

She offers you her bucket. Steam rises from it. The water inside is clear—but trembling.

What do you do?  

*(The dream isn’t over. You’re still *here*—and time is running out.)*
