…and it breathes once, as if the world were about to tell you a secret.

You put your palm to it. The surface is warm and faintly humming, like a seashell pressed to your ear. A brush drifts down from nowhere—a bristle of midnight tied to a handle of moonlight—or maybe it’s just your finger, because in this place tools remember what they’re for and become them.

The first touch leaves sound instead of color: a low note that tastes like oranges. The second touch spills a soft green that smells like rain on metal. Triangles hum when you draw them; circles whisper when you set them down. Each stroke changes the landscape behind you—mountains uncurl, staircases settle, a kite reels in its own string.

You decide to paint a door. Not a door you’ve seen, but the idea of a door: hinge, threshold, the pause before crossing. The canvas drinks it, widens, and becomes tall enough to step through. On the other side is the back of the painting—splinters, threads, a scaffolding of quiet—which is somehow also a beach. The tide is letters. Waves gather into words, foam into sentences, then flatten into blank pages that slide back out to sea.

Something steps up from the surf, wearing the colors you haven’t mixed yet. It looks like you if you were still learning how to draw yourself. It offers you a tin of pigments labeled with feelings instead of names: Resolve, Slight Regret, The Laugh You Forgot, A Very Specific Shade of Tomorrow.

“Choose one,” it says, but its mouth doesn’t move; the choice is already in your hand. You pick Tomorrow. It’s lighter than you expect. When you open it, the world stops changing for the length of a breath. A tree holds still long enough to cast a dependable shadow. A bench remembers it is a bench. The sky agrees to be blue without negotiation.

“Every dream gets one rule,” says the not-quite-you, and you realize this is yours: for a moment, something may remain.

You test it. You paint a small window into the canvas—four panes, a latch, a strip of chipped white. Through it, you see a room you almost recognize: a mug with a hairline crack, a plant leaning toward a stubborn sunbeam, a key on a dish. You reach in and take the key. It is heavier than the tin and warmer than the canvas. It has no teeth, just a single, clean edge.

“What does it open?” you ask.

“It opens,” says the other you. “That’s enough.”

You pocket the key and paint the window shut, not unkindly. Then you set down the brush that may be your finger and look back at the door. You could walk deeper, or you could sign the corner and go. You sign it not with your name, but with a small line drawn exactly where the horizon would be if the world settled. The line becomes a path.

You step onto it.

The colors around you loosen again. Shapes renegotiate their outlines. But the pocket with the key feels steady—like a small, steady weight tugging you toward waking.

Behind you, the canvas folds itself into a paper crane and perches on your shoulder. It is blank again, but not empty. It tilts its head toward your ear, waiting.

“What now?” you ask.

“Next,” it says, and the word is a doorway, and you carry it with you into morning.
