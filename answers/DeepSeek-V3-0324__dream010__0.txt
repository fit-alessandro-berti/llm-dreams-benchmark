As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and unexpected twists. The first task is a high-pressure coding marathon, where you must debug a complex algorithm under a tight deadline. The lines of code blur together, but you push through, your fingers flying across the keyboard as logic and creativity merge seamlessly.  

Next, you find yourself in a surreal puzzle room—walls covered in shifting symbols, equations floating in the air. The key to escaping lies in solving a riddle:  

*"I speak without a mouth, run without legs, and grow stronger with time. What am I?"*  

You pause, then smile—**an echo**. The door slides open.  

The final challenge is a debate against an AI that knows every counterargument. But instead of fighting, you ask it: *"What’s the one question you can’t answer?"* The AI stutters, its logic loops collapsing—victory is yours.  

As the crowd cheers, the prize materializes: a glowing contract for your dream job. But just as you reach for it, you wake up—heart racing, the echo of the competition still lingering. Was it real? Or just a test of what you’re truly capable of?
