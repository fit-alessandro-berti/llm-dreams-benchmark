**Dream Continuation:**

…not the lectures, textbooks, or case studies you’ve studied all semester. Instead, each page is blank except for a single, shifting question, written in silver ink that wriggles like liquid. The first reads: *"What would you create if failure meant nothing, and success meant everything?"*  

You scribble a response—something about building a bridge between worlds, or composing a song that makes forgotten memories feel alive—when the page dissolves. The next question appears: *"Name three things you’ve buried (literally or otherwise). Are you sure they’re dead?"*  

Your pen hovers. The room around you begins to blur, the desks melting into sand, the clock on the wall ticking backward. A voice, not quite heard but *felt*, murmurs, *"Time is a suggestion here."*  

The third question materializes in your hand, now floating in midair: *"If your career were a weather pattern, what storm or season would you be? Warn us… or reassure us."*  

Panic flickers. You glance around, but the other students are gone, replaced by shadowy figures holding mirrors. Each reflection shows a version of you—laughing in a lab coat, silent behind a painter’s smock, shouting truths from a protest line. The figures tilt their heads, as if waiting for you to choose which mirror to step into.  

Suddenly, the exam paper reforms, now bearing a final question in bold: *"What are you afraid this exam will reveal?"*  

You freeze. The pen grows warm, then glows. As you write, the words sear into the air, reshaping the room. The ceiling becomes a night sky, and the desks regrow into trees. When you look down, your hands are no longer holding a pen—but a seed.  

The proctor, now a child with eyes like galaxies, smiles and says, *"The test was never about answers. Only planting them."*  

You wake just in time to hear your alarm—but the seed is still in your palm, pulsing faintly.
