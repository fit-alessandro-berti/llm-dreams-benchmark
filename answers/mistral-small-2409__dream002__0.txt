As you feel the first drops of rain, the wind picks up, rustling the leaves above and sending a chill down your spine. The sky darkens rapidly, the once clear blue now a ominous shade of gray. You quicken your pace, trying to find some shelter, but the forest seems to be thinning out, and there's no sign of a cozy cabin or even a large tree to huddle under.

Suddenly, you hear a low growl behind you. You turn around, heart pounding in your chest, and see a massive wolf, its fur as dark as the storm clouds, eyes glowing like distant lightning. It snarls again, baring its teeth, and takes a step towards you. You back away slowly, hands up in a futile attempt to placate the beast.

Just as the wolf is about to lunge, a bright flash of lightning illuminates the forest, and a figure appears between you and the wolf. It's a person, dressed in a long, hooded cloak, their face obscured by the hood. They hold out a hand, and the wolf stops in its tracks, growling but no longer advancing.

"Go," the figure says, their voice echoing like thunder. "Run."

You don't need to be told twice. You turn and sprint through the forest, the storm raging around you, the wolf's growls fading behind you. You don't know where you're going, but you know you have to keep moving. The rain is pouring now, the wind howling like a pack of wolves. You can barely see, but you press on, desperate to escape the forest and the storm.

Finally, after what feels like hours, you see a faint light up ahead. You stumble towards it, your clothes soaked and your breath coming in ragged gasps. As you reach the edge of the forest, you realize the light is coming from a small cottage, its windows glowing warmly against the dark night.

You knock on the door, and it creaks open, revealing an old woman with a kind face. "Come in, come in," she says, ushering you inside. "You're safe now."

As you step inside, the storm outside seems to lessen, the growls of the wolf fading into the distance. You're safe, for now, but you know this dream is far from over.
