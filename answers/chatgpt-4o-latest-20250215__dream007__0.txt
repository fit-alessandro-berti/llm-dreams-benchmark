step outside to cool off. The air is thick and humid, charged with the lingering energy of the argument. Streetlights flicker as you pace down the sidewalk, replaying the conversation in your mind, searching for the moment where everything went wrong.

Then, something strange happens.

The world around you begins to blur, colors melting into one another like wet paint on a canvas. The street bends in ways that defy logic, and suddenly, you're not outside your friend's house anymore. You're in a vast, empty theater, the seats stretching endlessly into the darkness. A single spotlight shines on the stage.

Your friend is there, standing beneath the light. But they look... different. Their features shift and flicker, as if they are wearing multiple faces at once. Their voice echoes strangely as they speak.  

*"We were never really arguing, were we?"*  

A deep, unsettling realization washes over you. The argument wasn’t about what you thought it was. It wasn’t even real.  

You try to speak, but your voice catches in your throat. The theater begins to collapse in on itself, the walls folding like paper. A rushing sound fills your ears, growing louder, louder—  

And then, you wake up.
