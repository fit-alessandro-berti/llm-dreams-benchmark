...and you realize the compass in your hand isn’t pointing North, but toward a light glowing deep beneath the black swells. 

The wood of the wheel begins to soften under your grip, turning from gnarled oak into something that feels like warm skin. You try to shout an order to the boatswain, but when you open your mouth, no sound comes out—only a swarm of glowing dragonflies that spiral up into the gale, illuminating the rain.

The crew doesn’t panic. Instead, they begin to hum a low, resonant chord that vibrates in your chest. The ship doesn't crest the next wave; it breathes with it. As a mountain of water towers over the bow, a wall of glass and foam, you don’t turn away. You step onto the railing, sensing that the gravity of this world is merely a suggestion.

The wave crashes down, but it isn't cold. It tastes like woodsmoke and old memories. 

Suddenly, the ship is gone. You are standing in the center of a vast, silent ballroom made of coral, suspended in the eye of the storm. The "storm" is actually a swirl of millions of translucent pages from books you haven't read yet, circling you like a cyclone. 

You look down at your hands. They are made of starlight. You realize the ship wasn't meant to survive the storm—it was the shell you had to break to get here. You close your eyes, take a breath of the salt-sweet air, and as you exhale, the entire ocean turns into a field of tall, white grass, waving in a wind that finally feels like home. 

You aren't the captain anymore. You are the horizon. 

And then, you begin to wake.
