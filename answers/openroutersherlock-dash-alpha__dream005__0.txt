You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and each one pulls you into their bizarre orbit.

First, a cluster of laughing executives in pinstripe suits, sipping neon cocktails that glow like fireflies. They shove a microphone in your face: "Quick, pitch your wildest startup idea—winner gets a unicorn!" You mumble something about AI-powered socks that tie themselves, and they erupt in applause, dubbing you "Socksavior." But they're already forgetting you, turning to debate if Bitcoin is just dragon eggs.

Weaving away, you stumble into a circle of artists with paint-splattered faces, dancing around a giant canvas on the floor. "Join the chaos!" they cry, handing you a brush dipped in liquid stars. Your strokes turn into swirling galaxies, and suddenly the canvas ripples to life—tiny dream-creatures crawl out, nibbling your shoes. One whispers, "Follow the blue thread," and points toward a velvet curtain.

Pushing through, you enter a group of philosophers in togas, arguing in riddles under a chandelier of floating clocks. "If a tree falls in a forest and no one's there to hear it, does it dream of electric sheep?" one booms. You nod vigorously, and they anoint you with olive oil, declaring you the Oracle of Obvious Truths. A pocket watch slips into your hand, ticking backward.

The air thickens with smoke from a nearby hookah circle—mystics blowing smoke rings shaped like forgotten memories. They invite you to inhale, and visions flood in: your childhood bike riding itself uphill, lost loves waving from clouds. "The one you seek is the shadow behind the mirror," they chant, as the smoke forms a map leading to a glowing door.

Finally, you burst through, heart pounding, and there they are—your one familiar face, grinning amid a band of time travelers playing jazz on instruments made of light. "Took you long enough," they say, handing you a drink. "Dream's just getting started." The room spins, groups blending into a kaleidoscope, and you realize you're not lost—you're the party. Then the alarm fades in...
