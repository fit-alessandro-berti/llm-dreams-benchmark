find yourself standing before a towering wall of shimmering symbols, pulsating with a faint, otherworldly glow. The air hums with energy, and you feel a tingling sensation crawl up your spine. The symbols twist and shift before your eyes, forming patterns that seem just beyond comprehension. You realize this isn’t just a puzzle of logic—it’s a test of intuition and perception too. 
Reaching out, you trace a finger along one of the glowing lines, and the wall ripples like water. A single symbol detaches itself, floating in midair, and you instinctively know it’s a key. But to what? You glance around, noticing three distinct paths branching from this chamber: one lined with mirrors reflecting distorted versions of yourself, another shrouded in a thick, swirling mist, and the third echoing with faint whispers that tug at your curiosity.
You clutch the symbol-key tightly, its warmth pulsing in your hand, and decide to take the misty path. As you step forward, the fog thickens, wrapping around you like a living thing. Shapes begin to emerge—vague silhouettes of people or creatures, you can’t quite tell. They murmur riddles in unison, their voices overlapping: “I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?” 
Your mind races. The answer feels close, teasing the edges of your thoughts. “An echo,” you say aloud, and the mist parts slightly, revealing a stone pedestal with a slot perfectly shaped for the symbol-key. You place it in, and with a low rumble, the ground shifts beneath you. The maze is changing again, walls sliding and reforming, pulling you deeper into its heart.
Now, you stand in a circular room with no exits, the walls covered in intricate gears and levers. In the center, a pedestal holds a single, glowing orb. You approach it, and as your fingers brush its surface, the dream shifts—suddenly, you’re no longer alone. A figure cloaked in shadow stands across from you, its voice a low whisper: “One final choice. Solve the maze, or become part of it.” The orb pulses faster, and you feel the weight of the decision pressing down. What do you do next?
