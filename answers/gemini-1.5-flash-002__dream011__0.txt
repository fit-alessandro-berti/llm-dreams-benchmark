...not written in words.  Instead, they're presented as a series of bizarre, shifting landscapes painted on the exam paper itself.  One question is a swirling vortex of purple and orange, crackling with unseen energy.  Another is a serene, snow-capped mountain range that seems to subtly alter its shape as I look at it.  A third is an endless, star-dusted ocean reflecting a sky filled with impossible constellations.

Panic bubbles up inside me.  I’m supposed to *answer* these... things?  How? With words? With paintings of my own?  I reach out a trembling hand to touch the swirling vortex, and it feels surprisingly warm, almost alive.  A voice, soft as the rustle of silk, whispers in my ear, *“Not with understanding, but with feeling.”*

I close my eyes, breathing deeply, trying to connect with the emotions each landscape evokes. The vortex feels like exhilarating freedom, a leap of faith. The mountains, a sense of quiet strength and enduring perseverance. The ocean, a boundless expanse of potential and the bittersweet ache of longing.

Slowly, hesitantly, I begin to sketch.  Not detailed renderings, but small, expressive symbols.  A single, soaring bird for the vortex. A tiny, steadfast tree clinging to the mountainside.  A single, luminous tear falling into the ocean.

As I finish, the landscapes on the paper begin to shimmer, then fade.  The voice whispers again, this time clearer, *"Your answers are not in the landscapes, but in the reflections they sparked within you."*  A wave of calm washes over me, replacing the anxiety.  I feel a profound sense of peace, a knowing that whatever my future holds, I'm prepared.  I wake up.
