You start to walk faster, scanning the street signs, but they're written in a language that almost looks familiar—like English letters rearranged into words that hover just at the edge of meaning. "Crestholm Avenue." "Drey Passage." Names that sound like they should anchor you but don't.

You pull out your phone. The screen lights up beautifully, but when you try to dial or search, the numbers rearrange themselves before you can press them. You type the address and watch the letters drift like leaves on water.

A woman walks past carrying an inside-out umbrella, and you grab her shoulder—gently—and ask for directions. She turns, and her face is kind, familiar in the way strangers sometimes are in dreams, and she says, *"You already know where it is. You've been there before."*

Which makes no sense. Except—

Suddenly you do feel something. A pull. Like a thread tied loosely around your sternum, tugging left at the next intersection. You follow it.

The city begins to shift around you—not frightening, but *accommodating*, the way water parts. Buildings lean slightly to open the path. A child on a bicycle rides past and points left without you asking. A café door opens and a man inside raises his coffee cup toward a window, gesturing—*that way.*

You're running now, but effortlessly, the way you can only run in dreams, your feet barely touching the wet pavement. The meeting feels enormously important—life-alteringly so—though you can't remember what it's *about*. Only that someone is waiting. Someone who has been waiting patiently for a very long time.

You round a corner and there it is: a building made almost entirely of glass, and inside, through the luminous walls, you can see a long table with one empty chair.

Everyone at the table looks up at once.

You push through the door, and the room smells like woodsmoke and rain, and someone says, warmly, with tremendous relief—

*"There you are. We were just talking about you."*

You sit down. You have no idea what comes next. But you're exactly on time, and for a moment, that is the only thing in the world that is completely, perfectly true.
