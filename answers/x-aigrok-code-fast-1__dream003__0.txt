You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns etched into its surface—swirling glyphs that shimmer like liquid silver under the dim light of an endless dusk. The designs twist and reform as you watch, whispering secrets in a language your mind almost grasps but can't quite hold.

Suddenly, one symbol flares brighter: a keyhole overlaid with intersecting lines. Your fingers trace them instinctively, and the box warms beneath your touch. Without realizing it, you've formed the key with your thoughts— a glowing ethereal shape that slides into the lock. The mechanism clicks, and the lid creaks open to reveal... a mirror, reflecting not your face but an alternate self standing in a world where gravity bends at will. That self steps out, pulling you into a crystalline city floating above infinite skies. You soar between spires of glass, chasing echoes of laughter that sound like your own, until you awaken in your bed, the box gone—but a feather of iridescent light drifts from your hand like a forgotten memory.
