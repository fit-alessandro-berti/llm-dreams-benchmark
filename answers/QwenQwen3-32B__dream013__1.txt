...begin to sense the air growing colder, the walls narrowing as if the maze itself is breathing. The first puzzle you encounter is a towering stone door etched with a riddle in a language that shifts before your eyes. You realize it’s not a language at all—it’s a melody. Humming the tune (a haunting lullaby you somehow remember from childhood), you watch the door dissolve into a cascade of fireflies, revealing a corridor lined with mirrors.  

But the mirrors don’t reflect you. They show fragmented memories: a locked diary, a stranger’s smile, a key falling into water. You piece together that the next puzzle lies *between* the reflections, and when you press your palm to the glass, you’re pulled into a labyrinth of light and shadows. Here, shapes form a tangram-like puzzle in midair—a silhouette of a bird that demands precise alignment of floating geometric shards. Your hands tremble; misplacing a piece causes the shadows to lunge, scraping the walls and emitting a sound like rusted hinges. You solve it, and the bird takes flight, leading you to a chamber with a single word glowing on the floor: **"Breathe."**  

The air thickens. You notice your shadow has split into three, each performing different actions: one clutches a map, another points to a wall inscription, the third… is you, but older, with eyes like smoldering coals. The puzzle now is *time*. You must touch the wall inscription (a palindrome) *while* holding the map’s center *while* ignoring the older shadow’s whispers, which try to drown out your thoughts. Sweat blurs your vision, but you focus on the rhythm of your breath, syncing it to the palindrome’s syllables. The walls dissolve, and the maze ahead splits into four paths—but the ground beneath each is transparent, revealing endless voids below.  

A voice, neither kind nor cruel, says, **“Choose the question, not the answer.”** You realize the paths are labeled with questions: *Who are you? Why here? What’s lost? What’s next?* Choosing “What’s lost” causes the path to solidify, but the floor tiles now morph into sliding puzzle pieces. You solve it by recalling the diary, the key, the melody—every puzzle’s essence becomes a key. Finally, a door appears, but when you open it, you’re back at the start. Only now, the maze hums a new riddle: **“You carry the exit.”**  

You wake—*or do you?*—as the dream loops, the walls softening into the texture of your eyelids.
