...take a deep breath and step back, but as I do, the ground beneath us suddenly transforms into soft, rippling water. We're both standing on the surface somehow, and our angry words create visible ripples that spread outward in impossible colors - deep purples and electric greens.

My friend's face shifts between familiar and strange, and I realize I can't quite remember what we were arguing about, only that it felt urgent moments ago. The water around us begins to rise, forming translucent walls, and suddenly we're in a room made entirely of flowing water that somehow holds its shape.

\ to say, but instead of words, small paper boats emerge from my mouth, each one carrying a tiny glowing message. My friend starts laughing, and their laughter becomes a flock of origami birds that circle overhead. 

We both reach for the same paper boat floating between us, and when our hands touch, the entire water-room shatters into a thousand mirrors, each reflecting a different moment of our friendship - some I remember, others that feel like they're from alternate timelines.

Then I'm falling backwards through my own reflection, and I wake up with the strange sensation that the argument was both resolved and never happened at all.
