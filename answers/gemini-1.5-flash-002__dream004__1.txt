...and a single, impossibly sharp silver pencil.  The canvas itself shimmers, its edges blurring and reforming into different geometric patterns – a moment a perfect circle, the next a jagged, impossible triangle.  The pencil, however, remains constant, a solid point of reality in this kaleidoscopic chaos.  An urge, almost a compulsion, overwhelms me. I have to draw.

But what to draw?  The colors around me swirl – a violent fuchsia bleeds into a calming turquoise, then explodes into a shower of electric orange. Shapes twist and contort – a sine wave morphs into a spiral, then a fractal pattern unfolds endlessly.  I try to capture the feeling, the energy, but my initial strokes are hesitant.  Each line I draw on the shifting canvas immediately alters, bending and warping according to the canvas’s own chaotic rhythm.  A straight line becomes a sine wave, a circle a distorted ellipse.

Frustration mounts, then gives way to a strange acceptance. I stop trying to *control* the drawing and instead let the canvas guide my hand.  I begin to scribble, letting the pencil dance across the surface, responding to the ever-changing colors and shapes.  The act of drawing becomes a dialogue, a collaboration with the surreal landscape.  The canvas becomes a mirror, reflecting not my intent, but the essence of the shifting world itself. The final result isn't a picture, not in any traditional sense. It's a chaotic, vibrant tapestry of color and form, constantly in flux, a perfect representation of the dream itself.  As I step back, the canvas pulses with a soft light, and then, the dream fades.
