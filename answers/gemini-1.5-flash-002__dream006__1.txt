…begin to realize the podium isn't a podium at all, but a giant, iridescent seashell.  It hums faintly, a low, resonant thrum that vibrates through my bare feet. The expectant faces in the crowd are no longer human, but a kaleidoscope of shimmering fish, their scales catching the light like a thousand tiny jewels.  My prepared speech, meticulously crafted and practiced, dissolves into swirling seaweed in my mind.

Instead of words, a melody wells up inside me, a strange, haunting tune that feels both ancient and utterly new. I raise my hands, not to hold a microphone, but to conduct this inner orchestra.  The seashell amplifies the music, filling the vast auditorium with a tide of sound – a symphony of shimmering scales, clicking claws, and the deep, resonant sigh of the ocean.  The fish-faces sway and ripple in time with the music, their eyes reflecting the shifting colours of the melody.  I’m no longer giving a speech; I’m leading a choir of the deep, a conductor of oceanic dreams.  The music swells, reaching a crescendo of breathtaking beauty, then slowly fades, leaving a silence punctuated only by the gentle hum of the giant seashell and the contented shimmering of the underwater audience.  I bow, a silent curtsy to my unseen, finned congregation, and wake with the lingering echo of the ocean in my ears.
