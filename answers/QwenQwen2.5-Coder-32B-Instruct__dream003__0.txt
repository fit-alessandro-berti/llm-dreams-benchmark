As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and symbols etched into the wood of the box. The symbols seem to form a word in a language you don't recognize. Suddenly, you remember a clue given to you earlier by a mysterious old woman at a dusty bookstore downtown. She had- in a voice barely more than a whisper and with eyes that looked straight through you- mentioned that you'll need to unlock the secret to the box using the language of the ancients. 

Your heart races as you realize she might actually mean something that truly ancient. Turning the box around, you spot what seems like an old engraving of a map of the world, and something you earlier dismissed as a scratch - actually appears to be a symbol for an archaic language. With trembling hands, you attempt to trace these markings that now seem like the key to the box.

Recalling what she had said about the language of the ancients, you try to remember the chanting, the incantations that the woman had spoken among the shadows of the bookshelf filled with ancient tomes. You start out slowly, the unfamiliar language tripping your tongue, but gradually, the wording becomes clearer to your mind.

Then, you notice a unusual glow emanating from the map embedded within the box. The glow grows stronger and from the lock, intricate geometrical shapes begin to float upwards until they fuse together and move over to the wood of the box. As the symbols hover over the box, they take on new shapes and begin to reflect the light around them creating a mesmerizing visual of an ancient world that tells of an era of magic and wonder. The symbols start to spin, and the box begins to vibrate, causing the uneasy feeling that the box is about to open on its own accord.
  
The woman's voice echoes in your mind, warning you of what's inside the box and the secrets that lie within. As the symbols finally settle into place, the lock clicks open with a final burst of light, leaving you standing before the box with an overwhelming sense of anticipation. And in one swift motion, you open it, revealing its contents.
