You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and **each one feels like a different country, speaking a language you almost remember.**

First, a cluster near the grand piano where laughter is too sharp and bright, like breaking glass. Their conversations are about niche artisanal cheeses and the ethics of blockchain, and when you try to edge closer, their sentences fold in on themselves, becoming silent, smiling circles. You back away.

Then, a dim library nook where people are whispering about the *architecture of the dream*. One looks up and says, “The house is breathing, can’t you feel it?” The bookshelves seem to ripple. You hurry past.

The kitchen is a humid jungle of steam and clatter. A woman hands you a glass of something fizzing and violet. “You’re looking for the anchor?” she asks, her eyes reflecting the bubbling liquid. “They always are. Drink this, it helps you see the seams.” You decline, and the crowd parts like a curtain, revealing a hallway you’re sure wasn’t there before.

Down the hallway, the music swells into a waltz. A ballroom of people dancing flawlessly, but their faces are all turned toward the empty center. You see a familiar sweater—your friend’s—on a distant wall hook, but when you approach, it’s just a decorative tapestry depicting that same sweater. A dancer glides past and murmurs, “They’re in the room where the clocks have stopped. But be careful: the person you find there may only be the idea of them.”

You find a corridor of doors. Most are locked, but one is ajar, revealing not a room, but a reflection. The other side of a mirror. Inside the mirror, the party continues, but everyone is facing *you*. And there, at the center, standing with their back to you… is your friend. You reach out to touch the glass, and it’s not cold, but soft, like velvet.

You step through.

You’re now on the other side. The party is silent. All faces are turned to you. The person you came for is before you, but they won’t turn around. As you place a hand on their shoulder, they finally slowly pivot.

Their face is your own, but tired, and smiling sadly. “Took you long enough,” they say. “I’ve been waiting in the version where you never showed up.”

You awake, heart pounding, the echo of their whisper still in the air: *“Now who is going to look for you?”*
