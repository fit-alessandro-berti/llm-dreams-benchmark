...you encounter various groups of people and each one is stranger than the last.

There's a cluster of figures draped in velvet, their faces obscured by intricate masks woven from spider silk, who are engaged in a hushed, intense debate about the proper temperature for brewing silence. They don't seem to notice you, their voices like dry leaves skittering across a floor.

You move past them and find another group, all dressed in various shades of green, standing perfectly still as if posing for an invisible portrait. One turns their head, their eyes reflecting the light like polished stones, and offers you a small, smooth pebble that feels strangely warm in your hand. They say nothing, simply gesture vaguely towards a doorway that wasn't there a moment ago.

Hesitantly, you step towards the new doorway. It leads not to another room, but to a small, moonlit garden where fish swim through the air like birds among trees that hum with a low, electrical current. In the center of the garden, a single person sits playing a violin made of glass. The melody is achingly familiar, almost like the laugh of the person you're trying to find, but it trails off into a series of mathematical equations.

You try to ask the violinist if they've seen your friend, but your voice comes out as a shower of tiny, shimmering bells. The violinist smiles, a slow, knowing smile, and points back towards the way you came.

Returning to the party, the rooms have rearranged themselves. The music is now a collection of whispers echoing from the walls. You see a shape that *must* be your friend across the impossibly vast dance floor, a flash of their hair, the way they hold their head. You push through the crowd, which now consists of people with faces that constantly shift and blur, like reflections in disturbed water. Just as you get close, the shape resolves into a stranger holding a single, wilting flower, looking at you with an expression of deep, ancient sadness.

A sense of mild panic, layered with a strange, detached curiosity, washes over you. You look down at your hands and realize you are wearing gloves made of light. The pebble from the green-clad person has turned into a tiny, ticking clock, showing a time that doesn't exist. You still need to find your friend, but the reason why feels less urgent, less clear. Perhaps the person you were looking for was never really here, or perhaps they were one of the faces that just blurred past you in the crowd, or maybe... maybe they were the one holding the glass violin, playing the sound of a familiar laugh in a garden where fish fly. You take a breath, and the air tastes like cinnamon and distant thunder. The search continues, not for your friend anymore, but for the next strange encounter, just around the corner that wasn't there a second ago.
