Okay, I'm dreaming...

...The air in the vast hall is thick with the low hum of conversation, a thousand voices blending into an indistinct murmur. Chandeliers hang impossibly high, their light hazy and fractured, casting long, watery shadows. I'm standing at the edge of the crowd, a strange mix of ornate furniture and abstract shapes blurring the distinction between architecture and art. My chest feels tight with the singular goal: find *them*. The one familiar face in this sea of strangers.

I step forward, navigating the edges. I pass a group gathered around a table that seems to be made of liquid light. They are playing a game with invisible pieces, their faces contorted in expressions of intense concentration, yet their eyes seem to look through me, or past me entirely. One of them sighs, and the liquid table ripples, sending a jolt of cool air through my skin.

Further on, I encounter a cluster of people all wearing hats that whisper. Not *make* whispering sounds, but the hats themselves *are* whispers, woven from faint, fleeting phrases I almost understand – names I've forgotten, promises unkept, snippets of songs. They stand very still, listening to their headwear. I try to ask if they've seen my person, but when I open my mouth, only a puff of colored smoke comes out.

I move deeper into the room, the floor occasionally feeling like sand, then smooth glass, then something soft like moss. I see a group laughing, but their laughter makes no sound. Their bodies convulse silently, tears streaming upwards from their eyes to pool on the ceiling. It's unsettlingly joyous and sorrowful at the same time.

Near a wall that seems to breathe, rippling like fabric, I see another group. They are meticulously arranging pebbles into intricate patterns on the floor. As I watch, the pebbles begin to glow, then lift into the air, forming miniature, shimmering constellations that drift away towards the ceiling. One of the pebble-arrangers glances at me; their face is blank, but in their eyes, I see a reflection of a place I've never been but feel I should recognize.

Panic starts to bubble slightly. Where are they? The crowd feels like it's getting denser, shifting like schools of fish. I push through figures draped in shimmering cloaks that leave trails of stardust, past people whose faces seem to constantly rearrange themselves like shifting sand. The air grows heavier, smelling faintly of rain and forgotten birthdays. I call out my person's name, but the sound seems to get swallowed by the general hum.

Then, across the room, near a window that looks out onto an impossible purple sky, I see a figure. They are silhouetted against the strange light, but I *know* it's them. Relief floods through me, so potent it makes my knees weak. I start to move towards them, urgency propelling me forward. The distance seems vast, impossibly vast. I push harder through the throng, bumping into people who feel like empty suits of clothes, who whisper directions that make no sense ("Go left, towards the sound of the color yellow!").

As I finally get closer, the figure turns. My heart leaps. But as they fully face me, I see... it's not them. Or maybe it is, but their face is subtly wrong, like a portrait painted from memory by someone who only half-knew the subject. They smile, a wide, slow smile that doesn't reach their eyes, which are the same blank, starry eyes as the pebble-arranger. They lift a hand, not in greeting, but pointing past me, towards a doorway that wasn't there a moment ago, framed by glowing, thorny vines.

The figure's smile widens, and they step back into the shadows near the purple window. The murmur of the crowd suddenly intensifies, rushing towards me like a wave, and the lights of the chandeliers dim, then flicker out, leaving only the faint, pulsing glow from the impossible doorway and the distant, impossible sky. The music, which I hadn't realized was playing, shifts into a deep, resonant thrumming that vibrates in my bones... and I feel myself being pulled, not towards the figure, but irresistibly towards the thorny, glowing door, leaving the dissolving crowd behind...
