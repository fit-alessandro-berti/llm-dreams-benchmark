…begin to sense that the labyrinth is not just stone and hedge but something sentient, shifting in response to the patterns of your mind. A set of tiles you just arranged to form a prime-number sequence reconfigures itself into the date of your first day of school. A riddle whispered through the walls repeats a phrase your grandmother used to say.

The deeper you go, the corridors narrow and widen unnaturally. Gravity occasionally tilts; sometimes you must solve an equation upside down while holding onto a railing that wasn't there a heartbeat before. Logic morphs into metaphor. A door refuses to open until you forgive someone. A lock insists on being opened by a lullaby you haven't sung since you were a child.

There is a moment when you pause, forehead damp, palms stinging from cold stone. You realise that although you've been applying rules and reason, the puzzles are no longer interested in the right answer but in the way you arrive at it. The walls hum with your frustration, then calm as your breathing slows. You laugh, and the laughter echoes, and a hidden panel slides aside.

At the center, after an impossible staircase and a hallway lined with mirrors that do not reflect you, you come to a room empty except for a single table. On it sits a plain wooden box with no obvious seams or lock. Written on the lid in a hand you recognise as your own are the words, "What is the way out?"

You sit. There is no key. There is no trick. In that suspended silence you remember that you are dreaming. You close your eyes, not to see but to let go, and the box clicks open as if acknowledging the answer.

Light pours out, warm and familiar. The maze dissolves. You wake to your own ceiling, the aftertaste of riddles fading, the sense of having solved something you can’t quite name still lingering at the edges of your mind.
