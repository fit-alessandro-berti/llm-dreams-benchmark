You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to blend in fast—or risk being burned as a witch.

The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth, and the cobblestone street beneath your feet is slick with morning mist. Horse-drawn carts rumble past, piled high with turnips and wool, while villagers in roughspun tunics haggle in a language that's almost English but twisted with archaic flourishes—"Good morrow, goodwife!" shouts a baker with a face like weathered bark. Your jeans and sneakers scream "outsider," and already, a cluster of wide-eyed children points at you, whispering "Stranger from the faerie rings!"

Panic surges as you spot a hooded figure in the town square—a priest or inquisitor?—eyeing you with suspicion. No phone, no wallet, no ID. Your only assets: wits, a vague memory of history books, and the dream-logic that this might not be forever.

You duck into an alley, heart pounding, and rummage your pockets: a single coin from your "real" life (useless here) and a half-eaten protein bar (definitely witchcraft fodder). Time to improvise. You spot a laundry line strung with homespun dresses and snag one, swapping it for your modern garb behind a barrel. It itches like hell, but now you look the part.

Emerging, you approach a kindly-looking old woman selling herbs. "Prithee, dame," you say, channeling every Shakespeare play you half-remember, "whence comes this realm? I am... lost from my kin."

She squints, then chuckles. "From the New World, eh? Or beyond the veil? Come, child—work my stall for bread and a tale."

As the day unfolds, you learn it's 1587, England under Good Queen Bess, and whispers of Spanish invaders fill the air. But deeper in the dream, things warp: the moon hangs too close, shadows whisper secrets, and your reflection in a puddle shows eyes that glow faintly.

By nightfall, as you huddle in a hayloft, you realize the true need: not just survival, but a way to wake up. Rub your hands together? Pinch yourself? Or chase the glowing fox that's been trailing you since dawn...

*Suddenly, the hayloft dissolves into pixels, and you're tumbling back toward familiarity—your alarm blaring. But was it really a dream? Your hand smells like herbs.*
