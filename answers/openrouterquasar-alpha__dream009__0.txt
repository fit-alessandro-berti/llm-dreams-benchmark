You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to rely on your instincts and resourcefulness. The air smells of earth and woodsmoke, and villagers dressed in simple homespun clothing pass by, glancing at you with curiosity. 

Your first priority is to find water and shelter, so you walk toward the sound of a nearby stream glistening under the morning sun. As you cup your hands to drink the cool water, you notice your reflection—your clothes stand out strangely against the handmade garments of the locals.

Determined to blend in and learn about this unfamiliar time, you follow the path leading into the village. Perhaps there you can find someone kind enough to answer your questions—or at the very least, a place to rest and gather your thoughts.

Every detail feels vivid and alive. Though the world is unfamiliar, a strange excitement stirs within you. You realize this dream is an opportunity to discover who you can be without the trappings of your old life—and what secrets this bygone era might reveal.
