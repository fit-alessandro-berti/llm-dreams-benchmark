*settling into the dream*

...feel a wash of relief so profound it almost brings tears to my eyes. Their faces are indistinct but warm—the way faces are in dreams—shifting between strangers and people I almost recognize.

They begin walking with me through streets that keep rearranging themselves. A woman with silver hair points down an alley that opens into a sunlit courtyard I'm certain wasn't there before. A child takes my hand, and their grip feels like remembering something important I'd forgotten.

We pass a café where everyone is reading the same book, but the title changes each time I try to read it. One of my guides laughs—not at me, but like they understand something I don't yet.

Then I realize I never told them where I was going. When I ask, they exchange glances and the silver-haired woman says, *\'t lost in a place. You were lost in a feeling.\ city starts to soften at its edges. The strangers begin to fade, but not in a frightening way—more like dawn erasing stars. Before they disappear entirely, one of them turns back and says:

*\ can find us again. We're wherever you let yourself be helped.\, carrying something that feels like the ghost of a hand in mine.
