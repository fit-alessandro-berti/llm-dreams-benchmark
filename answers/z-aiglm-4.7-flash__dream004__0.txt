...and yet, it feels heavy with potential, hanging suspended in a sky that flickers between ultramarine and bruised violet. Instead of wood or stretchers, the surface seems to be woven from the very air of the dream itself, rippling with a faint, pulsing geometric grid.

You reach out to touch it, but your fingers pass through the ether, leaving trails of iridescent dust. Suddenly, the geometric grid ripples like water, and the shapes of the world—the jagged mountains, the spiraling nebulae, the leviathans swimming in the foam—begin to pour onto the surface. There is no paintbrush, only your intent. With a thought, the chaotic geometry resolves itself into something intimately personal: a map of the memories you haven't yet had.

As the canvas fills, it begins to expand, slowly swallowing the entire universe until it is the only thing left.
