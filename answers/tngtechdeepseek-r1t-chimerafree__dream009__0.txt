You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to decipher the cryptic symbols etched into a weathered stone tablet—a map leading to a forgotten city rumored to hold the key to returning home.

The dream lingers there, suspended between curiosity and dread, as you clutch the tablet and wonder—do you follow the path, or run?
