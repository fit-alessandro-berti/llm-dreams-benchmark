as you reach out to touch it, the canvas ripples like water. Suddenly, colors from the shifting world around you begin to swirl and flow onto its surface, painting themselves into forms you don’t quite recognize—yet they feel strangely familiar. 

You take a step closer, and the shapes begin to move. A door appears in the center of the canvas, flickering between different materials—wood, glass, stone, even pure light. You feel an irresistible urge to step through.

As you do, the air around you hums with energy, and you emerge into a new space—an infinite sky filled with floating islands, each carrying fragments of forgotten memories. Some are yours, some are not. A golden bridge connects the nearest island to where you stand, but with every step you take, the bridge transforms beneath your feet—sometimes solid, sometimes translucent, sometimes nothing but light.

Then, you notice something peculiar: shadows moving on the edges of your vision. They seem to be watching you, waiting. Not with malice, but with expectation. One shadow extends a hand, offering you an object—a key that pulses with the same ever-changing colors of the world you left behind.

What will you do?
