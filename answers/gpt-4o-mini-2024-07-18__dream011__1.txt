completely blank. You flip through the pages in a panic, hoping to find at least one question, but every page is empty. The clock on the wall ticks loudly, echoing in your ears as sweat begins to bead on your forehead. Other students around you are scribbling furiously, their papers filled with dense text and diagrams. You glance over at your friend, who looks calm and collected, and you wish you knew what they were writing.

Suddenly, the room starts to shift and warp, the walls bending inward and the ceiling rising higher. Bright colors flood your vision, and you feel a strange pull in your stomach as reality begins to dissolve. The exam papers transform into swirling clouds of color and energy, and the classroom fades away.

You find yourself standing in a vast, open field under a sky that shifts from blue to pink to deep purple. In the distance, a figure emerges, waving enthusiastically. As they come closer, you recognize them as your favorite professor, but they look different, dressed in flowing robes and wearing glasses that seem to reflect the stars.

“Welcome to the realm of potential!” they exclaim, gesturing to the field around you. “Here, you can visualize your future career. What do you want to become?”

You feel a rush of excitement and anxiety, and the grass beneath your feet starts to ripple like water. Images begin to form around you—pictures of different careers, workplaces, and opportunities that whisper possibilities in your ears. 

“Choose wisely,” your professor says, smiling knowingly. With a deep breath, you step forward, feeling a pull towards a shimmering light in the distance that looks like a vibrant city filled with innovative buildings and bustling creativity. You take a step towards it, your heart racing, and the world around you shifts once more—into a cityscape where your dreams could finally take form.

But just as you’re about to step into the light, a loud siren blares, and the dream shakes violently. The colors twist, and you hear the frantic ticking of the exam clock again. You look around in confusion, realizing that you’re still in the exam room but the professor and the field have disappeared. The empty pages now have a single question: “What do you truly wish to pursue?”

You start to write, pouring your heart onto the page, realizing that the answer lies not within the exam itself but within you. Time begins to blur as you feel clarity wash over you in waves. The ticking of the clock fades into the background, and for the first time, you feel an undeniable sense of freedom.
