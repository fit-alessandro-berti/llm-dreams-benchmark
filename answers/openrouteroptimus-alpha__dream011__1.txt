...written in a script you've never seen before—symbols that shift and blur with each glance. The room feels both too large and too small, the ceiling lost in fog, the walls pulsing with soft, indistinct music. You flip through the pages in search of anything familiar, and on the last page, you find a single sentence you can read:

*"Describe the sound of your footsteps as you walk toward your dreams."*

You reach for your pen, but instead your hand brushes the soft feathers of a bird perched on your desk, watching you with knowing eyes. The bird cocks its head, as if waiting for your answer. The exam clock melts across the wall and you realize, all at once, that time here obeys no rules.

Your footsteps would echo on unfamiliar ground, you think. Sometimes a skip, sometimes a stumble. You begin to write, noticing that as your words flow, the symbols on the other pages slowly resolve into memories—each question now a story you've lived, not a problem to solve.

When you finish, the bird gently takes your test with its beak and flies up into the fog above. The music swells, the walls and floor dissolve, and the door ahead opens into sunlight.
