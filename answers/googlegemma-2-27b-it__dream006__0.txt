...feel a prickle of warmth spread across my nonexistent skin. The sense of a crowd's anticipation prickled the hairs on the back of my neck, an curious sensation for a dream self. I took a deep breath, the air tingling with a strange, static electricity, and surveyed the audience.

Instead of faces, the crowd was a swirling mass of vibrant colors. They shimmered and pulsed, a wave of shimmering blue and gold, reflecting the flashing stage lights. The warmth intensified, twisting into warmth tinged by fear as my artificial courage wavered. I, a figment of my subconscious, took a step back, suddenly aware that words felt glued to the back of my throat. 

A jolt of panic ran through me as I saw the expectant crowd morphing again. 

This time their shimmering forms,  faces now gone, turned into swirling galaxies. The nebulae of their attempts to resemble faces were becoming barely perceptible, flickering in and out of existence alongside billions of years of unspoken memories and anxieties swirling in the audience's swirling depths. 

A gasp rippled through the assembled stars and planets (or so my dream self perceived, my heart racing a frantic rhythm even though I had no heart).

**Then I begin to...** 

...improvise.

My fear melted away as the immensity of the universe absorbed them, the rush of my initial panic replaced by a strange calm. My dream-body, no longer burdened by the weight of the imaginary stares, remembered why it was on stage: the cheers, the applause, the roar of the crowd. But the faces, the anxieties - they were gone.

My fear was replaced with a bizarrely fascinating mix of excitement and dread. There were no faces, no, just a cascade of twinkling lights, a kaleidoscope of emotions swirling before me. The air around the audience felt...heavy. But now, instead of simply a lack of clear faces, I felt something more.

A billion eyes were gazing at me, hungry and churning with the endless hopeful anxiety of humans looking at their own reflections. The audience was the nebula, faces changing and shifting, a swirling kaleidoscope of much-too-bright smiles and concerned frowns, reminding me they were all afraid of blankness, of the vastness and indifference of cosmos, fading into each other like whispers of a forgotten dream.

I had no idea what I was supposed to say, this anxiety beginning to dissolve the galaxies, blurring their outlines. My audience kept morphing, sometimes into a single, amorphous blob of emotions, a swirling entity of awe and inspiration, seeing the potential of my life, the beautiful hands of the fabric of reality I was crafting. A strange, silent emotion washes through me as a whirlwind of anxieties, hopes, and dreams rush into my mind. Was I ready for this evolution, I felt the audience asking me. What would their (my?) choices hold for my future? What would I do with this opportunity? The questions remained, a silent storm of doubt and fear swirling around me.

I froze on stage, unsure of what the stage light represented, knowing I wouldn't be released just by joining their (my?) murmuring. Suddenly, the lights escalate into brilliant, blinding bursts,

but also doubts.

It was overwhelming, a wall of questions mounting with every diminishing galaxy. Was this what they wanted?

I realized I was trapped.
