…step outside into a cool, misty twilight to clear your heads. The argument echoes in your mind—voices raised but trembling with the weight of history and affection. Your friend follows you silently, each footstep softened by dew-soaked grass. For a while, you walk in parallel, the air thick with things unsaid.

You pause beneath a familiar old tree, its branches twisting like thoughts, and finally turn to face your friend. The tension between you is almost tangible, but in the soft light, you see something fragile in their eyes—regret, hope, fear.

You take a breath. The dream landscape hums gently, as if waiting with you, and you say, “I just want to understand. Help me see it your way.” Your friend’s posture softens. Unexpectedly, your surroundings begin to blur, the scenery shifting in dream logic—suddenly you’re both seated beside a stream you used to visit as children.

Memories flood your mind—shared laughter, secrets whispered, the easy trust of years before. The argument’s urgency fades, replaced by the realization that what binds you is deeper than what divides you.

Your friend reaches over, squeezing your hand. The feeling is realer than anything else.

“We’ll figure it out,” they say softly, and as the water flows past, you feel yourself waking, forgiveness and understanding seeping into your heart like sunlight through dawn mist.
