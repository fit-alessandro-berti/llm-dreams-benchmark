…speak, except the first sound that comes out of your mouth is not your voice.

It’s a sound like a match being struck in a cavern.

The microphone trembles in your hand and blooms into a white lily, cold and luminous. The cord snakes away across the stage like a black river, disappearing between the front row seats. No one reacts. Hundreds of faces wait, breath held, eyes bright, as if this is exactly what they came for.

You clear your throat to try again, but this time the words emerge as a small flock of paper birds. They flutter out, each printed with a sentence you’re sure you meant to say, but in a language you don’t recognize. The birds wheel toward the ceiling, where there is no ceiling anymore, only a sky the color of deep water. They vanish into it.

A hush deepens.

“I—”

The letter I leaves your tongue, solid and literal, about the height of a chair. It lands on the stage with a soft, rubbery bounce. You both stare at it—yourself and the crowd. The uppercase I looks embarrassed. You feel embarrassed for it.

In the third row, a woman in a red coat raises her hand.

“Excuse me,” she says, politely. “You dropped your self.”

Polite laughter ripples across the auditorium, though no one’s lips move.

You bend to pick the I up, but the stage surface slicks into water. The letter floats, then elongates into your own arm, reaching back up at you from the floor as if you are the rescue and the drowning simultaneously. A bit dizzy, you straighten, and the water goes flat-black and reflective, and now you can see the audience upside down, looking far more real in the reflection than in the seats.

“I’m sorry,” you tell them, or you think you do, but it issues as a bright red balloon that says SORRY in looping script. It ascends, then hits an invisible limit and smears across it like wet paint, the letters dripping down in long thin threads.

No one is disturbed. They lean forward, intent.

You are suddenly aware you have notes. You don’t remember bringing them, but they’re there, heavy in your hands: a stack of pages bound with a spine made of vertebrae that look suspiciously like your own. When you glance down, the text rearranges itself.

PAGE 1:
Say what you are afraid to say.

You look up. Every person in the crowd now has your face. Hundreds of you, all waiting, all knowing when you lie.

You feel the old terror: that nothing you can say will be enough, that everything you can say will be too much.

You decide to speak anyway.

“I am—”

This time the words come as sound, but they trail streamers of light, hanging in the air, visible. I am so tired of performing. I am afraid I am only real in your eyes. I am afraid I am hollow without your applause. I don’t know what I’m doing. Please don’t leave. Please don’t look too closely. Please look closer.

None of those are what your mouth is trying to say, but they pour out, huge and gentle, and the audience of your-faces reads them in the air.

Some of them smile with a tenderness you have never given yourself. Some look worried. One of you in the front row stands up and says, “There it is.”

The stage shudders, sheds its boards, grows roots. You’re standing barefoot on soil. The podium has turned into a doorframe with no door. Beyond it is not backstage—there is no backstage—but a twilight field and a small, steady house lit from within.

You glance at the crowd. “I’m not ready,” you confess.

The admission floats like glass, then softens, falls as warm rain on their upturned faces. They close their eyes, letting it soak in.

“You never are,” says a version of you in the back. “We came to see you anyway.”

You realize the dream has mistaken who is on display. It is not you for them; it is all of you for each other. The speech is not a performance; it’s a bridge.

So you inhale.

On this breath, your lungs fill with cold night air and the smell of wet earth and stage dust and lilies and paper and ink. When you exhale, your voice arrives—your actual voice, the one you use when no one is listening.

You begin to speak:

“I thought I had to earn being here. I thought I needed to be smaller to be acceptable, or larger to be impressive. I thought I had to be finished to be seen. But you are all just versions of me hoping I’ll stand up here and tell the truth so we can go home.”

The words don’t turn into birds or balloons. They stay words, thick with reality, and roll out across the hall. Wherever they touch, the duplicate faces dissolve into themselves: strangers, friends, teachers, people from childhood, people you’ve never met but somehow love. They blink, no longer perfect or expectant—just human.

Behind you, the empty doorframe brightens. You feel the tug to step through.

“Is this the end?” you ask.

A child’s voice from the front row—your voice, younger—answers, “It’s the part where you stop dreaming you’re alone.”

You look down once more at your notes. Every page is blank now except the last.

PAGE ∞:
Say thank you. Then wake up.

You turn back to the crowd, suddenly shy, suddenly proud of still being here despite everything.

“Thank you for coming,” you say.

And all at once they stand and applaud—not loud, not ferocious, but like rain on leaves, endless and kind—as the bright field beyond the doorframe folds upward like a curtain, and the clapping becomes your alarm, and the stage-light becomes morning spilling through your real window.

You open your eyes with the echo of your own voice still in your mouth, remembering, for a flicker, that you are allowed to step onto every day the way you stepped onto that stage:

Unfinished.
Afraid.
And still speaking.
