…a brush floats toward you, humming with a soft, golden light. Its handle is carved from polished birch, and its bristles shimmer like captured starlight—every strand a different hue, shifting from cerulean to violet to molten copper as it hovers inches from the canvas.

The canvas itself isn’t blank for long.

As your fingers brush the brush’s handle, the surface *breathes*. A ripple spreads outward, and tiny, glowing fractals bloom where you touch—a dandelion clock unfurling in slow motion, its seeds each a tiny spiral of silver and moss-green light. The air smells of ozone and crushed mint.

A voice, not quite sound but more like warmth spreading through your bones, whispers:  
*“What do you need to see?”*

Suddenly, you realize—this isn’t a canvas to paint *on*. It’s a canvas to paint *with*. And the paint isn’t pigment. It’s *memory*.

Beside you, shapes coalesce:  
- A carousel horse made of stained glass, its colors bleeding into each other like watercolors on wet paper.  
- A door made of folded origami cranes, wings fluttering in a wind only you can feel.  
- A staircase spiraling upward into a sky of liquid mercury, reflecting not clouds, but fragments of conversations half-remembered.

You lift the brush—not to apply color, but to *gather* it. With a gentle sweep, you collect the scent of rain on warm pavement, the taste of stolen strawberries at dusk, the sound of your mother’s laugh echoing from a summer porch years ago. Each memory drips onto the canvas not as image, but as * resonance*: a chord of amber light, a pulse of indigo vibration, a swirl of honey-gold texture that hums against your fingertips.

The canvas begins to glow—not with its own light, but with *your* past, now rearranged. The carousel horse gallops across the lower corner, its hooves leaving trails of fireflies. The origami door opens—not outward, but inward—revealing a room filled with soft, floating origami birds that whisper forgotten promises.

Then, the dream shifts.

A figure approaches: tall, slender, woven from intersecting shadows and light—like a stained-glass window viewed at twilight. Their face is soft, indistinct, yet kind. They hold a second brush, this one made of spun moonlight.

“You’re not painting *your* story,” they say, their voice like wind chimes in a slow breeze. “You’re painting *the possibility* of it. Every choice, every memory, every dream… it doesn’t just *happen*. It *blooms*.”

They extend the moonlight brush toward the canvas—and where it touches, new threads appear: silvery filaments connecting the carousel to the door, the staircase to the ocean of mercury. They’re not pictures. They’re *branches*. Paths not taken. Futures not written.

One branch glows especially bright.  
It leads to a garden of living origami—birds, lotus blossoms, paper lanterns—all unfolding slowly, each petal or feather revealing a tiny scene: a child catching fireflies, two hands clasping in greeting, a single raindrop hanging suspended in midair, refracting a thousand sunsets.

The voice whispers again, softer now:  
*“You get to choose which branch you water. Not just in dreams… but when you wake.”*

The canvas shivers.  
The colors deepen.  
And the question lingers—warm, urgent, tender—like a half-remembered promise:  
*Which memory will you paint first?*  

*(The dream holds its breath, waiting for your answer.)*
