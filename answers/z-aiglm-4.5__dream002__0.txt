The wind picks *up* suddenly, whipping the leaves into a frenzy. The air crackles with ozone, thick and heavy. You look up as the peaceful sky above vanishes, swallowed by churning, bruise-purple clouds that boil unnaturally fast. Sunlight flees, replaced by an eerie, pre-storm gloom. A low rumble vibrates through the ground beneath your bare feet, growing into a deafening roar that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere. **Rain begins to fall – not drops, but thick, warm globules that land like tears, smelling faintly of iron and damp earth.**

You start running, the path dissolving under your feet into slick, sucking mud. Trees twist into grotesque, grasping shapes in the dimness. The wind voices aren't just wind anymore; they become a cacophony of whispers, shouts, and animal cries, layered and overwhelming. **Lightning forks not downwards, but *sideways*, illuminating the forest in stark, momentary blinding flashes that reveal impossible things: eyes glowing in the hollows of trees, shadows detaching from the ground to scuttle alongside you, the bark of oaks rippling like water.**

A deafening CRACK splits the air, not thunder, but the sound of a massive ancient tree snapping like a twig. It crashes down mere feet ahead, flames erupting spontaneously along its length, burning with an eerie green fire that casts dancing, warped shadows. You stumble back, heart hammering against your ribs like a trapped bird. The rain intensifies, now driving in horizontal sheets that sting your skin, the warm globules turning cold and sharp.

You turn to flee another way and freeze. Before you, the storm has torn a hole *through* the forest. Beyond the thrashing trees, you see not more woods, but an impossible vista: **a vast, churning ocean under a sky of shattered, multi-colored lightning, impossibly close.** Giant, translucent jellyfish pulse through the air like living lanterns, trailing light. The ground beneath you trembles violently, and you realize the edge of the land is crumbling away into the frothing, luminous sea below.

The wind grabs you, pulling you towards the edge. Panic surges, but then, **as the green fire from the fallen tree flickers across the waves, you see something reflected in the churning water: not your own frightened face, but a figure standing calmly on the cliff edge beside you, radiating a soft, internal light.** It turns its head, and though its features are indistinct, a profound sense of calm washes over you, cutting through the storm's chaos like a knife. The whispers soften into a single, clear thought: "**It is only wind.**"

You look back at the figure, but it's gone. The storm still rages, the lightning still flashes, the edge still crumbles... but the paralyzing fear has vanished. Replaced by a strange, exhilarating certainty. You take a deep breath of the electric air, step *forward* onto the crumbling earth, and leap **not into the churning sea below, but upwards**, arms outstretched. Instead of falling, you lift, caught in a sudden, powerful updraft. The wind becomes a solid thing beneath you, carrying you up, up, through the chaotic layers of the storm, past the floating jellyfish, towards the eye of the maelstrom where a single, impossibly bright star pulses, silent and serene. The forest shrinks below, the storm roaring now like a lullaby, as you ascend into the quiet, waiting light.
