panic, but then you calm yourself and decide to ask for help. You approach a passerby and explain your situation, only to discover they speak a language you've never heard before. Undeterred, you pull out your phone, hoping Google Translate will save the day, but the screen flickers and goes blank. You frantically search for a Wi-Fi connection, only to realize you're completely offline. Just when you're about to resign to missing the meeting, you notice a curious figure in the distance—a woman with a top hat and a map in hand. She gestures for you to follow, and without hesitation, you do.

The further you walk, the more surreal the city becomes. Streets twist and turn like a labyrinth, and the architecture shifts from towering skyscrapers to whimsical gingerbread houses. People move in slow motion around you, almost as if they’re part of a dream within a dream. The woman leads you to a small, hidden alley where a glowing portal emerges. Hesitantly, you step inside, and suddenly, you're transported to a serene garden.

In the center of the garden stands a grand clock tower, its hands frozen at the time of your meeting. A mysterious voice echoes in your mind, "The meeting is wherever you make it." With a newfound sense of clarity, you close your eyes, take a deep breath, and suddenly, you're standing in a familiar conference room, your phone buzzing with directions. The dream fades, and you wake up smiling, grateful for the strange journey that prepared you for the day ahead.
