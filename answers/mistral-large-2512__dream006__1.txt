The stage lights blur into a soft, golden haze as you take a deep breath, the weight of the moment pressing against your chest like a warm, familiar hand. The audience isn’t just a sea of faces—it’s a living tapestry of memories, each person a fragment of your past: the childhood friend who moved away, the teacher who believed in you before you did, the stranger who once held the door open on a rainy day. Their eyes aren’t just expectant; they’re *knowing*, as if they’ve been waiting for this speech their whole lives too.

You open your mouth, but no words come out. Instead, the air hums with a sound like wind through a canyon, and suddenly, the stage dissolves. You’re standing in the middle of a vast, sunlit field, the grass swaying in time with your heartbeat. The audience is still there, but now they’re not just watching—they’re *part of* the field, their bodies rooted like ancient trees, their faces shifting between human and something older, wilder. A woman in the front row—your grandmother, though she died before you were born—smiles and nods, and the ground beneath you ripples like water.

Then, the speech begins *without you*. Your voice isn’t coming from your throat; it’s rising from the earth itself, a chorus of whispers that swell into a single, resonant truth. The words aren’t in any language you know, but you *understand* them anyway:

*"You were never supposed to be here. And yet, here you are."*

The crowd erupts—not in applause, but in a sound like laughter and weeping tangled together. The field tilts, and you’re falling upward, the sky pulling you into its embrace. As you dissolve into the blue, you realize: this wasn’t a speech at all. It was an unraveling. A remembering. A beginning.

And then—

You wake up with your heart pounding, the echo of the crowd still ringing in your ears. Your hands are clenched around the edge of your pillow, and for a moment, you swear you can still feel the grass between your fingers.

(What do *you* think the dream means?)
