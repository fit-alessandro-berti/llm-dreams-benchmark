…hesitate at first, unsure whether to trust them. But something in their gentle smiles and unhurried voices eases the weight in your chest. They walk beside you, not leading too fast, not pushing, just moving with you through the tide of people. As you wander together, the noisy city begins to change—colors seem warmer, the air feels lighter, and every building you pass hums faintly as if whispering stories.  

One of the strangers points out a hidden doorway between two towering shops, a place you never would have noticed on your own. Inside, you find a quiet courtyard strung with soft lights, a fountain at its center spilling water that glitters like starlight. For the first time in what feels like forever, you stop moving. You breathe.  

The group tells you that the city is full of secret spaces like this—safe havens for those who feel adrift. They assure you that you are never truly lost here, that the city itself will guide you if you learn to look with a softer gaze.  

Your loneliness begins to melt into a gentle warmth, and suddenly the dream shifts. Instead of being a stranger in a sprawling maze, you feel as though you are part of something vast, welcoming, and alive.  

Would you like me to extend the dream toward a moment of revelation—where you discover *why* these strangers appeared—or guide it toward a gentle waking, as though their message is something you carry back into your real life?
