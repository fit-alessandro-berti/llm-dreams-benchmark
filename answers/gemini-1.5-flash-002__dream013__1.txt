You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, the puzzles become increasingly surreal.  One moment you're manipulating gravity to align floating glyphs, the next you're deciphering riddles whispered by giggling shadows that shift and change shape with every answer.  The air grows colder, the stone walls seeming to breathe faintly with a luminescent moss.  

You solve a puzzle involving the precise arrangement of musical notes that somehow unlocks a hidden passage, revealing a breathtaking vista of a city built on impossible geometry, floating amongst swirling nebulae.  But the beauty is fleeting; the city starts to crumble as you watch, the nebulae turning into a swirling vortex of colours that threaten to suck you in.  You realize this is another puzzle – a test of your ability to let go.  

Instead of focusing on saving the impossible city, you concentrate on a small, unassuming key that had appeared in your hand after solving the musical puzzle.  It’s made of oddly smooth, warm wood, pulsing faintly with a gentle light.  You insert it into a seemingly ordinary stone in the wall, and the entire maze begins to dissolve around you, not with a bang, but a soft sigh.  You awaken in your bed, the faint scent of woodsmoke lingering in the air, clutching the small wooden key, which has vanished as soon as you open your eyes.  The memory of the impossible city, however, remains, a vivid and unforgettable dream-fragment, a testament to a puzzle you solved not with logic, but with acceptance.
