…completely blank. The paper is pristine, as if someone wiped away every word before handing it to you. You look around the room, but all the other students are staring at their own empty exams, faces twisted in confusion and anxiety.

The professor stands at the front, watching silently, a knowing smile playing on their lips. You try to remember what you studied, but your mind feels foggy, and the harder you try, the more the details slip away.

Suddenly, the room starts to shift around you. The desks melt into clouds, the walls dissolve into a starry sky, and you find yourself floating above the exam hall. Below, the world blurs into a patchwork of colors and shapes.

A gentle voice whispers in your ear: “This is not a test of what you know, but of what you imagine.” You realize you have the power to fill in the questions yourself. As you think of your dreams and aspirations, the blank paper begins to fill with glowing, handwritten text—stories, inventions, places you want to go, lives you want to lead.

You wake up just as you’re about to write your name at the bottom of the page, heart racing, the memory of possibility lingering in your mind.
