You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to rally a ragtag group of survivors—fellow wanderers you've met along the ruined highways—and build a hidden sanctuary in the overgrown ruins of an old national park. It's not easy; mutated beasts prowl the underbrush, and rival scavengers raid your fledgling gardens of hydroponic veggies grown from salvaged seeds. But as you fortify the walls with scrap metal and solar panels, hope flickers like the fireflies that return at dusk. One night, under a starlit sky unpolluted by city lights, you discover an ancient bunker beneath the earth, stocked with pre-collapse tech that could change everything. The dream blurs as alarms wail— is it a trap, or salvation? You wake with the taste of irradiated rain on your lips, wondering if the sanctuary was real.
