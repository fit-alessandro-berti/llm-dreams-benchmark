…speak, but at first, your voice comes out as a whisper, barely audible. You clear your throat, and suddenly, a single spotlight shines down, illuminating you in a pool of golden light. The room is impossibly quiet. You look down at your notes, but the words are swirling, dancing off the page in shimmering, iridescent patterns.

You take a deep breath and decide to speak from your heart. As you do, the words find you—they rise up from within, flowing out smooth and effortless. The crowd begins to lean in, rapt, their faces glowing with attention. With every sentence, your confidence grows. The air around you thickens, humming with possibility, and you catch glimpses of faces you know—friends, mentors, and even strangers smiling, nodding encouragement.

And then, with a strange dream logic, the stage expands outward—its edges dissolving into a field of wildflowers. The audience becomes part of the landscape, flowers themselves, swaying gently in the breeze as your words ripple out, settling softly on every petal, every leaf. You realize you are not nervous, you have never been nervous; you are exactly where you are meant to be, the speech unfolding exactly as it should—a conversation with the world itself.
