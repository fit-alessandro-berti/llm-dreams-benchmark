…you feel a storm approaching and the air turns thick, like it’s holding its breath.

The leaves stop rustling. Even the birds go quiet. Above you, the sky darkens in layers—gray over green over a strange, bruised violet—as if someone is painting it too quickly. Wind slides through the trees in sudden cold fingers, tugging at your clothes and pushing you forward along the path whether you mean to go or not.

A low rumble rolls through the ground before it reaches the clouds.

You look for shelter, but the forest has rearranged itself. The trail you were on is still there, yet it’s narrower now, threaded between trunks that seem closer together than they were a moment ago. The trees lean inward, listening. When the first raindrop hits your forehead it doesn’t feel like water—it feels like a tiny, warm pulse, like a fingertip tapping your skin to get your attention.

Then the rain comes all at once.

It falls in straight, silver lines that don’t splash when they land. Each drop sinks into the soil without sound, and the scent that rises isn’t wet earth—it’s something bright and clean, like crushed mint and old paper. Lightning flashes, but instead of jagged white it blooms into soft shapes: a doorway, a staircase, a hand held out in the dark. They vanish before you can make sense of them.

You run.

Not in panic exactly—more like urgency, the sense that something is catching up with you or waiting for you just ahead. Branches whip past. The world narrows to your breath and the drum of rain and a growing hum in your ears, like distant singing through a wall.

Ahead, the trees open into a clearing.

In the center sits a still pond, black as polished stone, untouched by the rain. Drops strike the surface and simply disappear, as if the water is swallowing them before they can make ripples. Mist coils above it in slow, deliberate spirals.

At the edge of the pond is a figure.

Not frightening—just impossible to focus on. When you try to look directly, your eyes slide off the details the way they do with certain words you can’t quite remember. You can tell it’s facing you. You can tell it has been waiting a long time.

The storm quiets, as if pausing to hear what happens next.

The figure lifts one arm and points—not at you, but at the pond. And in the pond, the darkness thins. Something shines beneath the surface, not like a lightbulb but like moonlight caught in a cracked mirror.

You step closer. The air around the pond is warmer, almost gentle. The humming in your ears resolves into a melody you recognize without knowing why, a tune that makes your chest ache with familiarity.

When you kneel, you see it.

Your own reflection, but not quite. The you in the water is standing in a different forest, under a clear sky, holding something in its hands. It’s looking back at you with the same startled concentration you feel now, like two people meeting across a window.

The you in the pond raises its hands and presses them flat against the invisible surface.

Instinctively, you do the same.

The “water” feels like cool glass. It pushes back. Your fingertips tingle, as if your nerves are suddenly waking up. The storm begins again—but far away now, like it’s happening in another world.

The figure behind you speaks for the first time, its voice not quite sound, more like a thought placed gently in your mind:

*You can leave the storm here. Or you can take it with you.*

You don’t know what that means, but you feel the weight of it—like choosing whether to keep carrying something you’ve gotten used to holding.

In the pond, your other self opens its hands.

Inside is a small object: a seed, or a pebble, or a key. It keeps changing as you try to name it, as if it refuses to be reduced to one simple thing. Whatever it is, it glows softly, and when it does the trees around the clearing lean back, giving you room to breathe.

You look up at the sky. The clouds churn, but you notice now that they aren’t moving randomly. They circle the clearing like an eye, like a gate. The wind tugs at you again—more politely this time—waiting.

You look back at the pond. Your reflection-mouth moves, and you hear the words inside your head instead of through your ears:

*Wake up with it.*

Your hand hesitates on the glass. The figure behind you says nothing now, but you feel it watching, patient as a stone, patient as time.

You press harder.

The surface gives. It isn’t breaking—it’s opening. Cold rushes up your arm, not painful, just startling, and for a moment you are pulled forward like a thread through a needle.

You stumble, and the world flips.

The rain is gone.

You are standing in the other forest—the one from the reflection—with sunlight spilling between branches like poured honey. Everything is impossibly crisp: the edges of leaves, the texture of bark, the distant call of a bird returning cautiously to the world.

In your palm is the object from the pond. Now it holds steady as a small key, tarnished brass, warm from your skin.

Behind you, you hear thunder.

You turn. Through the trees, far back where the forest thickens, you see the storm you left behind. It is contained now, turning in place like a trapped animal, dark but no longer chasing you.

The key grows heavier, as if reminding you that you brought something with you on purpose.

A narrow path appears ahead—new, freshly made, as though the grass has just decided to lie down and let you pass. Along the edges of the path, small white flowers open one by one in your wake, not blooming but waking.

You take a step.

Somewhere, very close, you hear a familiar sound: your alarm clock, muffled and distant, like it’s ringing from the bottom of a lake. The sunlight flickers. The forest holds its breath again, but this time it feels like anticipation, not fear.

You tighten your fingers around the key.

You follow the path.

And just before the waking world pulls you apart from the dream, you catch a glimpse of what the key fits: a door in the side of an old tree, half-hidden by moss, with your name carved into the bark in handwriting you recognize as your own.

The alarm grows louder.

You reach for the door—

—and wake up with the feeling of rain on your skin, and something small and solid in your closed fist that takes you a moment to realize isn’t there anymore.
