fall into step with them as if you’ve always known their cadence. One has a pocket full of folded transit maps that unfold into paper cranes; another wears a scarf the color of dawn, trailing a soft ribbon of warmth that doesn’t quite touch the pavement. The tallest one carries a cup of tea that never spills, steam drawing shapes in the air—arrows, a small compass, your initials looping like a secret signature.

They don’t ask where you’re going. They ask what you’re listening for. You tilt your head and the city answers: bus brakes sigh like the sea, crosswalks tick like small clocks, a market awning flaps a steady heartbeat. They teach you to step where the sound feels familiar. East is the glassy ring of laughter. West is the hush of pages turning. When you hesitate at an intersection, the crane maps lift, flutter, and settle on a route that seems to remember you.

You pass a window where the mannequins are dressed in last summer’s air, pass a bakery that smells like a story your grandmother once told you on a rain-polished afternoon. A cat with silver whiskers keeps pace along a low wall, tail held high, guiding like a needle. Above, billboards rearrange themselves until the negative space between letters spells a word you haven’t said aloud in years.

The strangers bring you to a narrow door painted the color of your favorite sweater, a color you’d forgotten had a name. No sign, no buzzer—just your reflection, steady and unafraid. The tallest offers the tea; the steam drifts into a small, glowing thread that winds around your wrist and tugs gently inward. When you push the door, the city quiets. Inside is a courtyard that smells of oranges, with a bench warmed by sunlight that has been waiting specifically for you. A fountain murmurs a lullaby you somehow know.

“This is your street,” one of them says, not meaning the map but the feeling. Their faces blur, then sharpen—strangers becoming classmates, a bus driver, a future friend, the person you’re trying to be. You thank them, and they nod as if you’ve answered the question you were asked when you were born.

When you look down, the thread has become a pulse in your palm. When you look up, the city has rearranged itself into something navigable: a sentence you can read, a song you can hum. You sit on the bench, breathe, and the world leans closer, as if to say: there you are.
