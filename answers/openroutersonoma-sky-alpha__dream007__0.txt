You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to storm off into the misty forest behind your childhood home, the one that's always felt like a portal to forgotten memories. Your friend calls after you, voice echoing like thunder, but you press on, heart pounding with that mix of fury and regret.

As you push through the underbrush, the trees begin to whisper secrets—old inside jokes, shared secrets from late-night talks—and the path twists unnaturally, leading not to a clearing but to a glowing doorway made of swirling autumn leaves. You hesitate, but curiosity wins; you step through, and suddenly you're both there again, face-to-face, but now in a vast library where the books are alive, their pages fluttering like birds' wings.

The argument reignites, fiercer than before, about that core issue—maybe it's about trust, or a dream you both chased but one of you let slip away. Words fly like sparks, but then the shelves start to melt, dripping into rivers of ink that form words on the floor: "Forgive." Your friend reaches out, and instead of shaking hands, you both tumble into a soft pile of forgotten stories, laughing as the ink washes away the anger. The dream fades with the scent of old paper and fresh rain, leaving you waking with a strange sense of peace, wondering if it was ever really an argument at all.
