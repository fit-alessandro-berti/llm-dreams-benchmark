As the storm approaches, the once peaceful forest begins to transform. The once vibrant green leaves turn a deep, eerie red, and the usually gentle breeze picks up, carrying with it a sense of urgency and danger. The trees around you seem to sway and shift, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers, casting long, dancing shadows on the forest floor.

You hear the distant rumble of thunder, growing louder and more insistent with each passing moment. The sky darkens rapidly, and the first few drops of rain begin to fall, heavy and cold. You quicken your pace, trying to find shelter before the storm hits.

As you run, you notice that the path you were walking on has disappeared, swallowed by the encroaching darkness. You find yourself in a dense thicket, the trees pressing in on all sides. You try to backtrack, but the ground is slick with rain, and the trees are too close together to navigate easily.

Suddenly, you hear a low growl behind you. You turn to see a massive, shadowy figure emerging from the darkness. It's a wolf, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light. It sniffs the air, then turns its attention to you.

What do you do?

1. Try to run away.
2. Stand your ground and prepare to fight.
3. Try to communicate with the wolf.
4. Look for something to hide behind.
