their conversations, which seem to be snippets of your own thoughts and experiences. The room begins to shift and change as you move through it, reflecting your feelings of anxiety and disorientation. Suddenly, you hear your friend's voice calling your name, but you can't locate its source. The walls start to close in on you, and the faces of the strangers around you become distorted and menacing.

Just when you feel like you might be trapped in this maze forever, you spot a familiar face in the crowd. It's a person you've known your whole life, someone who represents safety and comfort. As you approach them, the chaos around you begins to fade away. The room transforms into a serene, familiar setting, like a childhood home or a favorite park.

In this new space, your friend and the comforting presence engage in a conversation with you. They discuss the challenges you've been facing in your waking life, offering wisdom and support. As the dream comes to a close, you feel a sense of peace and resolution, as if you've gained clarity and strength to face your real-world struggles.

You wake up feeling refreshed and empowered, ready to tackle the day ahead.
