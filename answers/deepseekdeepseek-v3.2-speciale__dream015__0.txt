You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to climb the highest hill to get a better view of your surroundings. As you ascend, the air becomes clearer and you notice a faint rainbow arching over the horizon. At the hill's peak, you find an old, gnarled tree with a single ripe fruit hanging from a branch. You pluck it and take a bite, and suddenly, the world around you begins to heal: grass sprouts, water flows, and the sky brightens. The wasteland transforms into a vibrant landscape, teeming with life. People emerge from hiding, drawn by the change, and you realize that hope was the key all along. With that realization, you wake up, feeling oddly rejuvenated.
