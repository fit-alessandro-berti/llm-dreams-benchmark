accept their offer with a mix of relief and hesitation. The group is an eclectic mix—an elderly woman with silver hair braided with tiny blue flowers, a young skateboarder with a neon-green beanie, a quiet librarian-type with round glasses, and a street musician carrying a well-worn guitar case. They seem to know the city like the back of their hands, whispering to each other in a language that sounds almost like music.

They lead you down a narrow alleyway you’d never noticed before, its walls covered in murals that shift subtly when you blink—one moment a forest, the next a starry sky. The air smells of rain and warm bread, though the sky above is clear. The skateboarder grins and says, *"You’re not lost, you’re just in the in-between. Happens to the best of us."*

At the end of the alley, there’s a door—old, wooden, with a brass knocker shaped like a crescent moon. The librarian adjusts their glasses and murmurs, *"This is where you decide."* The musician strums a single, resonant chord, and the door hums in response, as if alive.

You reach out to touch the knocker, and the moment your fingers brush the metal, the city around you *shifts*. The streets dissolve into a vast, golden field under a twilight sky, and the strangers are now silhouettes against the horizon, waving. The elderly woman’s voice floats to you on the wind: *"Some doors only open when you’re ready to walk through them. But remember—you were never really alone."*

Then you wake up, your heart still thrumming with the echo of the guitar’s chord, and for a fleeting second, you swear you see a blue flower petal resting on your pillow.
