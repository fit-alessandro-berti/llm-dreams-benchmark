The peaceful hush of the dappled forest shatters. One moment, sunlight filters through the emerald canopy, painting the mossy ground in gold; the next, the air turns thick and electric, smelling of ozone and wet earth. The wind doesn’t just pick up—it *rips* through the trees, bending ancient oaks like saplings. Leaves, once gently whispering, now scream as they tear free, swirling in frantic eddies around your ankles.

Then, the rain. Not gentle drops, but a **deluge of liquid sorrow**. It hits not with the cool splash of water, but with the warm, heavy weight of tears. Each drop feels like a memory—sharp, specific, and aching. A raindrop on your cheek burns with the sting of a childhood rejection; another on your wrist carries the metallic tang of a forgotten fear. The forest path dissolves into mud that pulls at your feet like regret.

You stumble toward a massive, lightning-scarred oak, seeking shelter beneath its gnarled roots. But the storm isn’t *outside*. As you press your back against the damp bark, you realize the rain is falling **inside you**. Your chest heaves, not from running, but from a scream trapped since the first thunderclap—a scream made of every unsaid word, every buried grief. The "rain" streaming down your face? It’s your own tears, amplified a thousandfold by the dream’s logic. The thunder isn’t in the sky—it’s the pounding of your pulse in your ears, a drumbeat of panic.

Suddenly, the downpour stops. Not gradually, but *snapped* off, like a switch flipped. The wind dies mid-howl. In the eerie silence, the forest floor is littered not with leaves, but with **thousands of tiny, glowing seeds**. They pulse with soft, blue light where the "tear-rain" fell. As you kneel, trembling, one drifts into your palm. It’s warm. In that instant, a whisper rises—not from the trees, but from the seeds themselves, harmonizing with the voice of the child you once were:  
*"The storm wasn’t coming. It was you. And the calm was always here."*

You look up. The sky is clear now, impossibly deep twilight, stars blazing like freshly polished glass. The forest breathes slowly, peacefully again. But the seeds cling to your skin, humming with quiet light. You understand: the storm washed away what you’d buried. The forest isn’t just a place now—it’s a part of you, scarred and renewed. And the path ahead, glistening with starlight and seeds, feels not like escape… but like coming home.

*(You wake with your cheeks wet, the scent of rain and earth still in your nostrils—and the unshakable certainty that you’ve finally cried a tear* you’d been carrying since yesterday.)*  

This dream twists the classic "storm" trope into an internal awakening: the weather *is* your suppressed emotions, the forest your subconscious, and the aftermath isn’t destruction—but **fertile ground for rebirth**. Dreams rarely give easy answers; they hold up mirrors. What did *your* storm wash away? 🌧️🌳
