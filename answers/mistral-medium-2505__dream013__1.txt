encounter a grand, ornate door with intricate carvings of celestial symbols. The door is locked, and above it, a riddle is inscribed in glowing letters:

*"I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?"*

You ponder the riddle, recalling the echoes of your own footsteps in the maze. The answer—*an echo*—clicks into place. The door creaks open, revealing a vast chamber bathed in shifting, iridescent light. At its center stands a towering, ancient clockwork mechanism, its gears turning slowly, as if counting down to something unknown.

A voice, neither human nor machine, resonates through the chamber: *"To proceed, you must solve the final puzzle—the one that has no answer. What is the question you have never asked?"*

The maze, the puzzles, even the clockwork—all of it feels like a reflection of your own mind. You realize the true challenge isn’t logic, but self-awareness. The question you’ve never asked is the one that unlocks the next door.

What is it?
