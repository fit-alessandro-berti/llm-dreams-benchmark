You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to walk away—not out of anger, but because you suddenly feel the air around you thickening, like water rising to your waist. The walls of the room begin to ripple, melting into shifting constellations of forgotten memories: your tenth birthday, the night you both got lost in the forest behind your old school, the quiet hospital room where you held their hand when they were seven and terrified of the dark.

Your friend doesn’t follow. Instead, they speak—but their voice is no longer theirs. It’s layered, echoing with a dozen other voices: your mother, your childhood dog, the voice of the librarian who gave you your first fantasy novel, the wind through autumn trees.

“Why do you think we argue?” they ask, and it’s not a question. It’s a revelation.

The room fractures open, revealing not a house, but the inside of a giant, ancient tree—its bark etched with names of every person you’ve ever loved or lost. You realize: you are not arguing about the thing you thought you were. You’re arguing because you’re both afraid of letting go. Afraid that if you admit you’re wrong, you’ll lose the structure that holds your bond together.

A single leaf, glowing gold, drifts down from the canopy. You catch it.

It hums with your friend’s voice, whispering: *Love isn’t a wall. It’s a root. We grow toward each other, even when we twist away.*

You open your hand.

The leaf dissolves into light.

And for the first time in this dream, you don’t feel angry.

You feel… seen.

You turn to your friend, and they’re smiling—not triumphantly, not sadly—but gently, like the dawn after a long storm.

You say, “I’m sorry.”

They says, “Me too.”

And then, without a word, you both reach for each other’s hands.

And the world dissolves into the sound of your laughter—soft, true, and endless.
