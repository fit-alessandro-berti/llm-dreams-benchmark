The designs seem to shift when you blink, morphing into constellations, ancient runes, and fleeting glimpses of faces that vanish the moment you focus on them. As you trace a finger over the patterns, the box hums—a low, resonant sound that vibrates in your bones.  

Suddenly, the air grows heavy, and the box begins to **emit a soft, iridescent mist** that coils around your wrists. In the fog, a voice whispers in a language you’ve forgotten but somehow understand: *“What you seek is not inside, but the key lies in the echo of your own breath.”*  

You glance down and see your shadow stretching unnaturally, morphing into a key shape. As you reach for it, the box’s lid creaks open, revealing not treasure, but a **mirror that reflects not your face, but a door you’ve never seen**. Behind it, a hallway stretches into a sky filled with falling stars.  

The dream fades as you hear a laugh—your own, yet unfamiliar—and the box vanishes, leaving only the scent of ozone and the question: *Was this a puzzle, or a portal?*
