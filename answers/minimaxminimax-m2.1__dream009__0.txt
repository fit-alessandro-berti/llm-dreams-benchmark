You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **learn to survive using only your wits, your hands, and the knowledge you've carried across time without ever knowing it was there.**

The air smells different—cleaner, but also thick with wood smoke and something metallic, like heated iron from a distant forge. The sounds are wrong too. No hum of refrigerators, no distant hum of traffic. Just wind through unfamiliar trees, the creak of wooden wheels on dirt roads, and voices speaking in a language you somehow understand but can't quite place.

You find yourself in a small village of thatched-roof cottages, surrounded by people in rough-spun clothing who stare at you with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. Your clothes are wrong—too strange, too clean, too perfectly fitted. A child tugs at your sleeve and says something you don't quite catch, but the gesture is universal: *Come. Come see.*

What follows is a journey through a world that moves at the speed of seasons rather than seconds. You learn that you need to master skills you never thought you'd need: how to churn butter, how to read the stars for navigation, how to mend a torn garment with needle and thread. You discover that survival here isn't about the speed of connection but the depth of community—that neighbors really do borrow cups of sugar, and that a harvest festival matters more than any deadline you've ever met.

But the hardest thing you realize you need to find is your purpose. Why are you here? What is the dream trying to tell you? Perhaps it's showing you that the technology you thought you couldn't live without was just a curtain—and behind it lies something older, more permanent, more true.

You begin to wonder: when (or if) you wake up, what will you bring back with you?
