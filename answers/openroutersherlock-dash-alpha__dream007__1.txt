You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **challenge them to a duel at dawn—with water balloons instead of swords. As the first pink rays of sunrise hit the park, you both arm yourselves from a massive pile of colorful orbs, laughing through gritted teeth. The first splash explodes across your chest, cold and triumphant, but they nail you square in the face next. The fight devolves into chaos: slipping on wet grass, accidental alliances with squirrels stealing balloons, and a sudden rainstorm that turns everything into a glorious, muddy truce. You collapse together, soaked and breathless, the argument forgotten in the absurdity, waking with a grin and a vague urge to buy balloons.**
