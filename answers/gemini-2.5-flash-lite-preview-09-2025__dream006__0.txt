As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to **realize your mouth is full of brightly colored, slightly squishy marbles.**

The silence in the auditorium is suddenly deafening, broken only by the faint, high-pitched *clink* as one of the marbles rolls precariously close to your lower lip. You can feel the smooth, cool surfaces pressing against your tongue, making coherent speech an absolute impossibility.

You try to smile, but your face feels frozen in a peculiar grimace. You gesture with your hands, trying to mime the words you *want* to say—*“Good evening, ladies and gentlemen…”*—but your gestures come out instead as frantic, interpretive dance moves that seem to suggest you are either wrestling an invisible octopus or demonstrating the proper technique for kneading very dense dough.

The audience doesn't react with confusion, though. Instead, their expectant faces slowly transform into expressions of rapt admiration. They are leaning forward, nodding sagely, their eyes wide with comprehension.

A woman in the front row bursts into tears of emotion, dabbing her eyes with a silk handkerchief. A man near the back slowly stands up, applauding with the slow, deliberate rhythm of someone deeply moved by profound, unspoken truth.

You realize that **they aren't waiting for words; they are waiting for the *meaning* carried by the marbles.**

Panicked, you try to speak again, letting out a small, choked sound that manages to dislodge a single, iridescent blue marble. It drops onto the polished wooden stage with a sharp *tink*.

The entire audience gasps in unison, leaning in even closer as if the sound itself contains the secret to the universe. You watch the blue marble roll slowly toward the edge of the stage.

Driven by instinct, you decide to embrace the absurdity. You tilt your head back and, with a final surge of dream logic, you begin to **intentionally cough up the marbles, launching them into the air like glittering, multi-colored confetti.**

Each marble that catches the stage lights seems to trigger a unique reaction in the crowd. A streak of vibrant green sends a wave of quiet, contented sighs through the seats. A large, cloudy white one causes the entire audience to simultaneously stand on one leg.

You are now showering the expectant faces with luminous, slightly sticky spheres, and the feeling isn't panic anymore—it’s exhilarating. You realize this isn't a speech; it’s a **performance art piece about the beautiful inarticulacy of existence.**

As the last, warm, golden marble escapes your lips and bounces near the footlights, the audience rises as one, not to applaud, but to **begin slowly melting, dissolving into puddles of perfectly clear, warm water that mirror the stage lights.**

You look down at your hands, expecting to see them dissolving too, but instead, you find you are holding a single, perfectly ripe, slightly fuzzy peach. You take a bite, and the sound of the crunch is the loudest, clearest sound in the entire, now-silent, watery theater.

Then, you wake up.
