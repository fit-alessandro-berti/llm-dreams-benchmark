*The lighting in the room shifts—once warm, now sharp and flickering. A woman in a red dress turns your way.*  
"Do you hear that?" *her smile widens, teeth too perfect, almost gleaming*

- Distant laughter, then silence.  
- A glass shatters.  
- A voice calls your name. *It’s not the person you came with.*  

*Your friend’s face is nowhere to be seen. The room feels...contracting.*
