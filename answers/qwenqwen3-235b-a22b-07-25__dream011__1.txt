…written in a language that constantly shifts—letters rearranging themselves like schools of fish swimming across the page. The first question begins in English, then melts into Cyrillic, then becomes symbols you almost recognize—constellations, maybe, or the sigils from an old almanac your grandmother used to keep.  

You try to focus, but your pen has no ink, and when you ask the invigilator for another, she smiles and hands you a feather. “Use what you’re given,” she says, her voice oddly echoing, like it’s coming from down a long tunnel.  

Panicked, you look around the exam hall. Other students are writing furiously, their pens scratching like insects, but when you glance at their papers, they’re filled with diagrams of labyrinths, musical notes, or blank—completely blank. One student is drawing a tree whose roots grow upward into the sky. Another is knitting with red thread that seems to stretch into the floor.

You turn back to your own paper. The question has changed again. Now it simply reads:  
**“Who taught you that answers matter more than questions?”**  

And beneath it, your hands—without your permission—begin to write, in perfect, looping script:  
*“You did. Every time you were afraid to not know.”*  

Suddenly, the walls of the exam hall dissolve into mist. The desks fade. The other students turn toward you, not with judgment, but with quiet recognition. The invigilator nods, closing a book you hadn’t noticed before—your childhood journal, filled with scribbled dreams you thought you’d forgotten.  

And you realize: you’re not being tested.  
You’re being remembered.  

The final page of the exam now shows only a mirror.  
And in it, you see not the face of a student—  
but of someone already becoming who they were meant to be.
