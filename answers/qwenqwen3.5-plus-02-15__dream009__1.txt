You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need **to find water before the sun reaches its zenith**.

The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, utterly devoid of the sterile hum of electricity or the glow of screens. You are standing on a cobblestone path that winds through a village of timber-framed houses with thatched roofs. People in rough-spun wool and linen glance at you with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion, their faces marked by the labor of the land.

Your throat is parched, a stark reminder that in this time, survival isn't automated. There are no taps, no plastic bottles, no refrigerators humming in the corner. You watch a woman drawing water from a communal well using a wooden bucket and a rope, her movements rhythmic and practiced.

You approach cautiously, mimicking the modest posture of those around you. When it's your turn, the rope burns your palms, rougher than anything you've touched in years. As you lift the heavy bucket, the cool, metallic taste of the water shocks your system, waking you up even more than the strange surroundings did.

As you drink, you realize your second, more pressing need: **to understand the rules of this world before you accidentally break them**. A blacksmith pauses his hammering to stare at your synthetic sneakers; a child points at the digital watch still strapped to your wrist, which now looks like an alien artifact. You quickly cover it with your sleeve, knowing that in an era where time is measured by the sun and church bells, your modern accessories could mark you as a sorcerer or a spy.

You take a deep breath, the dream logic settling in. You need to blend in, to learn the rhythm of this slower, harder life, and perhaps, just perhaps, figure out why your mind has transported you here before you can wake up again.
