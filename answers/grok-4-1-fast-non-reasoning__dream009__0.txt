You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **adapt quickly to survive in this medieval world of thatched huts, muddy streets, and flickering torchlight**.

The air smells of woodsmoke, manure, and fresh-baked bread from a nearby market. Villagers in rough woolen tunics eye you suspiciously—your strange clothes mark you as an outsider, maybe a traveler from distant lands or worse, a spy. No smartphones, no cars, no electricity; the sun is your clock, and a rusty sword half-buried in the dirt nearby hints at the dangers ahead.

Your stomach growls fiercely. First things first: **scavenge or barter for food**. You spot a cart laden with apples and loaves, guarded by a burly merchant with a wooden club. Do you approach with a silver tongue, offering stories of "far-off kingdoms" in trade? Or sneak around back, risking a chase through the alleys?

As you decide, a horn blares from the hilltop castle. Raiders are spotted on the horizon—bandits on horseback, banners flapping. The villagers scramble, grabbing pitchforks and spears. **You need to choose a side: join the defense, flee into the woods, or use this chaos to your advantage?**

Suddenly, a cloaked figure slips you a note: "The old oak at midnight. Secrets of return await." Dream or destiny? Your heart races—what do you do next?
