You start to run, but the pavement beneath your feet feels soft, like moss covered in velvet. The skyscrapers around you aren't made of steel and glass, but of stacked, translucent books that glow from within. Every step you take stretches the street further, pulling the horizon away like taffy.

You check your wrist for the time, but your watch face is blank, shimmering like a pool of mercury. There are no hands, only ripples. You realize with the sudden, unquestionable certainty of dreams that you aren't late; time here doesn't move forward, it moves *inward*.

A subway train glides past you on silent rails, though there are no tracks. The doors hiss open. Inside, the seats are empty, upholstered in deep green moss. You step in, and the doors close. There is no sensation of motion, yet the stations flash by outside the windows—not underground stops, but memories: your childhood kitchen, a beach you visited once, a classroom from long ago.

The train slows and stops. The doors open to reveal a single door standing alone in a field of tall, silver grass. It looks exactly like the front door of your first home. You know this is the meeting place.

You walk through the grass, which chimes like tiny bells when you brush against it. You turn the knob and enter. There is no office, no boardroom, no people in suits. There is only a large mirror covering the far wall. You walk toward it, and your reflection doesn't mimic you. Instead, it smiles, hands you a key, and points behind you.

You turn around. The room is now your current bedroom. The morning light is filtering through the curtains. The key in your hand feels heavy and real.

" The meeting was," a voice whispers from the corners of the room, "to remind you where you are."

You blink, and the city dissolves into the sound of your alarm clock buzzing. You wake up with the taste of silver grass in your mouth and a key clenched in your fist.
