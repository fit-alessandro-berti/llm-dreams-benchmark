You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to run, your breath catching in your throat, the panic a cold hand gripping your stomach. The city stretches out endlessly, a dizzying array of impossibly tall, angular buildings that seem to lean in on you, their windows like unblinking eyes.

You try to read street signs, but the symbols twist and morph before your eyes, shifting from elegant script to alien glyphs, then to meaningless patterns. You hail a passing tram, its polished brass glinting, but it glides silently past, its occupants faceless silhouettes. The air is thick with a strange, metallic scent, like old rain and forgotten secrets.

You ask a woman sitting by a fountain, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat, but her voice is a whisper of rustling leaves, and she simply gestures vaguely towards the horizon. Each turn you take leads to another identical, anonymous street. The city seems to fold in on itself, an endless loop of grey concrete and shadowy alleys.

As minutes bleed into what feels like seconds, the ground beneath your feet begins to subtly undulate, as if the entire city is breathing. Distant church bells chime, but the sound is warped, stretching and shrinking like rubber. A frantic urgency builds, a pressure behind your eyes. You know this meeting is vital, the most important thing you've ever had to do, yet the goal remains infuriatingly out of reach.

Then, just as the last vestiges of hope drain from you, a faint, resonant hum begins to vibrate in your bones. It's not a sound you hear with your ears, but one you feel deep within your chest. It grows stronger, guiding you down a narrow, moss-covered alley you swear wasn't there a moment ago. The walls here are not concrete, but shimmering obsidian, reflecting fragmented images of yourself, older, younger, slightly distorted.

The hum leads you to a door, heavy and unmarked, pulsating with a soft, internal light. You push it open, and instead of an office, you step into a vast, silent chamber where the ceiling is the swirling cosmos, and the floor is a perfect, still lake. A single, enormous chair sits in the middle, empty. The meeting isn't about *where* you are, you realize, but *that you arrived*. The meeting is with the city itself, or perhaps, with your own silence. The urgency fades, replaced by a profound, dreamlike calm. You sit in the empty chair, and the stars above begin to slowly spin.
