You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel a wave of panic wash over you. You look down at the project brief in your hands, trying to make sense of the complex requirements and the tight timeline.

As you start to voice your concerns about the feasibility of completing the project on time, your boss's face begins to morph into a grotesque caricature. His eyes bulge out, and his mouth stretches into an unnaturally wide grin. He leans in close to you, his breath hot on your face, and whispers, \ have no choice. Failure is not an option.\ walls of your office start to close in on you, and the room begins to spin. You try to run, but your legs feel heavy, as if you're wading through thick mud. You look back and see your boss, now a towering, monstrous figure, chasing after you with outstretched arms.

You manage to break free from the office and find yourself in a labyrinth of endless cubicles. Your co-workers are all hunched over their desks, their faces blank and expressionless. As you navigate the maze, you realize that the project brief in your hands is changing, the requirements shifting and multiplying before your eyes.

Just as you feel like you can't take it anymore, you spot a door at the end of a long corridor. You sprint towards it, your heart pounding in your chest. As you reach for the door handle, you hesitate, afraid of what might lie on the other side. But with the sound of your boss's footsteps growing louder behind you, you take a deep breath and turn the handle.

You wake up with a start, your heart racing and your forehead beaded with sweat. It takes a moment for you to realize that it was all just a dream, and you're safe in your own bed. You breathe a sigh of relief, but the lingering sense of dread from the nightmare remains, a reminder of the pressures and anxieties that often come with the modern workplace.
