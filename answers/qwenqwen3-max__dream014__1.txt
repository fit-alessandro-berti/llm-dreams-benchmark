You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you...

...hesitate for just a heartbeat—years of caution whispering in your ear—before nodding. Their faces are soft with empathy, not pity, and one of them, a woman with silver-streaked hair and eyes that seem to hold whole constellations, gently takes your elbow. “We know these streets,” she says, her voice warm like tea on a winter morning. “They twist and turn, but they always lead somewhere.”

They don’t ask where you’re going. Instead, they begin walking, weaving through alleys draped in ivy and neon, past food carts steaming with spices you can’t name, under bridges strung with paper lanterns that glow like captured fireflies. With every step, the city shifts—not just around you, but within you. The weight in your chest lightens. The noise of traffic fades into a rhythm, almost musical.

One of the strangers, a young man with paint-stained fingers, points to a mural on a crumbling wall: it’s a map, but not of streets or subways. It shows rivers of starlight, mountains made of old books, and a door marked only with your name. “That’s your destination,” he says simply. “Not a place on any GPS. But you’ll know it when you see it.”

As you reach a quiet plaza where fountains bubble with water that smells like rain and rosemary, the group stops. The silver-haired woman smiles. “We’ve walked far enough with you,” she says. “The rest is yours to find.”

You look around, and they’re already fading—not vanishing, but dissolving into the golden haze of late afternoon, their shapes blurring into the crowd like watercolors on wet paper. But you’re not afraid anymore. You feel the map in your pocket—not paper, but something warmer, pulsing gently like a second heartbeat.

And ahead, through an archway draped in wisteria, you see a door. Your door.

You walk toward it, not lost anymore—but found, and finding still.
