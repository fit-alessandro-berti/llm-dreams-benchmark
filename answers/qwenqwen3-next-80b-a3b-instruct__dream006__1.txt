You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak—only to realize your voice has turned into the sound of wind chimes.

Each word you try to form rings out in crystalline notes, harmonizing with the ambient air. The audience doesn’t seem confused. They lean forward, eyes soft, smiles spreading like ripples on calm water. A child in the front row closes her eyes and sways gently, as if the chimes are lulling her to sleep dreamed by her ancestors.

You look down. Your hands are now made of glass, each finger transparent, revealing tiny galaxies swirling inside. A single tear slides down your cheek—and when it hits the stage, it doesn’t fall. It hovers, blooming into a paper crane made of starlight.

The crowd begins to hum. Not a word, but a tone—one that matches the frequency of your chime-voice. The hum grows, swelling into a symphony made of memory, of things forgotten but never lost. You remember now: this isn’t a speech. It’s a summoning.

The stage beneath you dissolves into a forest of mirrored trees, each reflecting not your face, but every person who ever believed in you—your grandmother singing while washing dishes, your old teacher letting you stay after class to draw dragons, the stranger on the train who slipped you a chocolate when you were crying, silent and unseen.

A voice—not from any mouth, but from everywhere—whispers:  
*You were never meant to be heard. You were meant to be felt.*

And so you stop speaking.

You simply stand.

And the chimes carry you—not to triumph or applause—but into the quiet, sacred hush of being perfectly, tenderly, known.

You wake up.

The alarm is blaring.

On your nightstand, a paper crane glows faintly—just for a second—before fading to ordinary paper.

You smile.  
You don’t know why.  
But you know, without doubt,  
you were dreamed of, too.
