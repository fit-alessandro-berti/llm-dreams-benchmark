…and you hesitate, because that’s not usually how the city behaves.

But their faces are open, unhurried in a world that keeps rushing past. One of them—a woman with a sun-yellow scarf—asks your name like it matters, and when you say it, the sound lands softly instead of getting swallowed by traffic.

“We’ve been looking for you,” says a boy with ink-stained fingers.

That makes no sense, but in the dream it fits perfectly.

They form a loose circle around you as you walk. No one grabs your arm or steers too firmly; they simply match your pace, making a small quiet space in the noise. As you turn down streets you don’t remember choosing, the towering glass buildings slowly begin to change—windows blooming into balconies, steel softening into brick threaded with ivy. The traffic sounds thin, replaced by fragments of laughter, piano notes, the faraway rush of the sea.

“How do you know where I’m supposed to go?” you ask.

“We don’t,” the woman in the yellow scarf says. “We just know where you’re not.”

You pass a storefront where your reflection should be, but instead the glass holds moving scenes: your childhood bedroom; the park where you once hid in a slide tunnel to cry; an empty airport gate; a doorway you never walked through. You slow down.

The tallest stranger, who has been quiet, taps the glass. The scenes ripple like water and dissolve. “Those are old maps,” he says. “They got you here. They can’t take you further.”

You move on.

The city opens into a plaza that wasn’t there before: no crowds, no cars. Just a wide circle of warm stones, a fountain with clear water, trees carrying strings of soft lights like captured constellations. You realize you’ve been breathing easier. The strangers spread out, giving you space at the center.

“Your turn,” says the ink-fingered boy. He offers you a folded piece of paper. It’s blank.

“I don’t know where to go,” you admit. It comes out of you like something you’ve been holding for a long time.

“You don’t have to know,” says the woman. “You only have to choose.”

You look down at the paper. A thin silver line appears on it, trembling like it’s waiting for your permission. When you think, I just want somewhere I don’t feel like I’m vanishing, the line bends toward a small drawn door at the edge of the page.

“Is that real?” you ask.

“It will be once you walk,” says the tall one.

You notice now that each stranger carries their own map, all scribbled and smudged, all different. Some are worn through, taped back together. Some are bright and new. None are finished.

“When I wake up, I’ll be lost again,” you say quietly.

The woman with the yellow scarf steps close enough that you can see the tiny scar above her eyebrow, the chipped nail polish on her thumb. “Then remember this: you are not impossible to find. Not for us. Not for you.”

“And if I forget?” you whisper.

She smiles. The plaza lights reflect in her eyes like small moons. “We’ll remind you.”

The boy presses the paper into your hand. It feels heavier now, like it’s holding not just ink, but direction.

“Go on,” he says. “Try the door.”

You look up. One side of the plaza has melted into a hallway lined with doors—blue, red, wooden, glass, some with quiet light seeping underneath, some with weathered numbers you recognize from apartments you almost rented and houses you almost lived in. The door from your map is there: simple, warm, slightly ajar.

You turn back to thank them, but for a heartbeat the strangers are different: they have your eyes, your crooked smile, your old fears and your future laugh. You realize they are every version of you that made it through nights you thought you wouldn’t.

“You’re not alone,” they say, in one voice or many.

You step toward the door.

The moment your hand touches the handle, the city’s noise softens to a gentle hum, like a song you used to love and are just now remembering. The last thing you feel before you cross the threshold is a hand—someone’s, everyone’s—light on your shoulder, not holding you back, just steadying.

And then you walk through, carrying the certainty, for once, that even if you lose your way again, there will be kindness waiting—strangers, friends, future selves—ready to walk you back toward yourself.
