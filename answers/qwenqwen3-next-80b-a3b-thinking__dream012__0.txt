The salt stings my eyelids as I grip the wheel, knuckles white against the cold, wet wood. The *Aurora’s Resolve* groans like a living thing—timbers shuddering, rigging shrieking—beneath a sky the color of bruises. Waves aren’t just tall; they’re mountains of black water that rise, then collapse onto the deck with the force of a collapsing building. Rain lashes horizontal, and the wind roars in my ears like a beast devouring the world.  

I glance back at my crew. Young Tom, usually grinning like mad, now stands frozen at the bowsprit, eyes wide with terror, his gloveless hands clutching the line. Mara, our oldest hand, is lashed to the mainmast, her face streaked with saltwater and something darker—grief? Fear? They’re all looking at me. Not for orders, but for *proof* that this isn’t the end. That *I* believe it isn’t.  

My heart hammers against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat drowning out the storm. *Breathe*, I tell myself. *Breathe like you taught them.* The ship’s a beast, yes—but one I’ve learned to read. The way the water parts at the stem, the way the wind screams through the shrouds? That’s the storm’s rhythm. And every cycle, every surge, teaches us something. I shift my weight, leaning into the wheel’s resistance. *Into the wind*, we call it—not away from it, but *at* it. It’s the only way the ship stays alive.  

I shout, my voice raw but steady, cutting through the chaos: **"All hands! Ease the mainsail—let the wind take it! Tom, release the foresheet—slowly! Mara, take the binnacle—read me the compass, even if you have to scream it!"**  

They move. Not perfectly, not confidently—but they move. Tom’s hands are shaking as he coils the line; Mara squints at the compass, her lips moving silently. The ship bucks, hemming us in between two towering waves, but for the first time in minutes, she *listens*. The wheel steadies in my grasp. The chaos hasn’t vanished—it’s still a screaming, thrashing monster—but now it has *edges*. Now we can work within them.  

As the ship surges up the side of a wave, cresting the dark water, I see it. Just a flicker of gold on the horizon—a lighthouse, impossibly distant, but *there*. Not salvation. Not yet. But a sign that the storm has limits. A reminder that maps exist beyond this fury. I don’t smile. I don’t cheer. I tighten my grip and meet the crew’s eyes, one by one.  

**"Hold the line,"** I say, softer now, but firm. **"We’re not done. Not today."**  

And for the first time since the clouds swallowed the sun, the *Aurora’s Resolve* answers—not with a groan, but with a quiet, defiant hum. We’re still in the teeth of the storm. But we’re *navigating* it. And that’s enough.  

*(The dream fades not with calm, but with the sound of wind and waves—and the certainty that tomorrow’s sunrise would find us still sailing.)*
