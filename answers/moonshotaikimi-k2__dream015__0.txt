…follow the music.

It’s impossible, of course—cell towers fell years ago, guitar strings snapped, rivers claimed the last music boxes. And yet each twilight a single piano chord drifts between the blasted buildings, gentle as smoke, threading through broken windows and ribcage rebar. When the note fades, your chest hums the leftover resonance until the next dusk, and so you choose not to scavenge fuel or scurry down another sewer pipe. Carrying only an empty tin cup and the cracked boot knife you never learned to wield, you set out along the avenue of toppled billboards toward the sound.

The hazards appear quickly: rain-swollen vine-knots that try to corkscrew your ankles, a pack of feral Roombas scavenging lithium like mechanical raccoons, the wet-eyed weather balloons that meet you at crossroads, whispering barometric apologies before drifting on. You feed the balloons lies—say you’re heading in the opposite direction—so they’ll tell whatever’s hunting you the same.

At a bridge made of two school buses welded roof-to-roof, you caulk the tin cup under a drip of radiator water, sip rust-flavored hope. Here the chord thickens: a second layer, minor and pleading. You recognize it—something your mother played when you were seven and still thought the world large and kind. The grief in it now feels transformed, almost employable, like a tool turned inside out so the sharp edge faces away.

By moonrise you reach the source: a department store stripped to its skeletal escalators, still gliding with ghost power. Somehow its basement theater survived—the velvet seats mummified in dusk, stage lights replaced by bioluminescent fungus that mottles the curtains like green sunrise. At center stage stands a grand piano lid propped open; no bench, no pianist—just the ivory keys moving themselves as if the instrument has taught itself to breathe. Condensation trembles inside the lid, forming droplets that run down to hidden strings, and each fall re-plucks the chord.

You step closer. The hammers strike again, softer this time, an invitation. The cup trembles in your fingers: it’s collecting the condensed notes themselves—liquid sound—swirling like quicksilver. Against all common sense you raise the cup in a toast to the empty seats and drink.

Inside, music unfolds across your tongue with flavors of every forgotten lullaby. Your memory stitches itself differently: the years of scarcity appear not as a fracture but as a fermata—a pause in a longer composition you’d been too panicked to notice. Knees buzzing, you crawl onto the stage; the piano shifts aside, revealing a trapdoor lined with piano felt. It gasps open like a mouth waiting for a final consonant.

Down the velvet stairs lies a darker auditorium, seats submerged in two inches of calm water reflecting emergency exit lights in perfect red geometry. On a floating music stand drifts the next sheet: not paper, but living parchment—pale bark marked by moving veins of ink that rewrite the line as you read it. You understand instinctively that this second movement is yours to finish.

The resources here are not batteries or bullets but absence itself: a clean silence, a square of breathing room. With the knife you begin to carve a single word on the back of the stand—TRUST—letting the shavings scatter like curlicues on the water. The piano upstairs answers with a major resolution so resonant the floorboards sigh. Somewhere above, the moon sets; down here, a soft phosphorescence swells, as though you’ve just replaced the world’s removed heart.

Outside, the dangers remain: drought, raiders, the bitter calculus of tomorrow. You will still need to grow food, to boil water, to watch the corners of the night. But when morning light filters through the cracked proscenium, it arrives sounding exactly like the new chord you dreamed—steady, generous minor turning slowly toward major.

Time, you realize, has started learning the new harmony with you.
