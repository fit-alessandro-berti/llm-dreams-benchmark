...faint, bioluminescent veins pulsing beneath the dark wood, as if the box has a heartbeat.

The surface feels warm, almost feverish, against your fingertips. As you trace the swirling designs, the room around you begins to dissolve into a soft, violet fog, leaving you suspended in a space with no floor and no ceiling. You realize with sudden dream-clarity that the box isn't held shut by a latch, but by a *memory*.

You close your eyes and think of the smell of rain on hot asphalt. The box shudders. You think of the sound of your own name being whispered. The box hums, a vibration traveling up your arms and into your teeth.

Suddenly, the wood creates no resistance. It doesn't pop open; instead, the solid material turns into liquid, cascading over your hands like cool mercury.

Suspended in the space where the box used to be is not an object, but a color that doesn’t exist in the waking world—a shimmering, impossible hue that tastes like honey and sounds like a cello. You reach out to touch it, and the moment your finger makes contact, you wake up.
