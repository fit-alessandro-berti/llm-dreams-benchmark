...geometric lines that seem to shift when you look at them out of the corner of your eye. The wood feels impossibly warm, vibrating faintly against your fingertips like a living thing.

You realize suddenly that there is no keyhole. Instead, the patterns themselves are the lock. You press your thumb into the center of the design, and the wood yields like soft clay. The box groans, a low, melodic sound that resonates in your chest, and the intricate lines begin to swirl, turning into liquid gold.

The top of the box doesn't open; it dissolves, evaporating into a mist that smells of ozone and old books. Inside, there is no jewelry or money, but a small, perfectly spherical cloud. It churns slowly, flashing with tiny bolts of purple lightning.

As you lean in closer, a tiny hand made of fog reaches out from the cloud and gently taps your nose. A giggle, loud as thunder, echoes through the room, and suddenly you aren't in a room anymore—you are standing in a vast field of tall grass under a sky full of moons, and the box is gone, leaving only the scent of rain in the air.
