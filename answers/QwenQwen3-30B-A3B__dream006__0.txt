You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak. Your voice is steady, but as the words leave your mouth, they spiral into the air like smoke, twisting into shapes—birds, then origami cranes, then ash. The audience leans forward, captivated, but when you try to continue, your mouth moves without sound. Panic flickers. You glance down at your hands, which are now translucent, fingers dissolving into mist.  

The crowd’s faces blur, merging into a single, featureless void. You realize you’re not speaking to people at all—you’re addressing a mirror, but the reflection staring back is someone else: older, smiling, *you* but not you. The stage beneath you shudders, morphing into a vast, endless hallway lined with doors. Each door creaks open a crack, revealing fragments of memories—your childhood bedroom, a forgotten argument, a sunset you once watched alone.  

You stumble backward, but the hallway stretches infinitely. The silence is deafening until a single voice echoes from the shadows: *“You’re not ready to be heard.”* Suddenly, the doors slam shut, and you wake up, breathless, your mouth still shaped like the words you never spoke.
