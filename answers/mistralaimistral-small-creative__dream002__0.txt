As the storm rolls in, the once-serene forest transforms into a living, breathing entity—its trees swaying violently as if whispering warnings in a language just beyond your understanding. The air grows thick with the scent of ozone and damp earth, and the wind howls like a chorus of distant voices, carrying fragments of words you almost recognize.

You quicken your pace, but the path beneath your feet shifts—roots slither like serpents, twisting around your ankles, not to trip you, but to *guide* you. A low, rhythmic hum vibrates through the ground, and you realize it’s not the wind: it’s the forest *singing*. The song is ancient, mournful, and somehow familiar, as if you’ve heard it in another life.

Then, the rain begins—not in droplets, but in sheets of silver, each one carrying tiny, glowing motes of light. They swirl around you like fireflies, but when you reach out, they dissolve into your skin, leaving behind a warmth that spreads through your veins. Your vision sharpens; the colors of the forest deepen into hues you’ve never seen before—emeralds that pulse, violets that hum, golds that taste like honey on your tongue.

Ahead, the trees part to reveal a clearing where a single, towering oak stands, its bark etched with glowing runes that shift and rearrange like living script. At its base, a figure kneels—a woman (or perhaps a girl, or perhaps something older than both) with skin like bark and hair like vines. She turns her head slowly, and her eyes are two pools of starlight.

*"You’ve been walking in circles,"* she says, her voice the sound of leaves rustling in a language you suddenly understand. *"But circles are just spirals waiting to be unwound."*

She extends a hand, and in her palm lies a seed—pulsing, alive, its shell cracked just enough to reveal a sliver of light inside. *"Take it,"* she murmurs. *"Or don’t. But know this: the storm isn’t coming for you. It’s coming *from* you."*

Behind you, the wind howls your name.

**What do you do?**
*(Do you take the seed? Run? Ask her what she means? Or something else entirely?)*
