The coffee in your mug is coldâ€”the same cold coffee youâ€™ve been staring at for what feels like hours, though your watch says itâ€™s only 9:07 a.m. Then the door swings open. Your boss stands there, silhouetted against the harsh office lights, face blurred like a photograph in water.  

"**Ready for the Orion Project?**" Their voice is thin and metallic, cutting through the hum of fluorescent tubes. "Client wants it by **8:00 a.m. tomorrow**. The entire deliverableâ€”code, design, reports, everythingâ€”in **sixty seconds**."  

They toss a single sheet of paper on your desk. Itâ€™s blank except for one sentence:  
> ***"Organize the chaos into a universe."***  

Your heart hammers like a trapped bird. You glance at the wall clock: 9:08 a.m. The minute hand jerks forward. *Tick.* Itâ€™s already counting down. You scramble for your keyboard, but the keys melt into liquid gold as you touch them. The monitor flickersâ€”instead of code, it shows a childâ€™s drawing of a rainbow-covered moon. Outside the window, the sky is swirling with upside-down fish and floating typewriters.  

Your boss taps their wrist. "Timeâ€™s up."  

*A million thoughts collide in your head:*  
- *I canâ€™t write a universe in a secondâ€”*  
- *But the deadline is fakeâ€”*  
- *This is a dreamâ€”*  

Then you notice it: the clockâ€™s hands are dissolving into ribbons of light. The "impossible" deadline isnâ€™t a timerâ€”itâ€™s a **joke**. The paper on your desk shimmers, and the words rearrange themselves:  
> ***"The chaos was never real. Breathe."***  

You close your eyes. When you open them, youâ€™re lying in bed. Sunlight spills through the curtains. Your alarm clock blinks **6:00 a.m.**.  

Your phone buzzes. A work email sits in the inboxâ€”subject line: "**URGENT: Orion Project Kickoff (Deadline: 8:00 AM)**."  

You smile. The dream was just a shadow. But for a heartbeat, you remember the fish in the skyâ€”and feel impossibly, beautifully free.  

*(You wake up. The deadline is always somewhere else. But the chaos? Youâ€™re finally learning how to hold it gently.)* ðŸ’«
