You’re moving through a ballroom that feels as if it were cast in gentle twilight, even though there are chandeliers hanging above you and sconces lining the walls. The air is warm, heavy with the scent of rosewater and something you can’t quite identify, perhaps a hint of old wood or distant incense. Soft music drifts in from somewhere—maybe a quartet hidden behind a cluster of potted palms—and the low murmur of voices weaves through it all, a tapestry of laughter, gossip, and polite inquiry.

You know only one person here, your old friend from school, the one who always knew how to handle gatherings like this. They said to meet them by the grand fireplace at the far end of the hall, but as you try to thread your way through the throng, you realize that people keep forming little islands of conversation, forcing you to alter your path. Each small circle of guests is like a different, self-contained world, and you feel a gentle tug of curiosity as you approach them.

First, you come upon a trio of older women swathed in luminous silks and satins. Their gowns shift with subtle color when they move—one moment deep emerald, the next a shimmering gold. They smile at you in a knowing way, their eyes warm yet distant. One of them holds a fan carved from ivory and painted with delicate cranes; she asks if you have seen the collector who promised to show them a rare artifact tonight. Her voice lilts pleasantly, but you sense a subtle urgency underneath, as if this promised unveiling means more than mere curiosity. You can’t help them, you say, apologizing, and they nod graciously before turning back into their confidential huddle.

Next, you drift sideways to a small gathering of young men and women dressed in evening suits and sleek dresses cut in modern lines. They are perched around a low coffee table, sipping bright, jewel-colored drinks. They are talking about music—one claiming that the band playing tonight is “reviving an art lost centuries ago,” while another argues that it’s all just clever mimicry. When they catch sight of you, a young man with a thin mustache and a bright, mischievous gaze raises his glass in a silent toast. You return the gesture awkwardly, feeling the weight of their attentive eyes for a moment. One of them asks if you’ve tried the lavender-infused cocktails from the bar near the terrace. You haven’t, but you promise yourself you will, and excuse yourself gracefully.

Moving farther along, you see a gentleman by the window dressed head-to-toe in deep burgundy velvet. He stands apart, observing quietly. His hair is silvered at the temples, and his posture suggests he might have been a dancer once—his shoulders are drawn back, his chin held high. When you pass by, he nods and remarks softly that he’s noticed you are searching for someone. He doesn’t seem surprised by it. “Look near the flowers,” he says, voice low and melodious, “that’s where old friends tend to linger.” You thank him, a bit uncertain, wondering if he’s speaking metaphorically.

You follow his suggestion and try to reach the far side of the room, where towering vases of orchids and lilies are arranged atop mirrored pedestals. Before you get there, you catch sight of a small circle of people engaged in animated debate. They stand near a painting you hadn’t noticed before—a large canvas depicting a landscape where the trees are silver and the sky is streaked with violet. The discussion is passionate: two people argue that the painter must have glimpsed a secret world, while the third believes it’s all a trick of pigment and imagination. They pause when they see you, as though inviting you to weigh in. You feel suddenly important and a bit intimidated. Rather than getting drawn into their world, you smile politely and continue on, mindful of your task.

Finally, you near the back of the hall. The fireplace is enormous: its mantel carved with intricate patterns of leaves and berries, its flames dancing with unusual hues of green and blue. There, half-turning as if expecting you at any moment, you see your old friend. They wear a gentle smile and are talking with a small group of listeners who seem enraptured by some story they are telling. When your friend sees you, their eyes light up. They excuse themselves gracefully and come to greet you, drawing you aside. The relief you feel is immense—as if finding them was the real measure of success tonight.

As the two of you talk quietly, leaning in so that your voices won’t carry, the sense of strangeness and distance from the crowd melts away. Now, the chandeliers feel brighter. The laughter and whispers in the room hum like a comforting chorus. You breathe in deeply and realize you’ve completed a sort of journey. The faces you passed, the bits of conversation and glimpses of private worlds—they’ve all led you here, to this comforting reunion. The dream settles into a warmth, and everything around you grows pleasantly blurred and less urgent.

Somewhere in the back of your mind, you feel the dream loosening its hold, like the soft detachment of a leaf from a branch. But for now, in this last instant, you and your friend stand together, illuminated by the curious glow of that unusual fire, cocooned in the gentle hum of other voices, at peace in the heart of this mysterious gathering.
