You sit at a desk that slowly sinks into sand. The written test before you keeps rewriting its own questions. "Where do you see yourself in five years?" becomes "Where do you see your shadows when the light forgets you?" Your pen leaks not ink, but the sound of your childhood laughter. Each answer you write floats off the page and becomes a moth, circling a lamp that pulses like a heartbeat.

The interview round is held in a room with mirrors for walls. Each reflection interviews you simultaneously, but they're all different versions of who you might become: one is old and gentle, one is sharp with regret, one is hollow-eyed from success, one is laughing at something you haven't understood yet. They ask only one question in unison: "Would you still want this if no one was watching?" You notice your answer is written on the back of your hand in a language you're just now remembering how to speak.

For the practical challenge, you're given a clock that's melting and told to "fix time." You discover the gears are made of memories—someone's first love, someone's last goodbye. When you try to adjust them, you hear your own voice from years ago saying things you wish you hadn't. The key isn't to repair it, but to accept the way it warps.

The final trial is a simple coffee meeting with the CEO, who has your face but older. They slide a contract across the table. The fine print reads, "This job will kill who you are now. Sign with your blood or your tears—your choice." Outside the window, you see all your competitors have turned into trees, roots deep in the earth, growing patiently.

You realize you were never competing against them. The ink-stained moths gather around your hand. The mirrors all smile. The clock begins to chime in reverse.

The job, you now understand, is to keep dreaming.
