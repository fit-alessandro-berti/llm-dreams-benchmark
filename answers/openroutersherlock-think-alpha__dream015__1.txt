You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to rally a band of misfit survivors— a grizzled mechanic with a cybernetic arm, a sharp-eyed scavenger girl who whispers to the wind, and a hulking mutant who hums forgotten lullabies—and set out for the fabled Oasis of Echoes, a shimmering mirage-city said to rebuild itself from dreams.

The journey twists through crimson dunes where rusted skyscrapers float like ghosts, defying gravity. Raiders on biomechanical wolves charge from sandstorms, but you improvise a trap with jury-rigged EMP grenades, turning their rides into stumbling statues. At night, under a sky fractured like stained glass, the group shares stories around a fire of glowing fungi; the scavenger girl reveals she can glimpse futures in puddles, and yours shows you crowned in vines, king of a verdant rebirth.

Deeper in, the ruins pulse with bioluminescent veins, whispering temptations: "Stay, rule eternally." You resist, pressing on until the horizon warps. The Oasis reveals itself—not a city, but a colossal tree-heart, roots drinking radiation, leaves weaving homes from pure light. Your band plants the first seeds, and as vines coil around you in embrace, the world blooms.

But then the dream fractures—colors bleed into static, the tree whispers your real name, and you jolt awake, heart pounding, the faint scent of earth lingering on your skin. What happens next in the dream? You decide.
