...you hesitate for just a heartbeat—instinct warring with instinct. The city’s roar presses in: honking taxis, distant sirens, the chatter of a hundred lives brushing past without noticing yours. But their eyes hold no guile, only warmth. An older woman with silver-streaked hair offers a hand; her palm is lined like a map of gentle roads. A young man with paint-stained fingers nods toward a narrow alleyway veiled in wisteria. "This way," he says, voice soft as worn velvet. "The city shows its true paths only to those who ask."

You step forward, and the alley swallows you whole. But instead of brick and grime, you find yourself walking along the spine of a sleeping dragon, its scales shimmering like wet pavement under streetlights. The strangers walk beside you, their footsteps echoing like piano keys. The woman hums a lullaby you haven’t heard since childhood. The air smells of rain and old paper.

Then you remember: you weren’t lost. You were waiting.  
And the dream folds you into its arms like a letter finally delivered home.
