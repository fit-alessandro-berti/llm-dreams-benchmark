written in a language you don't understand. Panic starts to set in as you try to decipher the strange symbols and unfamiliar script. The room begins to feel smaller, the walls closing in, and the ticking of the clock on the wall grows louder and more relentless.

Suddenly, you realize a peculiar thing: the text on the paper starts to shift and rearrange itself into words you recognize. However, the questions now seem impossibly complex, a mix of abstract puzzles and scenarios that don't relate to anything you studied.

Then, out of nowhere, you hear a soft whispering and realize it's coming from the other students around you. They seem to be sharing answers through a series of coded glances and subtle hand signals. You feel torn between joining in their covert communication and the nagging sense of guilt about cheating.

As you contemplate what to do, the room morphs. The walls are now made of glass, and outside you see scenes from your future career flashing by like a movie reel. Each scene alters based on the choices you make on the exam. One moment shows you succeeding in a bustling, vibrant environment, while the next shows you struggling in a monotonous, dimly-lit office.

Just then, your instructor, who now looks more like a wise sage, walks over to your desk. He places his hand on your shoulder and says, "Remember, this exam is not about what you know, but who you are."

You take a deep breath, look down at the exam, and this time, the questions seem different. They ask about your aspirations, values, and what you truly enjoy doing. A sense of calm washes over you as you begin to write from the heart.

The dream starts to fade, but you awaken with a sense of clarity and purpose. Somehow, you know that no matter what, you'll be okay.
