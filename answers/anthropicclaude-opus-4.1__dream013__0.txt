...notice the walls beginning to shift and breathe like living tissue. The geometric patterns on them start to solve themselves, equations flowing like water across the surfaces. You reach for a puzzle cube floating in midair, but your hands pass through it like mist.

Suddenly you're not walking but gliding, and the maze has become infinite library corridors where books whisper their contents directly into your mind. The logical rules you were following dissolve - a door requires you to forget its existence to open it, and you somehow understand this makes perfect sense.

The final puzzle is a mirror showing not your reflection, but all the choices you didn't make, spreading out like tree branches into infinite possible mazes.

You wake up. Or do you? The maze is gone but you're still holding the echo of that liquid key, and somewhere in the back of your mind, you know the answer about Wednesday's color was important...
