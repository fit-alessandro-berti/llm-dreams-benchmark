You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to find a way back home. You wander through the unfamiliar terrain, and after many trials, you stumble upon a mysterious artifact that glows with an otherworldly light. As you touch it, a surge of energy washes over you, and suddenly, you're back in your own bed, the dream fading like mist. You lie there, heart pounding, wondering if it was all just a figment of your imagination—or something more.
