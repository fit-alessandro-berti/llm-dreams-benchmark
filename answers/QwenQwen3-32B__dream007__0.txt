You decide to step outside, the air thick with the weight of unspoken words. As you walk, the streetlights flicker and elongate into towering, willow-like trees with glowing, glass bulbs for leaves. Your friend follows, their footsteps muffled, as if the ground itself is absorbing the tension. The path ahead splits into two: one paved with smooth, polished mirrors reflecting your face but no one else’s, the other a winding trail of cracked porcelain, each fragment shimmering with fragments of past memories—shared laughter, silent hurt, moments you’d both rather forget.  

You pause, and your friend speaks, their voice echoing as if from a distance. “We’re both walking the same cracks,” they say, stepping onto the porcelain path. The pieces beneath their feet glow faintly, revealing hidden inscriptions—half-formed apologies, unfinished jokes, the things you’d both left unsaid. You follow, and with each step, the fragments shift, rearranging into a bridge that spans a chasm you hadn’t noticed before. Below, a river of liquid shadow swirls, whispering the argument in both your voices, twisted and distorted.  

At the center of the bridge, you turn to face each other. Your friend’s outline wavers, morphing briefly into people you’ve known but never fully understood—their past, their fears, the quiet sacrifices they’ve made. You feel your own edges blur, too, and in that moment of vulnerability, the bridge stabilizes, the porcelain smoothing into glass. You both lean down, pressing your palms to it, and the surface ripples like water, showing not the chasm below, but a shared horizon—a sunlit field where the argument dissolves into the wind.  

When you wake, the dream lingers: the argument isn’t over, but the path forward is clearer, paved with the fragile, beautiful truth that some cracks can hold you both, if you learn to step carefully.
