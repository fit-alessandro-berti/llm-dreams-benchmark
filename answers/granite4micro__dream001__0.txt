wake up.

As soon as your eyes open, you feel disoriented and confused. The realization hits you that you urgently need to be at the location of your important meeting within the next hour. However, you are completely lost in this strange city, surrounded by towering skyscrapers, winding streets, and unfamiliar landmarks.

You take a deep breath and try to remember any clues or hints about where the meeting might be taking place. You mentally review your itinerary, searching for any addresses or details that could guide you. Unfortunately, nothing comes to mind.

Feeling panicked but determined, you start walking down the nearest street, hoping it leads somewhere useful. As you walk, you notice a few signs in different languages and a mix of accents when people pass by. You quickly realize how disconnected from your own culture this city must be.

The streets become busier as you venture deeper into the heart of the city. You spot an old library with books in languages unfamiliar to you. It seems like an important landmark, but it doesn't look like a place where meetings are conducted.

Deciding to seek help, you find your way to the entrance and approach the desk. The librarian appears friendly and speaks slowly, trying to communicate using both words and gestures. You share that you urgently need directions to a specific meeting spot and emphasize how much time is running out.

The librarian seems hesitant at first but eventually helps you by providing crucial information:

1. Head northeast towards the central marketplace.
2. Turn left at the old fountain and follow it for about 200 meters.
3. Take the third exit on your right, which leads to a narrow alleyway.
4. The meeting is in a small, dimly lit room on the second floor.

Your heart races with excitement yet anxiety as you follow each direction meticulously. Finally, after what feels like ages, you find yourself standing outside a peculiar-looking building adorned with intricate architecture and colorful mosaic tiles.

With your breath held, you enter the building, turn around to confirm that it's indeed in the right place, spot familiar belongings (your jacket or keys), and rush up to the second floor. Just as the clock on the wall ticks past midnight, you locate the room where the meeting is set to take place.

The realization hits you: all this confusion and frantic searching have led you exactly where needed. You stand in your very own office, surrounded by colleagues eager for the important discussion ahead. The city outside represents chaos and uncertainty, while the professional environment within the building symbolizes serenity, collaboration, and growth.

As you take a moment to compose yourself before entering the meeting room with everyone else around you, know that sometimes getting lost in unfamiliar terrain can lead us unexpectedly closer to where we truly need to be.
