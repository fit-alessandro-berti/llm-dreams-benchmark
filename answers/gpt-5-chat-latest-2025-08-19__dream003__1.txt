…the patterns seem to shift and ripple as though they’re alive, subtly rearranging themselves each time you blink. At first they resemble vines curling across the surface, but then they transform into constellations, and finally into unfamiliar script that feels both ancient and personal, as though written for you alone.  

When you trace a finger along the carvings, the box emits a faint warmth. A soft hum resonates from within, and suddenly the lid loosens—though it does not yet open. Instead, the patterns converge into a symbol that hovers in the air just above the box.  

The symbol pulses with light, and in that glow you see fleeting images: a forest bathed in silver mist, a winding path leading to an archway of stone, and beyond it, something waiting—something that feels like both a question and an answer.  

You realize the box is less a container and more a door, but it will only reveal what’s inside when you’re ready to step into that vision.  

Do you want to open the lid now, or follow the vision into the misted forest?
