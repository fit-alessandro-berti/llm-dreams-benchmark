You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel a cold sweat on your forehead. The clock is already ticking—only 24 hours until the presentation. You glance at the stack of paperwork on your desk, but it's not paper. It's floating in midair, glowing faintly, as if it's alive. 

Your colleagues are frozen in place, their faces blank, like they're trapped in some kind of dream too. You try to speak, but your voice comes out as a whisper, and no one reacts. Then, from the corner of your eye, you see a door that wasn't there before—a small, wooden door, slightly ajar, with a faint light spilling out.

You walk toward it, unsure if you're dreaming or if this is real. As you open the door, you step into a vast, endless library. Shelves stretch into infinity, filled with books that seem to hum with energy. Each book is labeled with your name, but the titles are strange: *The Art of Time Traveling Without Aging*, *How to Speak to the Future*, *The Secret History of Your Dreams*.

A figure appears—your childhood self, smiling knowingly. "You’re here because you need to choose," they say. "You can either finish the project by any means necessary, or you can learn something that will change everything."

You feel the weight of the decision pressing down on you. Behind you, the clock ticks louder. In front of you, the library waits. What do you do?
