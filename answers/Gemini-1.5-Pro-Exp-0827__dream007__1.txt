...decide to walk away. The words catch in my throat, a bitter mix of anger and hurt.  The cafe, bustling moments ago with the chatter of patrons, suddenly feels silent, the air thick with unspoken words. I push back my chair, the scraping sound echoing unnaturally loud, and turn away from my friend, their face a mask of disbelief and pain. 

I walk out into the blinding sunlight, the street shimmering with heat. My heart pounds in my chest, a frantic drumbeat against my ribs. The anger is a burning ember inside me, but beneath it, a cold dread starts to spread.  This is more than an argument; this feels like a fracture, a deep crack appearing in the foundation of our friendship. 

I wander aimlessly, the familiar streets suddenly foreign and unsettling.  The faces of strangers blur past, their voices a meaningless murmur.  My phone vibrates in my pocket, but I ignore it.  Itâ€™s probably them, wanting to talk, wanting to apologize, wanting to fix it.  But I'm not ready.  I need space, I need time to process the hurt, the betrayal, the feeling that maybe, just maybe, we don't know each other as well as we thought we did.

Suddenly, the ground beneath me starts to tremble. The buildings around me sway, their windows shattering like fragile ice.  The sky above darkens, the sun blotted out by a swirling mass of black clouds.  Panic grips me, a cold fist clenching around my heart.  This isn't just a fight with a friend anymore; this is something bigger, something terrifying.  And in the midst of the chaos, I realize with a sickening certainty that I'm completely alone.  

I turn back, searching for the cafe, for my friend, for any semblance of familiarity. But the street is empty, the buildings reduced to rubble.  The only sound is the wind, howling like a mournful beast.  And then, I wake up.
