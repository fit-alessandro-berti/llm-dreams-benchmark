### The Dream Continues

You zigzag through the bustling crowd, the air thick with laughter, clinking glasses, and the scent of hors d'oeuvres. Your eyes scan frantically for that familiar face—the only one you recognize in this sea of strangers. Suddenly, you stumble into a cluster of bespectacled academics debating quantum physics at a cocktail party. "Entanglement is just a fancy way of saying 'we're all connected,'" one insists, while another counters, "No, it's a metaphor for bad Wi-Fi." They turn to you, inviting opinions, but you politely nod and slip away, still searching.

Next, you nearly bump into a group of acrobats practicing flips and juggles in the middle of the dance floor. Feathers from their costumes tickle your nose as they shout encouragements like, "Fly, don't fall!" Spotting a chance to blend in, you mimic a clumsy cartwheel, earning applause—and a fleeting high-five from a performer with glowing neon shoes. But your mystery friend isn't among them.

As the music shifts to a haunting waltz, you find yourself in a circle of fortune tellers huddled around a crystal ball, predicting absurd futures. "You'll invent a self-cleaning cat," one proclaims, gazing at you intensely. Another chuckles, "Or maybe just lose your keys for the third time today." Perplexed but entertained, you ask if the ball can locate a single person in a crowd. They chant melodically, the ball swirling with mist, and suddenly it reveals a vision: your known acquaintance standing by the buffet table, piling plates with mini quiches.

### The Twist

Heart racing, you rush toward them, but as you approach, the tables vanish, the people morph into shadows, and the room stretches into infinity. You wake with a start, the dream's logic unraveling like a cheap sweater. Was it a metaphor for feeling lost in society—or just your brain processing too much social anxiety? Either way, it's over now, but hey, at least you dodged the acrobats. Sweet dreams for next time?
