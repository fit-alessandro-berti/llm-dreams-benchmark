# The Dream Competition

You are participating in a competition where the grand prize is your dream job. As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and...

...the first one materializes around me like wet paint bleeding across a canvas. I'm standing in an enormous amphitheater, but the seats are filled with every person I've ever disappointed — old teachers, former friends, strangers whose eyes somehow carry the weight of familiarity. A voice with no source announces:

**"Round One: The Impossible Question."**

A single question appears burning in the air: *"What are you actually good at?"*

My mouth opens, but the words come out as butterflies — black monarchs that scatter uselessly. The audience begins slow-clapping. But then I realize — I don't need to *say* it. I start **doing** things instead. Building something with my hands. The butterflies return, forming sentences in the air. The audience goes quiet. A bell rings.

**"Round Two: The Hallway."**

I'm in a corridor that stretches infinitely, lined with doors. Behind each one is a version of my life I didn't choose. I can hear laughter behind some. Crying behind others. The challenge is to keep walking forward *without opening any of them*. My hand reaches for a handle — the one marked "Safe Choice" — and I have to physically pull my own arm back. My feet feel like they're walking through honey.

**"Round Three: The Mirror Stage."**

I face my competitor. It's... me. But sharper. More confident. Better-dressed. They smirk and say, *"You know I'm what they actually want, right?"*

We're told to build something — anything — that represents why we deserve this. The other me constructs a flawless glass tower, pristine and impressive. I build something crooked, strange, held together with visible seams and fingerprints. The judges lean forward.

The glass tower catches the light beautifully.

Mine catches the light **and bends it into something no one's seen before.**

**"Final Round."**

The voice asks simply: *"Why do you want this?"*

And for once, the honest answer isn't impressive. It's small and trembling: *"Because I think I could actually be good at it. And that terrifies me."*

The amphitheater dissolves. The job doesn't arrive as a trophy or a contract. It arrives as a door — unlocked, ordinary, slightly ajar — and the dream ends just as my hand touches it, right at that breathless moment where possibility still feels infinite—

*And then, of course, the alarm goes off.*
