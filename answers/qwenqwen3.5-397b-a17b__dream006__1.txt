speak, but the microphone dissolves into warm sand in your hand. You aren't alarmed. In fact, you feel a strange, buoyant lightness. You open your mouth to continue, but instead of sound, a flock of iridescent blue moths flutters out from between your lips.

They circle the auditorium, and as they pass over the audience, the people's faces blur and shift. Some become animals—a row of owls in the front, a cluster of foxes in the balcony. Others become empty chairs draped in velvet. You realize you are not giving a speech, but conducting a transformation.

The stage beneath your feet tilts gently, like the deck of a ship on a calm sea. You slide not down, but *up*, gravity reversing as you float toward the rafters. The moths return to you, landing on your shoulders and eyelids, heavy and soft. The audience rises as one, not to cheer, but to breathe in unison, a sound like wind rushing through pine trees.

You reach out to touch the spotlight above, and it feels like cool water. As your fingers break the surface of the light, the auditorium fills with the ocean, and you take a breath that tastes of salt and morning coffee. The water rises to your chin, your lips, your nose, and just as you submerge completely, you wake up with the taste of salt on your tongue and the sound of rain tapping against your window.
