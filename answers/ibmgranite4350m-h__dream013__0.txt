The walls of the maze become increasingly narrow and your path becomes more challenging. At times it feels like time is losing meaning as the maze grows denser and more intricate. You feel a sense of anxiety growing with each step leading to this mysterious reality.

As you navigate through the maze's twists, turns, and dead ends, complex puzzles begin to appear, requiring even greater concentration and logical thinking from your perspective. Every decision made within these puzzles brings further difficulty as the path becomes more unpredictable but also perhaps more rewarding in its own way.

You are left with a sense of accomplishment for solving them all while staying aware that you may never truly return home or understand how deeper into this maze one must go to find what is waiting at the end.
