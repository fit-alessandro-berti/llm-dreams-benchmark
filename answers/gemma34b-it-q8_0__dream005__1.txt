...strange little pockets of conversation swirling within them. They weren’t *arguido*, not really. More like fragments – snippets of half-formed ideas, complaints about weather, detailed histories of obscure pastries. I felt immediately overwhelmed and desperately wished desperately – absurdly, for a single name.

I pushed my way through a circle of men in pinstriper suits holding miniature chess pieces and arguing about the optimal distribution of squares for an island nation. They glanced up at me with polite, mildly unnerved stares before resuming their animated discussion. Then I nearly tripped over a woman completely absorbed in arranging a collection of iridescent feathers. She didn’t see me; I risked a small smile as she uttered, “Imagine scaling the rainbow with these!” in a reverious drone. 

Behind her, further down a narrow hall lined with velvet ropes, I caught another group.  All dressed in elaborate, feathered headdresses, they were debating the theological merits of synchronized dolphin calls. One woman insisted they proved a benevolent, aquatic god, while another vehemently countered it indicated primal territorial aggression. The logic, if you could call it that, felt completely detached from the rest of the world.

I started to feel a growing panic. Time was distorting. A doorway shimmered then vanished, replacing it with a hallway filled with portraits of cats wearing tiny, unsettlingly knowing expressions.  Each portrait subtly shifted and tilted, like they were judging me silently.  The background music, previously muffled chatter, escalated into this manic harpsichord melody.  

Just around the corner, bathed faintly in the golden light of a nonexistent chandelier, I saw *him*. A tall man with kind eyes and a perpetually slightly bewildered expression. He was talking to...a garden gnome? Really, a small terracotta gnome holding a monocle.

And then, suddenly, the music warped into something else entirely – the sound of pouring honey thick and viscous as a dream - and as I started toward him, the whole gathering dissolved into a shimmering waterfall of violet silk...

...and I woke up, remembering exactly who I was, and the strangely specific request I had before I went to bed. It was a list for ordering replacement buttons. Seriously.
