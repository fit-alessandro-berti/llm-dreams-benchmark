The ship groans beneath you, its timbers shuddering like a creature in pain. Rain lashes sideways, blinding your eyes, and the wind screams like a dying thing. The deck tilts beneath your boots—*hard*—and your stomach lurches with it.

Your crew’s faces blur in the storm’s fury. Young. Old. Some you’ve known for years. Others, only weeks. Their eyes—wide, scared—lock onto you like you’re the last solid thing left in a world cracking open.

You don’t shout. You don’t curse. You breathe.

And then you move.

Not fast. Not wild. Just *sure*. Each step deliberate, hand steady on the wheel as the ship bucks like a wild horse. You feel the storm, yes—but more than that, you feel *her*: the ship. Her moods, her limits. You’ve danced with her a thousand nights like this, and she’s never let you fall.

You lean into the wheel, just enough. Not too much. The rudder answers with a groan.

“Ease the sails,” you tell them, voice low but certain. “Now.”

Hands scramble. Tension loosens. Someone coughs. Another breathes.

You glance at the horizon. Not much but the black seam where sky meets sea. No land. No comfort. Just the storm and the choice you’ve made: to stay with the ship, and with them, until it passes or you don’t.

So you stand.

You ride.

And you wait.
