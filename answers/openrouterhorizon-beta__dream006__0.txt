…speak, but the first word leaves your mouth as a flock of birds. They flutter up toward the rafters, scattering into the lights like scraps of paper catching fire, and the audience leans forward as if to catch them. You clear your throat and try again. This time your voice arrives as warm rain. It patters across the front row, beading on lapels, slicking back hair, and the people begin to nod as if this is exactly what they came for.

You look down at your notes and they are not notes anymore but a small lake held in your hands, cupped perfectly by the paper. When you tilt it toward the microphone, ripples run out across the stage and become sentences that drift through the room. Each sentence is a small boat. You watch them find listeners—anchoring softly in their ears, unloading cargo: stories, apologies, the names of things you forgot you knew.

Someone coughs and the sound blooms into a field of dandelions. A baby laughs and windows open along the back wall, letting in a wind that smells like oranges and pencil shavings and old summer lawns. You feel your fear as a jacket slung over your shoulders. It is heavy for the first few minutes, then surprisingly comfortable, then you realize you can slip it off, and when you do the jacket walks away on its own and sits in an empty seat and listens politely.

You are saying something important now, you can tell because the floorboards have turned to water and the podium has become a pier and your feet are bare, the wood warm, the crowd a harbor full of listening faces, the lights above you like friendly moons. You don’t remember writing these words, but you recognize them the way you recognize your own handwriting in a place you never remember visiting. You speak about how every door you’ve ever walked through is still swinging somewhere, how each goodbye is a kitchen light left on in case you come back. You tell them that all the questions you carry have been nesting under your ribs, hatching into birds that need you to name them so they can leave.

As you say this, the ceiling lifts, or perhaps your head does, and the room grows taller than architecture. The audience stands, not because you are finished but because they are rising like bread, expanding with heat and breath and attention. You can see their thoughts like constellations stitched just above their hair, connected by thin white lines, and you understand suddenly that you are not here to impress them but to hold a mirror steady while they find their own faces in it.

You reach for your glass of water and it is the ocean. You sip anyway. Salt, thunder, shells rolling softly over your tongue. The microphone becomes a seashell too, and when you press your mouth to it you hear the crowd’s tide moving in and out, a thousand small currents, a thousand shores. You tell them the secret you didn’t know you’d brought: that you are not separate from them, that every story you’ve ever told is just a ladder they already had, painted a color they forgot they liked.

Someone in the back begins to cry and it sounds like the first time a violin figures out what it’s for. Laughter arrives and braids itself into the weeping until the two are indistinguishable, a rope strong enough to climb. You invite them to climb it with you. Many do. Hands catch hands. You realize the stage is a hill and the hill is a chest and the chest is your own, rising and falling, and the auditorium is inside you, and you are inside it, like a word inside its meaning.

When you reach the last line—the one that wasn’t there when you started—your mouth shapes it before you hear it. It is simple. Thank you for listening to yourselves. It lands gently in the center of the room and opens like a seed. The lights dim as if to give it darkness to root in. For a moment everything holds its breath.

Then the birds in the rafters settle back on your tongue, and you taste feathers and sky, and you realize you have been dreaming the whole time. But even as you wake, their wings beat once more, and the room, the boats, the jackets, the oranges, the harbors—they fold and tuck themselves into your chest, small and warm, where they will be waiting the next time you step on a stage and begin to speak.
