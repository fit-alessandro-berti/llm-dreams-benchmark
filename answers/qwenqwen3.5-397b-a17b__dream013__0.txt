notice the walls begin to breathe. The sharp angles of the corridors soften into curves, and the numbers etched into the stone start to drift away like leaves on a stream, dissolving before you can memorize them. The logic you relied on grows heavy in your hands, turning into something fluid and intuitive. 

You reach for a key hidden within a riddle, but when your fingers touch it, it shatters into a flock of moths that flutter upward into a ceiling that no longer exists. Above you, there is only a sky made of velvet and ticking clock faces, their hands spinning backward. You realize you are no longer walking; you are floating, carried by the current of the maze itself. The puzzles stop asking for answers and start humming melodies you remember from childhood. 

At the center, there is no treasure, only a mirror standing alone in a field of tall, silver grass. When you look into it, there is no reflection, only a door handle made of light. You turn it, and the maze unfolds like a paper origami bird, releasing you into the quiet, white silence of morning.
