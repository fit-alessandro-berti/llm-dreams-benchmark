You’re walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the world shifts around you—trees snap at the wind, leaves scream in the air, and the sky blazes with ominous clouds. The air grows heavy, and the ground beneath your feet trembles like it’s about to swallow you whole.  

You clutch your jacket, heart pounding, as the wind howls through the trees, scattering leaves in spirals. The ground beneath you quivers, and the sound of thunder echoes like a haunting melody. A chill seeps into your bones, and the distant scent of rain fills the air. The storm isn’t just coming—it’s *awakening* you.  

Then, the forest itself seems to breathe. Roots twist and writhe, and the trees bend forward, their branches craning to catch the storm’s fury. You realize you’re not just fleeing—*you’re part of it*. The wind lifts your hair, and for a moment, you’re suspended in the chaos, alive and vulnerable, your thoughts racing.  

In the heart of the storm, a flicker of light breaks through the chaos. It’s not a fire, but a glimmer of silver, like a shard of something ancient. The light draws you forward, and as you follow, the storm becomes a canvas. You glimpse a path carved into the earth, leading to a cavern where the light pools, casting long shadows.  

The storm is not just a force—it’s a guide. And as the thunder roars, you feel a strange certainty: the forest will hold you, and the storm will shape you. You’ll emerge changed, weathered, and perhaps wiser.  

*(The dream ends with the storm settling, leaving behind a lingering sense of mystery and transformation.)*
