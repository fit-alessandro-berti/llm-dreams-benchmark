You're right in the middle of an unfamiliar place. The air smells different—woodsmoke, earth, maybe some kind of herb. You're wearing clothes that aren't yours, and when you look down, your hands seem... older? Or maybe just weathered.

You hear voices nearby—laughter, the clatter of metal, what sounds like a marketplace. The sun is high, and the architecture around you is made of stone and timber. No wires, no screens, no engines.

You need to **find a way to understand where and when you are**—and quickly, before someone notices you don't belong.

A vendor across the narrow street glances your way. A child runs past laughing. Somewhere, a bell rings.

**What do you do?** Do you approach someone? Observe first? Try to find a quiet corner to gather your thoughts?

The dream is yours to shape—where does it go?
