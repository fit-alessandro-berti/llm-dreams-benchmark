…keep moving.  
The cracked highway at your feet unfurls like a gray ribbon toward the horizon, its faded lane markings shimmering in the heat haze. On your back is a battered canvas pack that rattles with the last three glass marbles you salvaged from a ruined toy shop—currency in a world where metal and plastic have become almost mythical. In your pocket rests a torn page from an astronomy book, its ink-smudged diagram of the constellations guiding you west each night when the clouds part.

A distant rumble shakes the air. You duck behind an overturned bus just as a convoy of scavenger bikes buzzes past, headlights flickering like fireflies. Their riders wear mismatched helmets decorated with bottle-cap mosaics, and they shout coded whistles that echo across the silent overpass. You wait until the sound fades, pulse pounding, before emerging.

Despite the fear, you decide to follow them—from a distance. Rumor says the bikers have mapped a hidden greenhouse, a place where seeds germinate in repurposed light bulbs and vines coil up the ribs of an old radio tower. Food, water, maybe even real soil: enough to keep a future alive. You tell yourself you are not chasing a myth; you are hunting a possibility.

As dusk settles, the sky bruises purple. You reach the edge of the long-abandoned suburbs where the convoy’s tracks vanish into an overgrown cul-de-sac. Here, houses sag like tired giants, but one still burns a faint light. Curiosity wins over caution. You slip through a yawning crack in the fence and step onto a lawn furred with dandelions.

Inside, candle glow reveals a patchwork commune: half a dozen survivors, young and old, seated at a table fashioned from a garage door. A kettle steams on a makeshift stove powered by bicycle generators. They glance up—startled, but not hostile. A wiry woman with copper coils in her hair gestures to an empty chair.  
“Lost?” she asks.  

You nod. She pours murky tea into a chipped mug and slides it to you. The fragrance is impossibly sweet, mingling rose hips and something like hope. With the first sip, warmth spreads through your ribcage, thawing months of cold.

Conversation trickles, then flows. They speak of the greenhouse—real, not legend—and of a plan to reclaim the river valley using solar stills and salvaged irrigation pipe. They need another pair of hands to haul materials, to keep watch, to dream alongside them. You listen, heart quickening: for the first time the future feels less like a wasteland and more like a seed awaiting water.

Night deepens, and the commune beds down. You unroll your blanket near an open window where crickets chirp. Moonlight sketches silver lines on the floorboards; distant thunder hints at rain that might wash the dust from tomorrow. As your eyelids grow heavy, you decide—not merely to survive, but to build.

In the hush before sleep inside this dream, you whisper to yourself:  
“The world ended. Let’s begin.”
