...follow them through winding alleyways that seem to shift and breathe around you. The strangers' faces keep changing—sometimes they're old friends you haven't seen in years, sometimes complete unknowns with eyes full of starlight. 

As you walk together, the city begins to transform. The concrete softens into moss-covered paths, and the towering buildings slowly morph into ancient trees whose branches stretch impossibly high into a sky that's somehow both day and night at once. Street lamps become glowing flowers, and the sound of traffic fades into the gentle murmur of a distant stream.

One of the strangers—now wearing your grandmother's smile—places a warm hand on your shoulder and points ahead. There, nestled between the roots of the largest tree, is a doorway that looks exactly like the entrance to your childhood home. But when you step through it, you find yourself not inside a house, but standing on a hill overlooking the entire dream-city below, now glowing softly like a constellation that has fallen to earth.

You realize you were never truly lost—you were exactly where you needed to be, and the strangers were all parts of yourself, guiding you home to a place you'd forgotten you knew. The feeling of being alone dissolves like morning mist, replaced by a deep sense of connection to everything around you.
