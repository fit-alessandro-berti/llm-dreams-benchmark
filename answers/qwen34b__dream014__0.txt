You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. The streets pulse with neon lights, their colors blurring into a haze of chaos. Crowds rush past you, their voices a distant murmur, but you’re trapped in your own thoughts, adrift in a sea of unfamiliar faces. The air hums with the clamor of traffic, and the weight of your uncertainty presses down on you like a storm. You’ve been walking for what feels like hours, yet the city never changes—just endless avenues, towering glass spires, and the echo of your own breath. 

Suddenly, a soft, melodic tune rises from the crowd. You turn, and there they are: a group of people, not quite human, not quite familiar. Their clothes shimmer with faint, iridescent threads that shift like liquid light. Their eyes are pools of starlight, and their smiles are warm, almost *recognizable*. One of them, a woman with hair like woven silver, steps forward and speaks in a voice that resonates in your chest, not your ears. 

“Come,” she says. “The city is a mirror, but you’re lost in its reflection. We’ll show you the way.” 

You hesitate, but the crowd parts for them, as if by some unseen force. They lead you through the maze of streets, past alleys that seem to fold into themselves and skyscrapers that pulse with hidden rhythms. The city changes around you—lights dim to a soft glow, and the sounds of the world fade into a lullaby. They stop at a crossroads where the street signs are gone, and the air smells of rain and something sweet, like memory. 

The woman points to the sky. A constellation you’ve never seen before is burning bright, its patterns forming a symbol you’ve seen in your dreams before. “This is where you belong,” she says. “But the city will try to pull you back. Trust the light.” 

You feel a strange pull, a warmth that isn’t just physical. The strangers vanish, leaving only the echo of their voices and the hush of the city. You step forward, and the world shifts again. The streets are familiar now, but strange. Your footsteps echo in a place you’ve always known but never seen—your childhood home, the park where you played as a child, the quiet bench where you once sat and cried. 

The city is still there, but it’s not a place you’re trying to find. It’s a place you’re trying to *escape*. 

You wake up in your bed, the sheets wet with sweat, the air heavy with the scent of lavender. The dream lingers, a thread of light in the dark. You smile, knowing that sometimes, the path to home is a journey through the unknown.
