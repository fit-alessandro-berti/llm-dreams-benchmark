search for directions, but your phone is dead, and the city feels strangely fluid, with streets shifting and twisting like a living maze. The towering skyscrapers seem to loom closer with every step you take, their windows reflecting distorted versions of the bustling crowds around you. You try to ask someone for help, but as you approach them, their features blur, and their words sound like echoes in a tunnel.

Frustrated, you turn down a narrow alley, hoping for a shortcut. Suddenly, the alley transforms into a long corridor lined with doors, each marked with a single cryptic symbol glowing faintly in the dim light. You feel a pull toward one particular door—a swirling golden spiral etched into the wood. One part of you hesitates, though, as you sense that opening it will change everything.

With no other options, you push the door open. On the other side is a room unlike anything you've ever seen, filled with clocks that tick at different speeds and directions. A calm but mysterious figure stands in the center, wearing a suit that shifts in color as they move. They look at you and say, "You’re not late... yet. But you’ll need to answer a question to find your way."

The figure smiles faintly and asks, "What is it you’re truly searching for?"
