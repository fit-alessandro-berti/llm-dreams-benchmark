take a step back and breathe deeply, recognizing that emotions are running high and that it's important to approach the situation calmly. You tell your friend that you value their perspective and suggest taking a short break to cool down before continuing the conversation.

After a few minutes, you both reconvene and express your thoughts and feelings with more clarity. You listen attentively to your friend's points and try to find common ground. As the discussion progresses, you realize that while you may not agree on everything, your friendship is strong enough to withstand disagreements.

In the dream, you wake up feeling relieved that you managed to resolve the conflict in a respectful and constructive manner, and you appreciate the depth of your connection with your friend even more.
