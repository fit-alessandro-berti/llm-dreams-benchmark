### **Dream Continuation: A Journey Through the Ashes**

You find yourself in a **post-apocalyptic world**, where the sky is a perpetual gray, choked with ash from distant fires. Towers of rusted steel and crumbling concrete loom like broken teeth over a landscape that was once a bustling city. The air tastes metallic, thick with dust, and the silence is broken only by the occasional creak of collapsing structures or the distant howl of something unseen.

Resources are scarce. What little water remains is brackish and guarded by factions who would kill as soon as look at you. Food is a memory, preserved rations hard as stone, or the scavenging of rats and insects that have grown strangely large and mutaded. But despite the hardships—despite the gnawing hunger in your gut and the constant fear whispering behind your eyes—you decide to **journey alone into the Wastes of the Forgotten.**

---

You pack only what you can carry in a worn leather satchel: a rusted blade, a canteen half-filled with murky water, a tattered map drawn on scrap paper, and a single vial of medicine—your only hope if the radiation sickness takes hold. Your face is wrapped in a cloth to filter the dust. You wear boots that are falling apart, but you walk.

The silence feels alive. It presses in on you like water. Every shadow could hide a predator. Every creak of metal could be a trap.

You reach an old highway, now overgrown with twisted vines and brittle weeds. The road is littered with the wrecks of cars, some burnt, some still carrying skeletons in the seats. You pause at one, searching through the remains for anything of value. In the glove box, you find a photograph—faded, cracked—of a child smiling in front of a tree that no longer exists.

You slip it into your pocket, not for sentiment, but because it reminds you *why* you’re doing this. You’re not just surviving—you’re searching for something more. A rumored sanctuary, spoken of only in whispers around fires: **The Green Glen.**

It’s said to be a place where the land still bears life. Where clean water flows, and children grow up without fear. It’s supposed to be hidden deep in the mountains, guarded by those who found it first. But you have no choice. The world above is dying. If there is any hope left, it lies there.

Days pass. You avoid patrols of the Iron Jackals—ruthless scavengers who rule the northern Wastes with iron fists and electrified fences. You cross poisoned rivers, sleep under the bones of skyscrapers, and drink from puddles that might kill you just as surely as any bandit.

One night, you stumble into a ruined underground subway station. The lights flicker on occasionally, powered by some mysterious energy source buried deep below. You find a terminal still humming with life. With trembling fingers, you tap it.

A message loads.

> “**If you read this, you are close. Follow the green marker. Trust no one. The path is not safe. Sanctuary awaits.**”

You scan the room. In the dim glow of the screen, you spot it: a faded green X painted on the wall behind a pile of rubble. Behind it, a rusted maintenance door, half-buried. You shove it open.

Beyond is darkness. Cold air rushes out, carrying the scent of pine.

You steel yourself. You grab your blade, your canteen, and follow the green markers carved into the walls, deeper into the earth.

---

You descend into a forgotten tunnel network—once built for transport, now transformed into a hidden artery leading somewhere unknown. The deeper you go, the cleaner the air becomes. Strange glowing lichen cling to the walls, casting an eerie green light.

After hours of walking, you hear it: the sound of flowing water.

You emerge into a cavern. Moonlight filters down through cracks in the ceiling, illuminating a hidden valley suspended in stone. Trees grow lush and green. A small river winds through emerald grass. People—survivors—live in simple homes made from salvaged wood and stone. Children play. A flag flies: a green pine on a white background.

You’ve found it.

The Sanctuary.

A woman with gray-streaked hair and eyes like steel approaches you. She wears a patch on her sleeve—a pine tree inside a circle.

“You're not from around here,” she says, voice cautious but not unfriendly.

You nod. You show her the photograph. You tell her what you’ve seen. You ask, “Is this real? Or just another dream?”

She smiles faintly. “It’s real. But dreams are what keep us going. And now, you’re part of that dream.”

You breathe. The first clean breath in years.

And for the first time, you allow yourself to hope.
