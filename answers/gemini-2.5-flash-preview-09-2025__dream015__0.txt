...Despite the hardships, you decide to **pursue the myth of the Last Sound.**

The world you inhabit is a monochrome canvas of ash and iron, where the only reliable noise is the wind whistling through hollowed-out skyscrapers that resemble skeletal monuments to hubris. But the whispers you’ve caught among the other silent, desperate survivors speak of a place untouched by the great silencing—a hidden valley or perhaps just a collective hallucination—where the sound of running water or even a human voice still resonates naturally.

You set out immediately, driven not by logic, but by the aching silence pressing against your eardrums.

The ground under your boots is not stable earth, but shifting layers of pulverized glass that crunch like frozen lace. You cross deserts where time is warped; in the distance, a single crimson cloud hangs stationary for three days. You drink from stagnant, iridescent pools that taste of oxidized memory, and the lack of food turns your hunger into a clear, humming euphoria.

Your compass spins uselessly, so you navigate by the faint, shimmering trails of *lost colors*—the ghosts of green and blue that still cling to the ruined landscape.

As you travel deeper, the dream turns more abstract. The dangers stop being tangible raiders or mutated creatures; they become psychological chasms. You walk for hours along a highway where the gravity keeps shifting sideways, forcing you to crawl past rusting cars balanced precariously on the edge of the void. You encounter a silent marketplace where all the vendors are reflections of yourself, offering impossible goods: bottled laughter, the warmth of a forgotten summer, the coordinates of yesterday. You decline them all.

Finally, you reach a place that defies the surrounding decay. It is a ravine, shielded by immense black basalt cliffs. As you descend, the oppressive silence begins to thin.

It is replaced by a sound that is both unbearable and breathtaking: **the sustained, perfect note of a cello.**

The source is a massive, concave basin carved into the rock, filled not with water, but with the purest, deepest emerald light. Floating at the center of this light is the origin of the sound: a single, colossal, polished seed pod—not unlike the seed of an ancient tree—vibrating endlessly.

As you approach the basin, the cello note deepens, transforming into the sound of every sound that was ever lost: the murmur of a crowded theatre, the peal of forgotten bells, the soft rustle of leaves that no longer exist, and finally, the singular, fragile sound of your own name spoken by a voice you cannot place, yet instantly recognize as the sound of home.

You reach out a trembling hand to the emerald light, and the dream solidifies for a perfect, agonizing moment. You realize that the Last Sound is not something that survives the apocalypse; it is the **unspoken potential** for things to be rebuilt, the seed of sound, ready to bloom again only if someone is there to listen.

The weight of the cello note presses down on you, heavy with memory and infinite possibility. You inhale the light, and as the sound reaches a frequency too high for your physical ears to bear, the emerald pool shatters into a million shards of ringing glass, and you wake up.
