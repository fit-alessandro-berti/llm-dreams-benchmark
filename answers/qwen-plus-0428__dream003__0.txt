You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns etched into the surface—geometric shapes that seem to shift when viewed from different angles. The box is made of a material that glows faintly in the dim light of your bedroom, as if it were alive.

A soft hum emanates from within, and the patterns begin to move, forming a sequence of symbols that resemble ancient scripts. They seem to pulse in rhythm with your heartbeat. You feel an inexplicable pull toward the box, as though it's calling to you.

Suddenly, the patterns change, and the box begins to open on its own. A low, melodic sound fills the room, and the box creaks open with a gentle click. Inside lies a small, glowing orb that pulses in time with your breath. It feels warm and familiar, like something you’ve seen before but can’t place.

As you reach for it, the room becomes silent. The patterns fade, and the box closes once more, leaving you alone in the dark. You’re left with only the memory of the strange, beautiful hum and the lingering warmth of the orb in your hand.
