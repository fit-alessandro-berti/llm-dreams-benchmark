...to feel a wave of warmth wash over me. It's a strange feeling, almost like the sun is suddenly shining directly on my face, but inside. My palms are dry, which is unusual for me in these situations, and a small, almost imperceptible smile tugs at my lips. Then, as I open my mouth to speak, the words... they're not mine.

They pour out, beautiful, soaring prose that I could never have crafted in a million years. It's not just the language, it's the emotion. The speech is filled with a deep, resonating truth, a kind of wisdom that seems ancient and yet utterly relevant to everyone in the room. I speak of connection, of understanding, of the hidden magic woven into the fabric of everyday life.

As I speak, the faces in the audience begin to shift. They're not just listening, they're *becoming*. Their features soften, their eyes sparkle with recognition, with a joy I can almost feel myself. Someone in the front row starts to weep, silently, tears tracing clean paths down their cheeks. Then another, and another. But these aren’t tears of sadness; they’re tears of… something else. Something profound and uplifting.

The lights begin to change. The harsh stage illumination softens, bathing the hall in a soft, golden glow. The air hums with an unseen energy, a palpable vibration that seems to course through my own veins. The speech goes on and on, a cascade of perfect sentences that seem to write themselves. I find myself gesturing, my hands moving in graceful, almost choreographed movements, as if I'm conducting an unseen symphony.

Suddenly, a small, emerald green hummingbird, its wings a blur of motion, darts out from behind the podium and hovers in front of my face. It looks at me, its tiny, intelligent eyes seeming to understand every word. It dips its head, almost in a bow, and then, as if on cue, the entire room erupts.

But it's not applause. It's something else. It's... *singing*. A collective, harmonious chant, a song I've never heard before, yet somehow know. The melody wraps around me, lifting me, carrying me. I feel weightless, connected to the music, connected to the humming, vibrating energy, connected to the silent, weeping, singing audience. And then, just as the song reaches its crescendo... I see it.

A single, perfect flower, a lotus in full bloom, materializes in the center of the stage, its petals unfolding slowly, revealing a core of pure, radiant light. And as the light expands, enveloping me, I know... I know what I'm meant to say next. I know what *everyone* needs to hear... and then...
