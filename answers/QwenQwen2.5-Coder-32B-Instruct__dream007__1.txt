...take a step back and listen to each other's perspectives. You agree to a timeout for a few minutes and go to separate rooms. Once the initial intensity has passed, you return and each take turns explaining your viewpoints.

Your friend begins by sharing their feelings and concerns, which you listen to attentively. You validate their emotions and acknowledge the importance of their point of view. Even though you still have reservations, you show empathy and try to understand where they are coming from.

When it's your turn, you share your perspective with the same level of respect and openness. You explain your position and the reasons why it is important to you, and take time to address any misunderstandings that may have occurred.

Throughout the conversation, you both make a conscious effort to communicate respectfully and avoid personal attacks. You agree to disagree on some points, but also work to find common ground where you can both compromise.

After hours of productive dialogue, you both feel a sense of relief and understanding. While the original disagreement remains unresolved, you recognize the value of each other's perspectives and appreciate the effort you both made to work through it. You leave feeling closer and more connected than when you started.
