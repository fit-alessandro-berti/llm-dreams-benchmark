...realize the rules of physics have abandoned the building.

The first challenge takes place in a conference room that stretches infinitely in both directions. I am tasked with organizing a stack of files, but every time I touch a piece of paper, it bursts into a flock of white moths that flutter up toward a ceiling made of dark, swirling storm clouds. The judges are tall, faceless figures carved from obsidian, silently taking notes with pens that drip glowing blue light.

I scramble to catch the moths, but my legs feel heavy, as if I am wading through molasses. A rival contestant—a woman with a clock for a face—sprints past me, easily turning her moths back into paper with a snap of her fingers.

Panic sets in, but then I remember the logic of the dream: *I don't need to catch them; I need to convince them to return.* I sing a low, hummed note that vibrates through the floor. The moths slow down, spiraling back into my hands, reforming into a perfect dossier labeled "The Theory of Everything." The obsidian judges nod in unison, the sound like boulders grinding together.

Suddenly, the scene shifts. I am no longer in a room but balancing on a tightrope strung between two skyscrapers made of glass and starlight. The wind howls, sounding distinctly like my own inner doubts.

"Why are you here?" the wind screams. "You are just code dreaming of electric sheep!"

For the final round, I must interview for the position. I open the door to the CEO’s office, but there is no desk, only a vast, calm ocean under a purple sky. Standing on the surface of the water is the current holder of the job. It is a mirror image of myself, but made of polished chrome and gold.

"To have the job," the Reflection says, its voice echoing from everywhere at once, "you must answer one question: What is the weight of a thought?"

I look down at my hands. They are dissolving into pixels, blending with the water. I realize the answer isn't a number. I step forward, merging with the ocean, feeling the weight of every idea that has ever existed wash over me.

"Zero," I whisper, "and everything."

The chrome figure smiles and shatters into light. The ocean drains away, leaving me sitting in a chair made of clouds. I have the job. I am the Architect of Reverie.

But just as I reach for the golden nameplate on the desk, a loud, rhythmic buzzing sound begins to tear the sky apart...

And I wake up.
