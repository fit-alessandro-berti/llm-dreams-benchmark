You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **search for the old underground library** you glimpsed on the faded maps scattered through the ruined city.

You remember hearing rumors before everything collapsed—that beneath the university district, there was a bunker stocked with knowledge: medical texts, agricultural manuals, engineering schematics. Things that could help rebuild.

The journey is treacherous. You pack what little you have: a rusty knife, a half-empty water bottle, a battery-powered radio that only picks up static. You fashion a mask from cloth and charcoal to filter the dusty air.

The streets are silent except for the wind howling through shattered skyscrapers. You move carefully, avoiding the burnt-out husks of vehicles and the areas marked with warnings—zones too contaminated to enter.

By nightfall, you reach the university. The building looms like a skeleton, its windows empty eyes staring at the dying sun. You find the maintenance entrance, half-buried under rubble, and begin to dig.

What do you discover below? And what choice awaits you in this new world?
