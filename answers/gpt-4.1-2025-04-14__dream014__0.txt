accept gratefully, feeling a wave of relief wash over you. As you follow them through colorful, winding streets, the city's chaos seems to fade, replaced by warm laughter and the glow of lanterns above. They share stories about hidden gardens, secret rooftops, and little cafes only locals know. With each turn, your fear dissolves into curiosity.

One of the strangers—a tall woman with bright eyes—pauses by a faded blue door and hands you a small, intricately folded map. The map is full of doodles and notes, guiding you not just to your intended destination, but to places of beauty and wonder tucked away in the city’s heart. The group encourages you: “Explore, trust yourself, and know you’re not truly alone.”

As you step through the blue door, you find yourself in a quiet courtyard bathed in morning sunlight. Flowers bloom along the walls, and a gentle breeze carries music from somewhere unseen. For the first time, you feel at home, even in this strange city—the kindness of strangers lighting your way.
