You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and **the leaves shimmer with an unnatural, iridescent blue before instantly dissolving into a blinding rush of green and purple. Not a normal storm; it thrums with a subtle, resonating melody – like a thousand tiny, forgotten instruments.**  

Your feet don’t *fall* as you walk. Instead, you’re gently drifting, carried along by the swaying boughs with an unsettling feeling of inevitability. The trees themselves begin to twist into improbable shapes with long, delicate limbs sprouting from their trunks.  Visibility narrows almost entirely around you – a swirling vortex of light and shade. You notice tiny figures begin to emerge from the gloom around you - figures sculpted from moss and dew drops radiating faint, phosphorescent light. There's no harshness, just a serene kind of… dissolution.

You reach out, trying to grasp one of these shimmering forms, but your hand passes through them like smoke. A deep stillness settles, heavy and comforting, then a voice – impossibly calm and utterly devoid of meaning – whispers your name a hundred times, each word echoing with a peculiar, ancient sadness.

Panic doesn't come naturally. It’s replaced by a bewildering sense of *familiarity.* The storm hadn't hurt you, it *revealed* you. A fragmented image flashes within the green and blue – a single, porcelain doll with a cracked smile, tumbling through the roots of a grand oak. A wave of forgotten loss, bittersweet and intensely real, washes over you. You instinctively know that this storm isn’t about chaos, it’s about… remembering. 

Suddenly, one of the mossy shapes reaches out and gently smooths your cheek.  You don’t see faces, but you *feel* the weight of their silent sorrow, and you understand, instinctively, where you’re *meant* to head, even though you have no conscious direction.  

As the figure settles beside you, a single, perfect lily blossoms in your palm - its white petals glowing with the same unnatural blue light as the leaves. It feels cool and heavy in your grasp, a promise of gentle surrender. 

And then… the swirling disappears. The light dims. The moss settles. You’re standing once more in the heart of the forest, the sun breaking through the leaves, but something has undeniably shifted within you - a profound sense of recognition for a past you can barely recall.  You feel... less like a traveler, more like a returning vessel.  You are *home*.
