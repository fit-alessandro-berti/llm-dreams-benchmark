 and as you reach toward it, your fingers dissolve into wisps of violet smoke before they can make contact. The canvas doesn't reject you; rather, it inhales you, drawing the smoke of your digits into its fibers until your hand becomes a brushstroke of midnight blue bleeding across the white.

You realize, with the casual acceptance peculiar to dreams, that you are not observing the canvas—you are *falling into* it. The landscape of shifting geometries collapses behind you like a deck of cards swept off a table, and suddenly you are inside the blankness, which is not empty at all but crammed with every color that has not yet been named. 

Here, gravity is optional. You swim through textures instead of air: the roughness of unsaid goodbyes, the velvet of déjà vu, the static electricity of almost-remembered songs. The blank canvas was never a surface to be filled but a membrane between the world of seeing and the world of being-seen.

You touch your face and find it smooth as porcelain, then fractal, then liquid mercury. Other dreamers flicker past you—some trapped as hummingbirds made of geometry, others expanding into storms of turquoise and gold. You understand that you are meant to paint, but there is no paint, only the pressure of your intention. Where you focus, reality congeals: a spiral staircase made of humming silence, a door framed by the sound of rain on childhood windows.

The canvas is breathing now, rising and falling like a sleeping giant's chest, and with each exhale it pushes you outward, back toward the border of waking. But you leave something behind in the white expanse—not an image, but a question, suspended like a dewdrop on a spider's thread, waiting for the next sleeper to find it and wonder why they are crying colors they have never seen before.
