# The Canvas of Dreams

You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and a brush that hovers in midair, its bristles dripping with a luminous paint that shifts between colors you've never seen before — hues that don't have names, that exist somewhere between ultraviolet and memory.

The moment your fingers close around the brush, you feel it pulse like a heartbeat.

You make your first stroke — a simple curve — and the line *lifts off the canvas*, spiraling into the air. It becomes a staircase. Without thinking, you climb it. Each step rings out a different note, and behind you the melody assembles itself into a song you've somehow always known.

At the top, the staircase dissolves, but you don't fall. You're standing on the sky now, and below you the canvas has grown enormous — stretching to every horizon, becoming the ground itself. Everything in this world, you realize, was once painted by someone dreaming.

You kneel and paint a door.

It opens. Warm light spills out, carrying the scent of a place you loved as a child but can't quite place. You step through.

On the other side is a room filled with thousands of canvases — each one painted by a different dreamer, each one alive, each one a small breathing world. Some are joyful, riotous with color. Others are quiet, just a single trembling line against white. All of them are beautiful.

In the center of the room sits an empty frame, and beneath it, a small plaque that reads:

*"This one is yours. It has always been yours."*

You raise the brush again. The paint shifts to a color that feels like **hope** — not the word, but the actual sensation — and you begin.

You don't know what you're painting yet.

But it knows you.

And as the brush moves, the walls of the room fall away, and the dream expands, and you understand — finally, gently — that you were never just *in* the dream.

You were the canvas all along.
