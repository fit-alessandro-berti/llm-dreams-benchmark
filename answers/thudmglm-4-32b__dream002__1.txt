You feel a storm approaching and **a deep rumble echoes through the trees, not just from the ground, but as if something is stirring deep within the forest itself. The air trembles, charged with an electric tension, and shadows that were coalescing seem to come to life, swirling and dancing around the ancient tree roots. You instinctively shield your eyes against a flash of unnatural lightning that streaks not across the sky, but *between* the trunks, illuminating strange symbols burned into the bark. The wind picks up, howling a eerie, wordless chant, carrying the scent of damp earth and something else... something metallic and ancient.**
