…build something that doesn’t move.

You choose a roof that used to be a bus, long since welded to the skeleton of a parking garage by vines of rebar and the slow cement of dust. The city around it is a field of jagged teeth, windows knocked out, signs blown smooth by wind. There’s a shopping cart on its side like a beetle. There’s a billboard that says WE ARE OPEN but the letters have faded until they only say WE ARE.

You gather soil from a lot where a nursery burned. It smells faintly sweet, like something remembered. You find a sack of seeds in a hardware store with a hole in its corner, pea-sized promises spilling wherever you walk. You find a cracked mirror and hold it to the sky, trying to coax light into the shadowed places. A city has so many shadowed places.

Water is the problem. Water is always the problem. You build a net from curtain-sheer and broken antennae and tie it where the wind sifts. The fog comes some nights, dragging its belly across the rooftops, and your net catches its breath. You learn where the pipes still remember their purpose. Sometimes the pipes cough up rust and ghosts; once, a frog, pale and indignant, which you carry back cupped in both hands like an apology.

You decide you will make a beacon that doesn’t burn. Fire brings the wrong kind of company. You string spoons and tabs from soda cans on a line between the bus and a cracked light pole. The wind plays them. It’s not music exactly, but it’s not silence, either. At night, when the chimes tinkle, you can pretend to hear voices that are not the wind. You hang a lantern under the bus’ sign—the route name has bleached away—but the lens you found at the planetarium bends it into a soft halo. It makes shadows gentle. Things hide in gentle as easily as in harsh, but it is easier on your heart.

Sometimes you walk the empty streets and talk to your own reflection in puddles. It gives sensible advice. Once, you see a dog trotting down the center stripe with something green in its mouth. You follow, careful. The dog never looks back. It leads you to a yard fenced with bicycle frames, and behind them grows one stubborn quince, leaves waxy, fruit like small suns. You are not the only one planting, then. You leave your sack of seeds there, a few of them. You leave a spoon. On the way back, you take a path you swear wasn’t there yesterday, lined with moss glowing faintly as if remembering rain.

On the roof, you press seeds into soil with your thumb. You sing to them because you have the kind of voice that doesn’t scare birds. The first shoots rise in a week. They’re nervous, fragile, as if they know what goes on here. You build them armor from cut plastic bottles, little clear domes that make their own weather. The domes fog with your breath as you lean close to check them. When it storms, the domes rattle and hum, and you lie inside the bus listening to the drone like a far-off engine.

On a day when the sky looks bruised and heavy, someone answers your chimes. It is not a voice. It is another thread of tin and silver rattling somewhere along the avenue. You lean out over the railing and see two figures where the street buckles into a hill of glass. They are small as the punctures in your sack had been. They lift their hands and you, impulsively, wave a trowel like a flag.

They are children. They climb like cats and slide like stones, and they introduce themselves with names they made up: Flint and Marigold. Flint carries a radio that eats batteries and spits static. Marigold carries a jar with a beetle in it, the beetle wearing a halo of luminous mold. They look at your domes with the frank hunger of the starved and the starred. You feed them broth warmed by a candle. They tell you about a woman who braided maps into her hair and a man who whistles birds out of chimneys. They say there’s a library by the river where the books have been teaching each other to swim.

You show them how to pour water slow, like it matters. You show them the way the seedlings lean toward your mirror. You ask where they sleep. They shrug and look at the bright beetle. The beetle seems to shrug too. You lay out blankets on the bus seats. Sleep comes to all of you fast and careful.

After that, others begin to find you. A woman who collects words. A boy with a half-grown beard who makes tools that fit the hands that need them. A nurse who has run out of bandages but not patience. They bring you stories and also nails, also rope, also a compass that points to the loudest sound. You trade seedlings like secrets. You teach one another the old songs and the new mathematics that has sprung up to measure scarcity: how many cups a fog net yields if the wind is bitter, how wide to spread your fingers to read the speed of dust.

From the bus roof, the city looks less like a mouth and more like a map. You draw it with chalk you grind from stray limestone, marking places by what they offer. The fountain that catches rain. The billboard that says WE ARE. The woman with the hair of maps. The quince that didn’t give up. When you run out of chalk, you use ash. The lines soften. The map becomes a story.

Danger does not stop because you stopped running. It prowls and you feel it—a prickle at the base of the skull, a hush in the wind chimes. Sometimes hands come over the edge of the roof, and you put your boot on them, hard, and you don’t apologize. Sometimes you wake to footprints on the stair that aren’t yours and never will be. Once, in the purple hour, shapes move along the street below, too many joints, blinking in unison with the broken traffic lights. You lie still and let the breath go out of you until you are so thin and quiet that even your fear forgets you.

But in the morning, there are also bees, attracted by something the beetle taught the moss. A vine finds the pole and climbs it. The nurse grows mint on the dash of the bus, and the bus smells like clean teeth. Flint draws on the windows with dry-erase markers, leaves equations and jokes for ghosts. Marigold names every plant and every spoon.

The first fruit comes the night you dream of rain in color. It is a tomato, misshapen, fierce, tasting like a word you can’t translate. You cut it into as many slices as there are mouths and there is still a sliver left. You tuck that sliver, with its seeds, into your own. The world tilts. The bus creaks. Somewhere, very far away, you hear the radio finally find a station, a voice humming a weather report for a storm that never arrives. Or maybe it already did, and you are what was left.

When you wake, in the dream, because it is that kind of dream, the fog net is pearl-heavy. The chimes sing a chord they have never sung before, something like the syllable before a name. The billboard catches the light and, for a second, says not WE ARE but WE.

You keep building. You keep planting. You decide, again and again, to stay. The dangers remain, the shortage sharpens the senses, and yet the roof blooms in small, stubborn circles. A city can be a wound. It can also be a scab that is learning to be skin.

And when you finally actually wake, sheets warm, throat tasting faintly of mint and metal, there is dirt under your fingernails you don’t remember, and a spoon in your pocket you cannot place, and the certainty that somewhere, even now, a chime is moving in the wind, saying the only thing that matters: Come.
