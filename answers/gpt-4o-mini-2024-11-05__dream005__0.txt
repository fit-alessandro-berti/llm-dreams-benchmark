start to feel overwhelmed by the noise and movement. There’s an undercurrent of chatter, laughter, and clinking glasses, but the faces around you seem unfamiliar, as if everyone is lost in their own conversation. You try to approach one group but hesitate, unsure of how to break into their conversation. You notice someone’s eyes briefly meet yours, but before you can act on it, they turn away, resuming their talk.

You take a few steps back, scanning the room more intently. The crowd feels dense, as if it's swirling in different directions. Then, you spot the person you know, standing near the far end of the room. They appear to be laughing with a group, completely absorbed in the moment. You start to walk toward them, but just as you get closer, someone you don’t know bumps into you, spilling a drink, and for a brief moment, you're caught in a whirlwind of apologies and awkwardness.

After the brief chaos, you finally make your way to your friend, but when you try to speak, the words catch in your throat. The atmosphere shifts, and instead of a warm greeting, you feel like an outsider, as if you’ve interrupted something important. The laughter around you seems hollow, and even though you’re surrounded by familiar faces, you start to feel increasingly invisible, like you’ve somehow slipped into the background of the scene.

A sense of unease creeps over you, and you wonder if you’ll ever truly find your place in the crowd. The dream seems to stretch on, and just as you consider leaving, you wake up.
