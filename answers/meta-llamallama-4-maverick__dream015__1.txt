...embark on a perilous journey to reach the fabled "Garden of Eden", a supposed safe haven where resources are plentiful and the air is said to be clean. You've heard rumors of its existence from a tattered map etched on a piece of worn leather, passed down through generations of survivors.

As you navigate through the desolate wasteland, the ruins of a once-great city loom in the distance. Crumbling skyscrapers now serve as makeshift habitats for the twisted creatures that roam the streets. You keep a watchful eye on the horizon, your senses heightened as you scan for any signs of danger.

You're equipped with a battered backpack containing a few bottles of purified water, a first-aid kit, and a well-worn rifle. The weight of the pack is a comforting presence, a reminder that you're prepared for the challenges ahead.

As you trek through the barren landscape, you stumble upon a small, makeshift settlement. The inhabitants, a ragtag group of survivors, eye you warily from behind their makeshift barricades. You hail them with a cautious smile, hoping to negotiate for supplies.

The leader, a grizzled old man with a scar above his left eyebrow, eyes you up and down before grudgingly inviting you to join them. As you share a meager meal of canned beans and stale bread, you learn that they've received reports of a roving gang, known as the "Scorchers", who've been terrorizing nearby settlements.

The old man leans in, his voice barely above a whisper, "If you're headed to the Garden, you'll need to be careful. The Scorchers are likely to be lurking in the area. But if you're determined to go, I can give you a name - 'Axel' - he's a trader who's been known to travel the route. He might be willing to guide you... for a price."

You nod, a spark of determination igniting within you. You'll find Axel, and together, you'll brave the dangers that lie ahead. The Garden of Eden awaits, and you're one step closer to finding it...

As you prepare to leave, you hear a faint rumble in the distance, growing louder by the second. The ground begins to shake, and the survivors' eyes snap towards the horizon, their faces etched with fear. "It's the Scorchers," someone whispers. "They've found us." What do you do next?
