 applied some vibrant paints to it in various forms - like swirls of gold that seemed to shimmer, tiny droplets of blue that made an aquatic sound as they danced across, and spiky purple strokes that seemed to reach out. 

Then, as you reached out another hand to touch it, the canvas suddenly morphed. The shapes of the colors morphed into a giant, shimmering creature that seemed to come from your dream self. It had shimmering, amorphous parts that moved like waves, legs that were streaks of color, and its "face" looked like a blend of emotions made of light and paint. 

The creature extended a glowing tentacle and gently grabbed you, and as it pulled you in, the world around you shifted into mesmerizing abstract patterns that pulsed in time with your heartbeat.
