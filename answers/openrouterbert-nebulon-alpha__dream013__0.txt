**The Maze of Echoing Shadows**

As you solve the final mechanism of the last puzzle—a series of interlocking gears that hummed like a living thing—the wall before you groans open, revealing not another corridor, but a vast, circular chamber bathed in an eerie, shifting light. The air smells of ozone and old parchment, and the floor beneath you is no longer stone, but something smooth and reflective, like polished obsidian.

At the center of the chamber stands a **pedestal**, and upon it rests a **mirror**—not of glass, but of liquid silver, its surface rippling as if disturbed by an unseen wind. As you step closer, the reflection in the mirror doesn’t show your face. Instead, it reveals **another version of the maze**, identical to the one you’ve just traversed, but inverted, as if you’re looking at it from the other side. And at the heart of *that* maze, a figure stands, watching you.

The figure raises a hand, and the mirror’s surface **ripples violently**. The reflection distorts, warping into a scene you recognize—**your own memories**, but twisted. You see yourself as a child, solving a puzzle box your grandfather gave you, but the box is *alive*, its pieces writhing like insects. You see yourself in school, staring at a math problem, but the numbers bleed into the page, forming a face that whispers equations in a language you almost understand. You see yourself now, in this very maze, but from *outside*, as if you’ve been watched this whole time.

A voice—**your own voice, but layered with something else**—echoes from the mirror:

*"You’ve been solving the wrong puzzles."*

The chamber trembles. The walls begin to **shift**, the obsidian floor cracking like ice. The mirror’s reflection **splits**, revealing not one maze, but *dozens*, each one a variation of the one you’ve just escaped. Some are made of fire, others of water, others of pure sound. And in each one, a version of *you* stands, trapped, their eyes locked onto yours.

The voice speaks again, softer now, almost pleading:

*"The final puzzle isn’t here. It’s in the space between the mazes. The space between *you*."*

The mirror’s surface **darkens**, and for a moment, you see nothing. Then—

A **door** appears in the air before you, floating. It’s made of the same shifting silver as the mirror, and it has no handle, no lock. Just a single word carved into its surface, written in a script that hurts your eyes to read:

**"CHOICE"**

Behind you, the maze you just left **collapses in on itself**, the walls folding like origami, the puzzles unraveling into threads of light. The only way forward is through the door.

But as you reach for it, the mirror’s reflection **laughs**.

And then—

You wake up.

(Or do you?)

---
**What do you do?**
- **Step through the door.**
- **Turn away and try to find another exit.**
- **Smash the mirror.**
- **Ask the reflection what it wants.**
- *(Or suggest your own ending.)*
