You sit at your desk, the air thick with the static hum of fluorescent lights. Your boss’s words still ring in your ears: *"It needs to be done by sunrise—no, before the moon sets."* The project? A 10,000-page report on data that doesn’t exist, formatted in a font that shifts when you’re not looking. Your cursor blinks mockingly as you try to open the file—your computer screen cracks, revealing a swirling void beneath the desktop.  

The office around you begins to warp. Cubicles stretch like taffy, and your coworker from accounting—Mr. Thompson—morphs into a towering ostrich in a suit, pecking at a keyboard with his beak. Your boss, now a silhouette with too many arms, gestures impatiently toward the report. You glance at the clock: the hands are spinning backward, and the numbers melt into liquid, pooling on your desk.  

Panic surges. You frantically reach for coffee, but the mug spills black sand onto your keyboard. It hardens into tiny, screeching crickets that scatter. Then, a realization: *This is a dream.* You pinch yourself—your finger passes through your wrist like smoke. The dream shudders.  

Suddenly, you’re standing in a library of floating books, each one labeled with impossible titles (*"The History of Tomorrow," "Tax Codes for Dragon Shapeshifters"*). A voice whispers, *"What if you didn’t need to finish… but to *understand*?"* The books snap open, pages fluttering into your hands. You see the report—not as data, but as a story, a pattern. You laugh, and the words assemble themselves, glowing gold on the screen.  

You return to your desk, submit the report… and the void in your computer yawns wider. Your boss dissolves into a chorus of seagulls, squawking approval. The deadline passes. The moon hangs still in the sky. You wake up at your desk, coffee cold, a single cricket chirping on your monitor. The report is gone. But your inbox has a new message:  

**"You’ve been promoted. Training starts at midnight."**
