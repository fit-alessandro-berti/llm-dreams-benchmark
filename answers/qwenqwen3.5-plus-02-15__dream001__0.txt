You start to run, but your feet feel as though they are wading through thick, warm honey. Every step is an effort, slowing your pace to a frustrating crawl. The city around you seems to breathe; the skyscrapers aren't made of steel and glass, but of shifting, iridescent coral that hums a low, vibrating tune.

You pull out your phone to check the address, but the screen is filled with swirling constellations instead of text. As you tilt your head, the stars rearrange themselves into a map, pointing toward a towering spire in the distance that seems to grow taller the more you look at it.

Suddenly, the street beneath you tilts upward like a escalator, carrying you faster toward the spire. People pass you by, but they have no faces—only smooth, reflective surfaces that show glimpses of your own childhood memories. One of them hands you a silver key without saying a word.

"You're late," a voice echoes, not from the person, but from the air itself. "But the meeting hasn't started yet because *you* are the agenda."

You reach the base of the spire, where a door made of liquid mercury ripples open. Inside, there is no conference table, only a single chair floating in a void of starlight. As you sit, the realization hits you: the important meeting isn't with a boss or a client. It's the moment you finally have to answer the question you've been avoiding in your waking life.

The mercury door seals shut behind you, and the silence is absolute, waiting for you to speak.
