...reach for the wheel, only to find it is no longer made of wood, but of freezing cold glass. 

I grip it tight, and as I do, the roaring wind suddenly turns into the sound of a thousand violins playing out of tune. I look down at the deck and realize the ship is not floating on water, but on a shifting ocean of dark blue bedsheets that stretch out to the horizon.

"Hoist the gravity!" I shout, though my voice comes out as a bubble of light.

The crew, who now all have the face of my third-grade teacher, nod in unison. They pull on ropes that descend from the moon. The ship tilts, defying physics, and we slide vertically up the wall of a massive wave. But the wave doesn't crash; it turns into a tunnel of clouds. We sail through it, weightless, until the storm breaks into a shower of silver coins, and we are suddenly drifting calmly through the air above a city made entirely of coral.

I let go of the glass wheel. It melts into a puddle of water at my feet. I know, with absolute dream-certainty, that we have arrived exactly where we were never going.
