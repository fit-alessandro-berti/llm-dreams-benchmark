…you face various challenges and strange, shifting landscapes that feel like they’re made of your own thoughts. One moment you’re solving riddles in a library where the books whisper answers, the next you’re running a relay through a city built entirely of glass, carrying a glowing résumé that changes every time you blink. The other competitors become familiar faces from your past — a childhood friend, a favorite teacher, a stranger who looks exactly like you — and they all cheer you on as if the competition is a collaboration rather than a contest.

In the final round, you step into a room with no walls, only sky, and a single interviewer sitting at a desk floating among the clouds. They smile and slide a contract toward you, but instead of words, the page shows scenes from your life: moments when you felt most alive, most curious, most yourself. The interviewer asks, “Are you sure this is the job you want, or is it the feeling you’re chasing?” As you reach to sign, the pen turns into a key, and a door appears where there was only air. You open it and walk through, expecting the prize… but you wake up in your bed, heart pounding, the feeling of possibility lingering like a soft echo.
