...run. That's the first instinct. To run towards something, anything that looks like a landmark. But every street looks the same, a canyon of towering buildings made of polished obsidian and shimmering brass. The sky above is a strange, bruised-plum color, even though you can feel the warmth of a noon sun on your face.

You fumble in your pockets, a wave of relief washing over you as your fingers close around your phone. You pull it out. The screen is cracked in a perfect spiral, and instead of apps, it shows a swirling star-scape. You tap it, and a gentle, three-note chime echoes, but nothing changes. It’s useless.

Panic, cold and sharp, begins to prickle at the back of your neck. You need to ask for directions. You spot a street vendor, but they aren’t selling hot dogs or newspapers. They’re selling clocks. Hundreds of them, all ticking out of sync. There are clocks with no hands, clocks that run backwards, hourglasses filled with shimmering blue dust instead of sand.

The vendor is a woman with eyes the color of old silver coins. "Lost?" she asks, her voice like the rustling of dry leaves.

"Yes! I have a meeting, a very important one, but I don't know where it is!" you say, the words tumbling out in a rush.

She smiles, a slow, knowing expression. She picks up a small, copper clock. "The problem isn't where," she says, holding it out to you. "It's when."

You look down at your own wrist, but where your watch should be, there’s only a faint, fading tan line. The vendor’s words echo in your head, making no sense and perfect sense all at once. You look up from the clock to ask what she means, but she’s gone. The cart and its cacophony of ticking are gone too. In its place is a single, wrought-iron lamppost, humming with a soft, internal light.

The city is changing around you. The sound of your own frantic heartbeat is the only constant. A street that was straight a moment ago now curves into an impossible spiral. You start running again, but your feet feel heavy, as if the cobblestones have become magnetic. With every step, a whisper follows you, seeming to come from the walls themselves. "You're late... you're late..."

Desperate, you duck into an alleyway, hoping to find a shortcut. The alley is narrow and dark, but it opens into a vast, silent square. In the center of the square is an enormous, ancient tree. Its branches are bare, but hanging from them are not leaves, but doors. Hundreds of wooden doors of all shapes and sizes, swaying gently in a breeze you can't feel. Each door has a different handle: a brass knob, an iron ring, a crystal lever.

You know, with the unshakeable certainty that only dreams can provide, that one of these doors leads to your meeting. But which one? The clock in your hand from the vendor has started ticking, but it's not a sound—it's a vibration, a rhythmic pulse against your palm.

You close your eyes and focus on the feeling of the meeting—the importance, the anxiety, the hope. You walk forward, hand outstretched, letting the pulsing clock guide you. Your fingers brush against a small, simple door made of unpainted pine. It has no handle at all.

You push.

The door swings open not into a room, but into a memory. You are standing in your childhood bedroom. The light is soft and golden. Sitting on the floor, cross-legged and much younger, is you. They look up, their face open and unlined by worry.

"Oh, good," your younger self says, their voice clear as a bell. "You're finally here."

"The meeting..." you stammer, looking around the familiar, yet distant room. "Am I late?"

Your younger self smiles and pats the floor beside them. "It doesn't start until you sit down."

And as you sink to the floor, the frantic anxiety drains away, replaced by a profound and sudden peace. The weight of the meeting is gone. You realize you have all the time in the world.
