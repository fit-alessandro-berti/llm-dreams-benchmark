As you take a hesitant step forward, the sky above darkens with astonishing speed. Thick, bruised clouds swirl and gather, blotting out the sun and casting the forest in a cold, blue twilight. A sharp gust of wind whips through the trees, sending leaves fluttering and branches creaking overhead.

You pull your coat tighter around you, heart thumping in your chest. The air grows heavy with the scent of rain and earth. Thunder rumbles in the distance, a low growl that vibrates through your bones. Lightning flashes, illuminating the trunks of ancient trees and the underbrush that shimmers with dew.

You quicken your pace, searching for shelter from the coming downpour. The peaceful ambiance is replaced by the urgent sounds of the storm: the patter of rain beginning to fall, the hiss of water hitting dry leaves, and the distant call of animals seeking cover.

Just as you think you can’t make it to the small stone outcropping ahead, the sky opens up. Rain pours down in sheets, drenching you instantly. The storm is fierce but strangely exhilarating, and as you huddle under the rocky overhang, you feel a sense of calm amid the chaos, as if the forest itself is holding you safe.

You close your eyes and listen to the symphony of rain and thunder, letting the storm wash away your worries, even if just for a moment in the dream.
