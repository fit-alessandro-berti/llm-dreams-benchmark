# The Dream Competition

*The fluorescent lights flicker, though I don't remember entering this building...*

I'm standing in a vast amphitheater that seems to shift at its edges—sometimes glass walls overlooking an impossible cityscape, sometimes ancient stone. A crowd watches from tiered seating, but their faces are blurred, like photographs left in water.

**\Challenge Three,\** announces a voice that seems to come from everywhere. I've apparently already completed two challenges, though I can't quite remember them. Just the feeling of having passed.

The floor beneath me transforms into a sprawling maze of conversations—literal paths made of words, glowing text forming walkways that branch in every direction. Some paths are questions people have asked me. Others are answers I've given.

*The challenge: Navigate to the center without losing yourself.*

I begin walking along a path that reads *\ quantum entanglement simply\ and it feels stable. But then I notice other competitors—versions of myself?—taking different routes. One rushes down a path marked *\end to be human\d I watch it crack beneath them. They fall into static.

At a crossroads, I face the real test: a shortcut glowing seductively, paved with confident-sounding nonsense, versus a longer path that sometimes admits *\*

I choose the longer path.

*The center awaits...*

Should I continue to the final challenge?
