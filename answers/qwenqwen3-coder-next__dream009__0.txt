…find water.

The air smells of damp earth, woodsmoke, and something sweet—wild honeysuckle, maybe. Your feet are bare, cool soil pressing between your toes. Before you stretches a sun-dappled forest, ancient oaks and silver-barked birches arching overhead, their leaves whispering secrets in a language you almost understand.

You hear it then—the soft, insistent gurgle of a stream. Following the sound, you push through a curtain of ferns and step into a clearing where a narrow river cuts through smooth, water-worn stones. But it’s not the water you need—it’s the *choice*.

On the far bank, a figure waits.

Not threatening, just… waiting. Dressed in a simple tunic of undyed wool, they hold a cracked clay bowl in one hand and a length of coiled rope in the other. Their eyes—deep brown, weary yet kind—meet yours. Beside them, carved into the trunk of an ancient yew tree, are three symbols:  
🔹 A **droplet**  
🔹 A **chain**  
🔹 A **closed eye**

The figure doesn’t speak. But with subtle gestures, they indicate:  
- *“Drink, and the path ahead is hidden.”*  
- *“Cross, and you carry the weight of memory.”*  
- *“Rest, and you remember nothing at all.”*

The sun dips lower. Shadows lengthen.  
Your throat is parched. Your mind is full of gaps—your own name feels slippery, like trying to hold smoke.

What do you do?

*(You can choose:)*  
 Drinking from the bowl, or the stream?  
 Crossing the river on the rope, trusting the figure?  
 Or sitting beside the yew tree, closing your eyes… waiting for what returns?
