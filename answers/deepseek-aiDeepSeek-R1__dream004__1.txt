**Dream Continuation:**

As you step closer, the canvas ripples like liquid, its edges blurring into the kaleidoscopic air. A brush materializes in your hand, its bristles shimmering with unnamed hues. When you touch the canvas, the world stills—as if the chaos holds its breath.  

Your first stroke spills a deep cobalt, and suddenly the ground beneath you becomes a river, reflecting constellations that hum. A second stroke, gold and jagged, erects crystalline mountains that fracture and rebuild themselves in rhythm with your pulse. The paint *moves* on its own now, swirling into shapes that feel pulled from your memories: a childhood treehouse, the silhouette of a forgotten friend, a door ajar to blinding light.  

But the canvas whispers back. Where you paint order, it bleeds entropy. Flowers you draw wilt into smoke, forming letters in a language you *almost* understand. A self-portrait fractures, each shard showing a version of you—laughing, weeping, older, unborn. The brush grows heavier, each color now a emotion: vermilion grief, chartreuse longing, a black that tastes like silence.  

Just as you dip the brush into a pearlescent white, the canvas tears. Not apart—*open*. Beyond it, you see yourself sleeping, but the room is this ever-shifting world, and the dreamer is dreaming you. The brush slips from your hand, and as the canvas seals, one word echoes: *"Awake?"*  

You jolt upright—in bed, in darkness, your palm still tingling. On the windowsill, a single cobalt petal glows, then dissolves.
