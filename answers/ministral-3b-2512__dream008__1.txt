**Dream Continuation:**

The clock on the wall ticks loudly, but the numbers don’t seem to move—just spin in slow motion. Your boss, arms crossed, leans forward with that familiar smirk, their voice dripping with false urgency: *"We need this by tomorrow. No excuses. The client’s already on the phone, and they’re not taking no for an answer."* You swallow hard, your stomach twisting like a knot of nerves.

Then—*a whisper in your mind*—a voice you don’t recognize, smooth as silk: *"You’re not alone."* The words land like a punch. Before you can react, the air around you *shifts*. The fluorescent lights flicker, and suddenly, you’re standing in a vast, empty room—no walls, no ceiling, just an endless expanse of shifting colors. The voice repeats: *"This isn’t your first time here."* Your pulse quickens. *What is this place?*

A figure steps into view—a shadowy silhouette with eyes like polished obsidian. They tilt their head, studying you. *"You were supposed to be the one who could handle this,"* the voice murmurs. *"But you’re too afraid to ask the right questions."* The room *moves*, and suddenly, you’re back in the office—but the desk is now a mirror. Your reflection isn’t you. It’s a stranger, their hands trembling as they scribble frantically on a yellow legal pad. The words blur: *"If I fail, they’ll burn the world down."*

Your boss’s voice cuts through the dream: *"You’ve got this."* But the words taste like ash. The stranger’s reflection turns to you, their lips moving silently. *"They’re already watching."* The screen on your desk flickers—an image of a city in flames, a countdown timer counting down to zero.

Then—*a choice*. The door to your office swings open, and instead of your boss, a child’s laughter echoes. A little girl with wild curls and a backpack full of strange symbols stands there, holding a single, glowing key. *"You have to take it,"* she says, voice like wind through leaves. *"Or everything changes."*

The dream dissolves into static. You wake with a gasp, your sheets tangled around you, your heart pounding. The clock on your nightstand reads 3:17 AM. Outside, the city hums with life—cars, sirens, the distant chatter of coworkers. But for a second, you swear you heard a child’s giggle.

And then you remember: *You were given a project with an impossible deadline. And you just got a key.*
