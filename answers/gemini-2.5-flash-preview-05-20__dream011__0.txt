You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are **not academic at all.**

They are vivid memories, written in my own handwriting from different ages. One is a childhood note asking: "Why did you break your favorite toy?" Another is a scrawled teenage journal entry: "Are you truly happy, or just pretending?" A third is a fragment of a hushed conversation from college: "Do you believe in fate, or do you carve your own path?"

Some are just a single, unanswerable word: "Why?" "If?" "Now?"

And then they begin to subtly shift. The ink bleeds, the paper warps, and the words rearrange themselves into new, more unsettling queries. One question about a forgotten promise morphs into a stark, blank space, waiting for a confession. Another, about a past regret, becomes a mirror reflecting my own anxious face.

They're not testing knowledge; they're dissecting my very identity.

I pick up my pen, but it feels heavy, an extension of my own racing pulse. The room is silent, yet I hear a chorus of whispers, my own past selves murmuring answers I can no longer grasp. The clock on the wall has no hands, or maybe it has too many, spinning wildly. I try to write, but my hand shakes, forming only scribbles, echoes of half-formed thoughts. A sense of profound futility washes over me. How can I 'pass' a test that *is* me? How can my future career depend on understanding a self I'm still becoming?

Then, I look up, and the proctor is no longer there. Instead, the entire room is empty, save for one chair, directly across from mine. And in that chair, staring back at me with calm, expectant eyes, is a version of myself. A future self, perhaps, or a truer one. And I realize, with a jolt that ripples through my dream-self, that the exam isn't about answering the questions on the paper at all. It's about *this* gaze. It's about recognizing the person across from me, and finally understanding that the 'career' I'm determining isn't a job title, but the trajectory of who I am destined to become.

The room brightens, or maybe it dims, and I'm left suspended in that silent, knowing stare, the weight of my own future a soft, undeniable hum.
