Around you, people in rough-spun wool and leather move through a village of timber and thatch, speaking a dialect that’s just *almost* familiar—like hearing a language from a past life. You realize you need to blend in, but more urgently, you need to figure out *when*—and *who*—you are now. Your hands feel different: calloused, younger. A name echoes in your mind: *Caelen*. Is that you?

You notice eyes on you—curious, wary. One elder with a silver-ringed staff gestures for you to approach. Your stomach tightens. You need to answer in a way that doesn't mark you as an outsider. So you step forward, bow slightly, and say…?
