You start to frantically search your pockets, heart racing, fingers brushing against crumpled receipts and loose change. Miraculously, you pull out a slip of paper with an address scrawled in hurried ink: *47 Labyrinthine Avenue*. The name of the street feels ominous, but you clutch it like a lifeline.  

The city pulses around you—skyscrapers twist like corkscrews, their glass facades reflecting impossible angles. Streets branch and merge like veins, shifting subtly when you blink. A clocktower looms in the distance, its hands spinning both forward and backward. You break into a run, dodging crowds of faceless figures murmuring in languages that dissolve like smoke.  

An old man materializes at a corner, selling maps that glow faintly. “You’ll need this,” he says, pressing one into your palm. The paper unfolds endlessly, revealing a labyrinth that rearranges itself as you stare. “Follow the shadows,” he whispers. “They point truer than light here.”  

You sprint onward, guided by elongating silhouettes that arrow toward a gargantuan clocktower. Its gears groan audibly, each tick echoing like a hammer-strike. As you reach the door—numbered *47* in flickering gold—the final minute chimes. Inside, a spiral staircase stretches infinitely. You climb until your legs burn, bursting into a boardroom suspended among stars.  

A dozen versions of yourself sit at the table, each wearing a different expression. The one at the head gestures to an empty seat. “You’re just in time,” they say, as the clock strikes zero.  

You wake with a gasp, the scent of ozone fading, the dream’s urgency still coiled in your chest. On your bedside table, a faintly glowing map rests where none had been before.
