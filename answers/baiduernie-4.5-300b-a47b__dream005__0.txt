**Dream Continuation**:

As you weave through the crowd, the music shifts from a distant hum to a pulsating rhythm, making the atmosphere thrum with energy. Each group you pass seems to embody a different fragment of your subconscious. To your left, a circle of strangers laughs with metallic, echoing voices—their faces blurred as if seen through a fogged mirror. They’re framing a floating crystal ball filled with swirling smoke, its glow casting eerie shadows. When you squint, the smoke becomes memories you can’t quite place: a childhood treehouse, a phone number that no longer exists. 

Ahead, a woman in a dress made of live flowers beckons you closer. Her perfume smells of rain-soaked soil, and her hands leave petal-shaped imprints on your skin when she touches your arm. “They’re that way,” she whispers, pointing toward a spiral staircase materializing in the center of the room. The steps curl like a nautilus shell, disappearing into a ceiling that drips with liquid starlight. 

You climb cautiously, each step emitting a low, harmonic chirp. Halfway up, the walls dissolve into a dreamscape of floating islands. Some are upside-down castles; others are swirling galaxies trapped in glass jars. A group of shadowy figures perches on the edge of a cloud-island, their faces flickering between familiar and foreign. They’re arguing in a language that feels like a melody you’ve heard before, but never learned. 

Descending, you find yourself in a corridor lined with doors, each marked with a feel- ing rather than a number: “*Frustration*,” “*Nostalgia*,” “*That Time You Forgot to Feed the Cat*.” Behind one, a dimly lit room reveals your known person—but they’re locked in a duel with a doppelgänger wielding a sword of ice. Their voice overlaps with your own internal monologue: “*You’re late. But aren’t you always?*” 

The floor trembles. The walls begin to fold like origami, and the crowd melts into a sea of floating eyes, all blinking in unison. A child’s laughter erupts from the ceiling, scattering the eyes into a million fractured sparks. When the light fades, you’re back at the staircase—but now it descends into an unfamiliar kitchen where every surface is covered in jello. The person you came to find waves from the refrigerator, holding a sandwich made entirely of birthday candles. “*Finally,*” they say, their grin too wide for their face. “*We were about to start without you.*” 

The lights flicker. Some- where, a record player skips. And then—you wake.
