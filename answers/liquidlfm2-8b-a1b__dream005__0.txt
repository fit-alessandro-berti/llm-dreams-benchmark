...it’s like the air shifts with every step—slightly colder, suspiciously still. I weave through unfamiliar faces, each group humming or laughing, but only one voice feels like home—half-remembered, soft, like a warm thread in the crowd. I spot them at the edge of a corner booth, sitting alone but radiating quiet presence, eyes half-closed as if seeing something only they understand. They smile when I approach—not loud, not urgent—but warm, like recognition blooming in an otherwise shifting tide. 

Around them, a flurry of motion: laughter over drinks, clinking glasses, the clatter of plates. A woman in a tilted hat laughs too loudly at a joke no one else seems to hear. A man in a scarf stands awkwardly, staring in. But I move toward my person, even as fingers of doubt tug at my mind—*Is this real? Am I real?* 

Their hand meets mine—gentle, brief—but golden. They lean in, voice low, familiar, like saying your name after years. “There,” they whisper. And suddenly, the noise fades. The world narrows to quiet, to one heartbeat, to the truth that’s always been there, hidden behind the crowd.
