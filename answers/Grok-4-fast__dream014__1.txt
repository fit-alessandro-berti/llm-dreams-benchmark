You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you hesitate for a moment, your heart pounding like a distant drum in the neon haze. They smile with eyes that shimmer like fractured stars— a painter with paint-splattered overalls, a musician clutching a violin case that hums faintly, a baker whose apron smells of cinnamon and forgotten recipes. "Follow us," they say in unison, their voices weaving into a melody that tugs at the edges of your soul.

You do, stepping into an alley that wasn't there before, where the brick walls pulse with veins of liquid gold. The city warps around you: skyscrapers lean in like curious giants, whispering secrets in a language of rustling leaves and echoing laughter. The strangers lead you to a hidden square, a pocket of eternity blooming amid the chaos—a fountain that spits not water, but fireflies that swirl into shapes of your lost memories: a childhood swing set, a lover's handwritten note, the curve of a mountain path you once hiked at dawn.

As you sit on the fountain's edge, the painter sketches your portrait on the air itself, lines of color hanging like smoke. "You're not lost," the musician murmurs, drawing a bow across invisible strings that make the fireflies dance faster. "You're just on the way to the place where all paths meet." The baker presses a warm pastry into your hand—flaky, infinite, tasting of home—and suddenly, the square unfolds like a map in reverse. Streets unspool from your feet, leading not outward, but inward, to a quiet room at the city's heart where the walls are windows to every world you've ever dreamed.

You wake with the scent of cinnamon lingering on your fingertips, the fireflies still flickering behind your eyelids. The city outside your window hums on, but now it feels like an old friend, waiting for your next step.
