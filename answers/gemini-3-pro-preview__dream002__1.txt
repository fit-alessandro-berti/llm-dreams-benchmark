...the sky doesn't turn grey, but a deep, vibrating shade of violet. The air suddenly tastes like ozone and burnt sugar.

I look up, and the clouds aren't moving; they are boiling, churning like thick oil. Instead of thunder, a sound echoes through the trees—the sound of a thousand heavy doors slamming shut, one after another.

The rain begins, but it isn’t water. It is gravity. Heavy, visible distortions drop from the sky, and where they hit the ground, the earth dips and warps. A drop lands on a fern next to me, and the plant instantly flattens into a two-dimensional drawing of itself.

I try to run, but my legs feel like they are submerged in molasses. The trees around me begin to unroot themselves, pulling their feet from the soil to march away from the storm. They have human faces in their bark now, and they are all whispering, *"Hurry, the page is turning."*

I spot a small wooden cabin in the distance that wasn't there a moment ago. It is floating three feet off the ground. I swim through the heavy air toward it, grabbing the doorknob. The knob is an eyeball, and it blinks at me before the door swings open.

Inside, it is not a cabin, but a vast, endless library with no ceiling, snow falling gently between the bookshelves. I step inside, and the storm outside instantly turns into the sound of a cello playing a low, sad note. I look down at my hands, but they are made of stained glass.

I realize I am safe, but I have forgotten my name.
