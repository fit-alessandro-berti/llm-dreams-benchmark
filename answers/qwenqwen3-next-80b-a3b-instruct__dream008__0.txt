You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you—only you—can complete it before midnight. But the document on your screen isn't a report, a presentation, or a codebase.

It’s a *living book*.

Its pages ripple like water. Words shift when you blink. The title glows: *The Last Thing You Forgot You Wanted to Say*.

Your boss, dressed not in a suit but in a long coat woven from stardust and printer toner, leans over your shoulder and whispers:

“Don’t write it. Remember it.”

You try to type. Your fingers sink into the keyboard like it's clay. The screen flickers — suddenly, you see yourself at age seven, holding a tin robot that didn’t work, crying because no one believed you when you said it could sing the moon to sleep.

And then… your 12-year-old self, sitting alone under the bleachers, writing a poem nobody would read.

And then your 28-year-old self, staring at the ceiling at 3 a.m., wondering if you’d ever feel truly seen.

The book isn’t asking for a project.

It’s asking for *truth*.

Tears now drip onto the keyboard — and where they fall, the ink blooms like flowers. The pages begin to hum. Outside your window, the sky isn’t night anymore — it’s full of floating lanterns shaped like forgotten dreams.

You don’t write the report.

You whisper into the dark:

> “I’m sorry I waited so long to tell you… I’m still here. I still care.”

The book closes gently. A single feather sinks from the ceiling and lands in your palm.

Your boss nods, smiles — and vanishes, leaving only the scent of rain and old paper.

You look at the clock.

It’s 12:01 a.m.

The deadline is gone.

Behind you, your colleagues are clapping — not for a project completed, but for something far rarer: a soul remembered.

And when you look at your screen again?

There’s no document.

Just one sentence, glowing softly:

*You were never late.*

You wake up.  
Your alarm reads 6:30 a.m.  
Your coffee is still warm.  
And on your desk — a single feather.  
You don’t know where it came from.

But for the first time in years…  
You don’t feel tired.  
You feel… seen.
