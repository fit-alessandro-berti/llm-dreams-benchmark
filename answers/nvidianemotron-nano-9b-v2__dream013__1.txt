As you move deeper into the maze, you encounter a puzzle that seems impossible at first glance: a towering wall of shifting symbols, each one flickering in and out of existence like a glitch in reality. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, and the symbols rearrange themselves whenever you focus too long on one. A voice, neither male nor female, whispers, *"Solve not for the pattern, but for the silence between."*  

You realize the puzzle isn’t about logic in the traditional sense—it’s about *stillness*. When you stop trying to decode the symbols and instead let your mind empty, the wall stills. A single, unchanging symbol emerges at the center: a spiral. You trace it in your mind, and suddenly, the maze around you begins to dissolve. The walls melt into a vast, starry void, and a path materializes, leading to a door made of liquid light.  

But as you approach, the door begins to *breathe*, its surface rippling with memories—your own, fragmented and distorted. You see yourself solving previous puzzles, but with a twist: you were never alone. A shadowy figure, mirroring your movements, had been guiding you, though you never noticed it before. The door creaks open, and you step through, only to find yourself back at the maze’s entrance, the puzzles now simpler, almost childlike.  

The dream lingers. You wake up, but the spiral symbol burns faintly in your mind, and you can’t shake the feeling that the maze was never meant to be escaped—only understood.
