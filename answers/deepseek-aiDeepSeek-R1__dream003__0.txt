**Dream Continuation:**

As you trace your fingers over the swirling patterns, the carvings shift beneath your touch, alive with a faint golden glow. The box hums, resonating with a frequency that vibrates in your bones. Suddenly, the lid clicks open, releasing a plume of shimmering mist that smells of ancient parchment and starfire. Inside lies a prism-shaped crystal, pulsing with inner light. When you lift it, the room dissolves—walls melting into a twilight forest where trees whisper in forgotten tongues.  

A path of silvered stones appears, leading to a mirror-lake. Your reflection isn’t your own: it’s a stranger with your eyes, holding a key forged from starlight. “To return, you must lose,” they say, their voice echoing from all directions. But as you reach for the key, the ground trembles, and—  

**You wake** with a gasp, your palm clenched around something cold. A tiny iron locket rests there, etched with the same patterns as the box. Inside, a faded photo of a child you don’t recognize… but their smile feels achingly familiar. On the back, a single word: *Remember*.  

And beneath your pillow—a faint shimmer, like the ghost of a keyhole shaped like a heart.
