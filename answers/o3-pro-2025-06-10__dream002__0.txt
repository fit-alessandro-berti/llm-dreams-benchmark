and the sky bruises to a deep violet. The treetops sway, shedding leaves like startled birds, and a low rumble rolls across the canopy. A single drop of rain lands on your forehead—icy, impossibly heavy—followed by another, then a thousand more, until the forest floor becomes a drum.

Lightning splits the sky. In the flash, you notice a narrow path that hadn’t been there before, its stones glistening like silver scales. Something—half invitation, half warning—pulls you toward it. You step onto the path, and with each footfall the sound of the storm dims, as though the air itself muffles the thunder out of courtesy.

The path leads to a clearing encircled by colossal oaks. In the center stands a weather-worn wooden doorframe with no walls attached—just a door suspended in emptiness. Carved into the lintel are symbols you somehow understand: “Knock, and the storm becomes song.”

You knock. The door swings inward, revealing not a room but a coastline beneath a luminous dusk. The ocean is calm, yet the storm you left behind rages above it, contained within a glass dome that floats just offshore like a captured tempest. Rain lashes the inside of the dome, lightning ricochets across its surface, but the sea outside remains mirror-smooth.

You step through. Sand cools your feet. The scent of salt replaces the ozone tang of the forest storm. As you watch, the glass dome contracts, shrinking the storm into a fist-sized orb of swirling cloud and spark. A gull swoops down, catches the orb in its beak, and drops it at your feet. It becomes a translucent sphere, humming softly.

Instinct tells you to lift it. The moment you do, the sphere dissolves, seeping into your palms like warm water. A hush falls; even the waves pause. Inside your chest, you feel the storm settle—a new heartbeat, electric and steady. You realize it isn’t rage or chaos you’re holding; it’s power, potential, the very energy that turns seeds into forests and silence into symphonies.

The sea resumes its rhythm, and distant stars flicker on. Somewhere behind you the doorframe creaks, ready to lead elsewhere. You understand that every threshold you cross will offer another storm to be gathered, another song to be learned. With the sky opening above like a curtain of silver threads, you take a breath that tastes of rain and starlight, and you wake—hand still tingling, heart quietly thundering—certain that some part of the dream has followed you home.
