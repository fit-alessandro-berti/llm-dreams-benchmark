**Dream Continuation:**  

You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you bark a command to secure the ship, your voice cutting through the howling gales. *"Hatches fasten! Anchors down—now!"* The crew scrambles, hands trembling, as the waves surge over the bow. A massive wave crashes against the hull, sending splinters flying. The ship groans under the strain, listing dangerously to port. *"Keep the crew below!"* you shout, your heart pounding as another wave looms. With seconds to spare, you slam the helm hard to starboard, veering sharply away from the oncoming wave. The ship shudders but holds.  

As the storm rages on, you spot a faint light ahead—a narrow channel through the tempest. *"To port!"* you cry, guiding the ship through the storm’s fury. The crew’s exhausted cheers ripple through the deck as dawn breaks, the sea calm once more. You stand at the helm, your crew’s trust in you unshaken, the storm’s fury now a distant memory. In the quiet aftermath, a young sailor whispers, *"Captain… what if we’d stayed?"* You smile faintly, knowing some storms leave scars that only courage can mend.
