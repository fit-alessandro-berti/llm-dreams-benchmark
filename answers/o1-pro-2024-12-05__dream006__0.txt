…speak, but the words catch in your throat. For a moment, silence settles over the room, thick and tense. Then you notice something peculiar: no one in the audience seems impatient. Instead, they lean forward, as if they understand the weight of what you’re about to say and are willing to grant you all the time you need.

You look down at your prepared notes, only to find that the pages have turned blank—completely smooth and empty, as though they were never written upon. You try to recall your speech, but the outline in your mind feels slippery, dissolving like ink in water. Panic flutters in your chest, yet somehow you sense that this moment is more important than any carefully crafted words could have been.

A spotlight warms your face, and beyond its brightness you see familiar and unfamiliar figures: a childhood friend who moved away decades ago, a mentor you admired but never truly met, and countless strangers who seem to know your story. Your heart begins to slow. The silence feels more like a companion now, urging you to trust something deeper than your memory. So you begin speaking—not from the script you lost, but from a place of honest yearning. You talk about the dreams you once held and the ones you still nurture. You describe the fears that have trailed you and the hopes that have carried you forward. Each sentence emerges gently, like a fragile secret drifting out into candlelit darkness.

As your voice settles into a steady rhythm, you notice that the audience isn’t static. Figures transform and blend: the person in the third row grows wings of iridescent feathers and rises a few inches above their seat; someone near the back stands tall, then dissolves into a swirl of autumn leaves caught in a faint breeze; a small cluster of listeners become silhouettes against a starry night sky now visible at the edges of the theater’s walls. Everything is at once whimsical and profoundly comforting. You realize that this crowd isn’t here to judge you. They have come to witness your honesty, to see if the story you share aligns with the quiet truths they hold inside themselves.

Your words form patterns in the air—unseen shapes, gently glowing. And as these shapes drift upward, the ceiling of the room recedes, revealing an endless open field of constellations. The people, the stage, the microphone stand: all remain grounded beneath that spacious cosmic dome. You keep talking, and though you can’t recall the exact phrases, the content feels true, healing even. Tears come, not out of sadness, but because the moment seems to stretch across lifetimes.

When you finally finish, there is no applause. Instead, every being present breathes in at the same time, absorbing what you’ve shared and exhaling a tender hush that settles over you like a warm embrace. With that, the lights fade, the silhouettes and winged listeners and swirling leaves melt into a quiet, star-filled horizon. You step down from the stage, your heart still full, and slowly wake up—holding onto the gentle assurance that truth, spoken honestly, can find its own language without the need for scripted pages.
