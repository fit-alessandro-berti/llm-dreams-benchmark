You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and …  

The music swells into a low, reverberating thrum that feels more like a pulse than a beat, and the room stretches out in impossible geometry—walls of glass that reflect not your image but fragments of memories you didn’t know you owned. The first cluster you stumble upon is a circle of people wearing masks made of stained‑glass shards. Each mask is a different season: the crisp green of spring, the amber amber of autumn, the blank white of winter, the deep violet of midnight summer. When one of them turns toward you, the eye‑holes are empty pools of liquid mercury that ripple whenever you blink. They smile—though there are no lips—and hand you a small, translucent leaf that hums when you press it to your ear. The leaf whispers the name of the person you’re looking for, but the syllables shift each time you try to hold onto them, slipping like water through fingers.

You move on, and the next group is gathered around a long table made of polished river stones. They are all speaking in perfect unison, reciting a poem that seems to be written in a language of colors rather than words. Each line manifests as a cascade of light that spills across the floor, forming fleeting shapes—a soaring gull, a blooming lotus, a pair of intertwined vines—before dissolving again. The leader of this troupe, a man with a crown of woven copper wire, lifts his hand and points directly at you. As his finger touches your shoulder, a soft vibration spreads through you, and suddenly you’re filled with the sensation of being both everywhere and nowhere at once. In that moment, you glimpse a flicker of your friend’s silhouette, but it’s not a clear reflection; it’s a silhouette of pure curiosity, eyes wide with a question you can’t yet hear.

Further down the hall, an alcove glows with a gentle, amber light. Inside, a group of people are engaged in an activity that looks like they’re assembling a giant kaleidoscope with their hands. Each piece they place is an ordinary object—buttons, feathers, shards of broken mirrors—yet when they fit together, they create a swirling sea of patterns that pulse with a strange, familiar rhythm. The pattern that seems to resonate most with you is a series of interlocking circles that form a tiny, perfect map. On that map, a single red dot marks a spot that feels oddly familiar, like the corner of a favorite bookshop or the exact spot where you first tasted something sweet as a child. Your heart quickens; perhaps that red dot is where you’ll find the one person you know.

You push through the crowd, your feet moving with a calm certainty that seems at odds with the disorienting surroundings. As you turn a corner, you find yourself in a vast atrium filled with floating lanterns. Each lantern is a miniature universe, glowing with its own miniature constellations. Some lanterns are tethered to the ground with thin, silver cords; others drift freely, spinning lazily. Among them, one lantern glows a soft, familiar teal—a hue you recognize from the scarf your friend always wears. It hovers just above a low table where a single figure sits, knees drawn up, engrossed in sketching something on a large sheet of parchment. The figure’s hand moves fluidly, drawing lines that morph into tiny, living things—birds that flutter, trees that sway, a tiny house that opens its windows to let out a warm, amber glow.

You step closer, the crowd parting without a word, as if the very air respects the intention of your search. When you finally stand beside the sketcher, you see that it’s indeed the person you’ve been looking for. Their eyes are fixed on the drawing, but they pause, sensing your presence. Their head turns slowly, and a smile spreads across their face—a smile that feels like a sunrise after a long night. They look up, and for a brief, crystalline second, you both recognize each other not by name or circumstance, but by the shared awareness that you’ve both been wandering through a dreamscape that has been mapping out your inner pathways all along.

The room seems to exhale. The music softens, the humming leaves turn to gentle breezes, and the lanterns merge into a single, radiant sphere of light that hovers above the central table. As the glow expands, it paints the entire gathering in warm gold, and the people around you begin to dissolve into it, each one returning to their own story, leaving only the two of you—still standing, still breathing—within the circle of light. In that perfect pause, you realize that every group you encountered was not a distraction but a stepping stone, a reflected piece of yourself leading you to this moment of recognition.

And then, as the light settles, you both step together toward the edge of the gathering, where a narrow doorway opens onto a quiet, moonlit garden. The garden is simple: a stone path lined with lavender, a pond that reflects the conststellations above, and a bench positioned just beside the water’s edge. You sit, side by side, and the dream begins to soften at the edges, as if the world outside the dream is gently nudging you back to waking. Yet the sensations remain vivid—the coolness of the stones, the faint scent of night-blooming jasmine, the steady rhythm of your companion’s breathing beside you—serving as an unspoken promise that whatever comes next, you will carry this shared, luminous connection forward, wherever it may lead. 

The dream fades, but the echo of that harmonious hum lingers, a quiet reminder that even in the most bewildering of crowds, the thread that ties us to those we love can always be found—sometimes in the most unexpected of places.
