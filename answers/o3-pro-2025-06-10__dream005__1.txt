and each cluster seems to exist in its own pocket of reality.

1. The Polite Astronomers  
   You first drift toward a semicircle of guests dressed in evening wear spangled with tiny LED constellations. They speak in slow orbits of conversation, words revolving around a single topic: “Did you see it yet?” No one ever says what “it” is. Their champagne flutes contain miniature galaxies that swirl when tilted. You laugh politely and excuse yourself, but a woman presses a glittering marble into your palm and whispers, “In case you need another sky.”

2. The Library Ballroom  
   The next room is simultaneously a dance floor and a quiet reading hall. Couples waltz between shelves that extend upward into hazy skylight. When the dancers dip, the books bow too, their pages fluttering like fans. You pull a volume at random; every page contains the same sentence: “You are getting closer.” The letters rearrange each time you blink. A librarian in tap shoes stamps your wrist with an invisible ink stamp that feels warm and seems to hum.

3. The Cardboard Philosophers  
   Down a hallway that smells faintly of crayons, you find people wearing cardboard masks of famous thinkers—Plato, Simone de Beauvoir, Ada Lovelace. Their dialogue is half debate, half puppet show. When you ask if they’ve seen your friend, all the masks turn toward you. Plato’s eyes are two cut-out circles of darkness. In perfect unison they answer, “Everyone here is your friend.” A stagehand lowers a moon made of packing peanuts, and the scene goes dark except for your glowing wrist stamp, now showing a faint arrow. You follow it.

4. The Orchard Atrium  
   You step into a glass atrium filled with full-grown fruit trees whose roots dangle above the floor, held up by translucent threads. Partygoers pluck floating apples, pears, even small planets that taste like citrus and snowfall. A child offers you a seed shaped like a compass. When you hold it up, the seed spins and points toward a spiral staircase made of braided ribbons.

5. The Quiet Rooftop  
   Climbing feels effortless, almost upward swimming. You emerge onto a rooftop garden under a violet twilight sky. The single person you know—finally—leans against the railing, but their outline flickers like an old film. They’re watching paper lanterns lift off, each carrying a tiny mirror. You call their name; your voice sounds like two voices overlapping. They turn, smile, and hand you a lantern with your own face reflected inside the mirror.

   “I’ve been everywhere you looked,” they say, words echoing as though spoken inside a seashell. “You just had to catch up.”

   Together, you release the lantern. It rises, reflecting countless miniature versions of the party below—constellations, books, cardboard masks, floating trees—all compressing into a single, glowing marble.

   You open your hand: the original marble the astronomer gave you is gone. In its place is the invisible stamp from the librarian, now visible and reading, “You’re already here.” The rooftop dissolves into dawn light.

You wake up holding absolutely nothing—except, perhaps, another sky.
