(I take a deep breath, squinting into the driving rain that's stinging my face)

"Alright, crew! We need to drop anchor and ride out this storm! The winds are too strong, and the waves are getting treacherous. Chart a course to head into the wind, and let's hope the anchor holds! We don't want to get blown off course and risk running aground or worse."

I shout orders at the top of my lungs, straining to be heard over the howling wind and crashing waves. My crew scurries to obey, struggling to maintain their footing on the slick deck.

As I scan the horizon, I spot a wall of towering waves approaching our port side. My heart skips a beat. "Get ready to take the waves on board! Everyone hold on to something secure!"

The massive waves slam into us, threatening to capsize the ship. I cling to the steering wheel for dear life, my knuckles white with tension. The ship lurches and creaks under the force of the water, but I manage to keep her steady.

Somehow, we make it through the worst of the waves. As I glance around, I spot one of my sailors clinging to the railing, half-drowned and battered by the sea. I jump to his side and help him back to his feet, bellowing orders to get him something to tie off to.

As the storm rages on, I spot a dark shape looming through the rain-soaked air... a massive iceberg, jagged and glinting with frost. "Change course, NOW!" I bellow. "We don't dare risk collision!"

The ship shudders and groans as we turn hard to starboard, narrowly avoiding the iceberg's deadly reach. For a moment, I breathe a sigh of relief, thinking we've narrowly escaped disaster...

But the storm is far from over. Another fierce wave comes crashing over the gunwale, and we slide down the wave's face with a terrifying squeal of wooden planks. My dreamscape dissolves into chaos...
