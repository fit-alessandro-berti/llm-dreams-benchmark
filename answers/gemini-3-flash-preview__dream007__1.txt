...decide to stop fighting with words and instead reach into the air between you, grabbing the jagged, red sparks of your anger as if they were solid glass.

As your fingers close around the heat of the argument, the ground beneath your feet begins to soften, turning into a vast, shimmering mirror. Your friend’s face, contorted with frustration, starts to blur and melt like watercolor in the rain, their voice transforming from sharp accusations into the low, rhythmic hum of a distant cello.

You realize that the "important thing" you are fighting over isn't a secret or a mistake—it’s a physical weight. You reach into your chest and pull out a heavy, iron key that has been pulse-beating against your ribs. Your friend reaches into their own chest and pulls out a matching lock made of ice.

Without saying another word, you step across the rippling mirror of the floor and press the key into the lock. 

The moment they meet, there is no sound of clicking metal, only the sudden, overwhelming scent of ozone and lilies. The room around you—the walls of the house, the furniture, the ceiling—simply evaporates, leaving the two of you floating in a violet nebula. The anger dissolves into a profound, heavy silence. You look at your friend, whose eyes are now glowing like soft lanterns, and you realize that the argument wasn't about being right; it was the only way your souls knew how to bridge the distance between you.

As you drift further into the purple clouds, you feel your body becoming lighter than breath, and the last thing you hear is your friend’s laughter, echoing not from their mouth, but from the stars themselves.
