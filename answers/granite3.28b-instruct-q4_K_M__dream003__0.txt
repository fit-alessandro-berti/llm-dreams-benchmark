Engravings on its surface. The engravings seem to form a puzzle, a series of symbols arranged in an elaborate sequence. Intrigued, you study them intently, your mind racing to decipher their meaning. A cold breeze brushes against your skin, signaling a shift in the dreamscape. 

Suddenly, the box begins to levitate, hovering just above your hands, beams of ethereal light emanating from beneath it. The patterns on its surface start to pulse and glow, transforming into an interactive holographic puzzle, responding to your touch when you reach out cautiously. 

With a focused resolve, you manipulate the symbols, rotating, sliding them according to some unseen logic. The hum of energy in the room intensifies. After what feels like hours, the last symbol snaps into place with an audible click. 

The box descends softly back onto your palms. It vibrates gently for a moment before the locks disintegrating with a swirl of shimmering light. The lid creaks open, revealing a halo of radiant energy inside. As you lean closer to investigate, the light envelops you in a flash, and you're suddenly awakened by the first rays of dawn penetrating your window. 

In your dream-state hands remains the warm imprint of the vanished box, with the memory of the holographic puzzle and the mystic energy still lingering in your mind. You reach out to touch the spot where it was, expecting resistance, but your fingers meet nothing but air, leaving you with a rush of curiosity, excitement, and a profound sense of having unlocked a secret door to an unknown realm.
