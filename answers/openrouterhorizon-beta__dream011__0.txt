…written in a language you’ve never seen before—curving glyphs that shimmer as if they’re underwater. When you blink, they rearrange into shapes you almost recognize, like maps of cities you’ve never visited but somehow remember from childhood. Your pencil turns soft in your hand, like warm wax, and when you press it to the paper it draws music instead of words: a single staff line unfurling with notes that sound like footsteps in snow.

Around you, the other students flip pages with confidence, their heads bowed, but their faces blur when you try to look directly at them. The clock on the wall ticks, then begins to ripple, its hands melting and reforming as birds that fly in circles. The proctor—whose face is your own face, only older—walks the aisle without touching the ground, each footfall leaving a small silver puddle that reflects the sky.

You decide to answer anyway. The first question asks you to measure the weight of a promise. You place your memories on one side of an invisible scale: your first bicycle, your mother’s laugh, the way rain sounds in the attic. On the other side, the word “always.” The scale hovers, unsure, and then balances at “maybe.” You circle “maybe” and the mark glows.

The second question is a blank window that you need to open with a word you don’t know. You lean close and fog the glass with your breath; letters appear in the mist: try. You write try, and the window swings out onto a landscape that is both desert and ocean. Sand swells into waves. Fish drift through dunes. A lighthouse blinks from beneath the surface, patient as an eyelid.

Pages turn themselves. The third question is a photograph of a door you’ve passed a thousand times without noticing. Where does this door lead? it asks. You can hear laughter behind it, and also the hush of wind through pine. You write: It leads to the place that forgives me. The door on the paper opens a crack. You smell oranges, fresh cut wood, the warm static of summer.

Time is almost over; the clock is a nest of birds, and they are singing softly, their songs clipping off the last seconds. The final question simply says: Who are you when no one is watching? Your hand hesitates. All the room’s air seems to lean toward the page. You think of the thin quiet just before a storm arrives, of how your shadow stays with you even when you run, of the way you sometimes wake with your name on your tongue and swallow it by instinct.

You write: I am the door and the hand and the hinge. I am the person who keeps trying.

The proctor—your older self—stops beside your desk and nods as if hearing a private melody. “Pencils down,” they say, but their voice is a gentle tide pulling back from shore. The exam papers lift and fold into white birds that circle the room once, twice, then pass through the ceiling as if it were the surface of a lake.

Outside, the lighthouse winks again from beneath the floor. You stand, expecting your legs to fail, but they know exactly where to go. When you reach the door from the photograph, it is already open. The hallway beyond is lit with a light that remembers you. As you step through, the clock-birds settle into your hair and sing you your name, and the exam—your future, your fear—becomes a soft, folded thing in your pocket, warm against your palm, like a note from a friend that says simply: You’re already on your way.
