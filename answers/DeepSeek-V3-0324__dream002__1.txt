the trees begin to sway violently as the wind howls through the leaves. The sky darkens in an instant, and a deep rumble of thunder shakes the ground beneath your feet. Lightning splits the sky, illuminating the forest in eerie flashes.

As you step inside, the storm’s fury fades behind you, replaced by an uncanny silence. The cabin is cozy, filled with strange trinkets and old books. A voice, soft yet commanding, speaks from the shadows:  

*"You’ve been expected."*  

What do you do next?
