…open your mouth, but instead of words, a single shimmering soap bubble drifts out and floats toward the ceiling lights. The audience gasps—all at once their chairs tilt back like blooming flowers, petals of red velvet unfolding until the crowd reclines, gazing up at the bubble as if it were a tiny moon.

You try again. This time a small flock of paper cranes spirals from your lips, each bird carrying a syllable you never had the chance to form. They wheel over the stunned spectators, scattering syllables that rain down like confetti. Wherever a syllable lands, it turns into a luminous idea—tiny glowing symbols that perch on shoulders and whisper inspiration into eager ears.

A warm breeze—impossible indoors—pushes gently against your back. You glance over your shoulder; the curtain behind you has morphed into a river of ink, letters streaming past in serpentine currents. Summoned by some instinct, you step backward and let the river swallow you to the knees. Ink clings cool around your legs, but instead of staining, it lifts you, buoyant. Suddenly you’re drifting above the stage, borne aloft on sentences you never wrote but somehow recognize.

From this height you see the auditorium’s ceiling dissolve, revealing a midnight sky threaded with constellations you’ve never studied but already understand. Each constellation sketches a key moment of every listener’s life: the decision they fear, the love they’ve postponed, the dream they mislaid. The paper cranes peg themselves to these starlit shapes, connecting dot to dot until the sky is crowded with stories.

You realize your true speech isn’t spoken; it’s a shared vision. So you reach into the river of ink and fling handfuls upward. The liquid becomes luminous dust that sticks to the stars, brightening every unresolved line in the constellations. Below, the crowd sits up, eyes widening as they watch their own futures expand, possibilities branching lightning-quick across the sky.

Your heart thunders—yet the fear you carried onto the stage has emptied out, replaced by a hush of certainty. You finally find your voice, and though the words are softer than a sigh, every person hears them as clearly as their own thoughts:

“Take the pen.”

Thousands of hands rise, catching invisible quills that drift down like feathers. The audience begins to write mid-air, sketching shimmering trails that weave together into one vast, collaborative tapestry of light.

And as dawn spills through the skylight that was never there before, you feel the stage tilt gently. Gravity loosens its hold, and you float with the others into the sunrise’s palette, each soul scribbling a path of color through the waking sky—until the dream folds like a page and you wake, the taste of ink still sweet on your tongue, your first real sentence of the day already forming in your mind.
