...feel a wave of relief wash over you as they gather around, their faces warm and open. A tall woman with silver-streaked hair and bright, knowing eyes takes the lead.

"Where are you trying to go?" she asks.

You open your mouth to answer, but realize you don't actually know. The destination is on the tip of your tongue — a place that feels deeply important, almost urgent — but the name dissolves like sugar on your tongue every time you try to speak it.

"That's okay," says a young man with paint-stained hands, smiling gently. "We know the way."

And somehow, you believe him.

They begin walking, and you fall into step with them. The city shifts as you move — streets rearranging themselves like shuffled cards, buildings breathing slowly in and out, their windows blinking like sleepy eyes. None of the strangers seem to notice. They're talking and laughing among themselves, occasionally glancing back to make sure you're still with them.

You pass through a market where vendors sell bottled memories and jars of evening light. A child hands you a small, folded paper crane that hums faintly in your palm. You tuck it into your pocket and feel it beating there, like a second heart.

The group turns down a narrow alley that opens — impossibly — onto a wide, golden field. The city is gone. The sky is the color of something you've never seen before, a shade between forgiveness and homecoming.

And there, at the center of the field, is a door. Just a door, standing alone, with no walls around it.

"This is where we leave you," the silver-haired woman says softly, squeezing your hand.

You turn to thank them, but they're already fading — not disappearing, exactly, but becoming part of the landscape, their laughter settling into the rustle of the grass, their kindness dissolving into the warm air itself.

You stand before the door. The paper crane in your pocket thrums urgently.

You reach for the handle, turn it, and step through into—

*a room you've always known.* Every detail is familiar — the light, the smell, the texture of the air — though you've never been here in your waking life. And you understand, with a certainty that fills you completely:

You were never lost. You were just taking the long way home.

The dream holds you there for one perfect, luminous moment — then gently lets you go.
