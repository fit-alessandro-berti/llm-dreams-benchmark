...symbols etched into its surface, shimmering faintly as if lit from within. The patterns seem almost familiar — like a language you've never learned but somehow *remember*.

You run your fingers along the engravings, and the metal is warm. Warmer than it should be. And as your fingertips trace a spiral near the corner, something extraordinary happens — the symbol glows gold beneath your touch, then fades.

*It responds to you.*

You begin tracing more deliberately. A crescent. A series of nested triangles. A wave pattern that repeats seven times. Each one ignites briefly under your skin, and you realize — this isn't a *lock*. It's a *conversation*. The box is asking you questions in the only language it knows, and your hands are somehow answering.

The air around you thickens. The room — if it ever was a room — begins to dissolve at its edges, replaced by something like deep ocean and deep sky simultaneously. Stars below your feet. Water above your head.

The final symbol is shaped like an open hand.

You press your entire palm flat against it.

The box doesn't *open* so much as it *exhales* — a long, warm breath, like something has been holding it for a very long time.

Inside, there is no treasure. No key. No map.

There is only a small mirror.

And in it, you don't see your face.

You see the face of someone who knows exactly what happens next.

You lean closer and—

*What do they say to you?*
