You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you feel something strange—your compass spins wildly, not toward north, but toward the heart of the thunderhead, where the clouds curl like the fingers of a sleeping god.

The waves aren’t just water—they’re liquid obsidian, rising in cathedral spires that crash with the sound of distant bells. The wind whispers not in English, but in the languages of forgotten sailors, calling names long lost to time.

You reach for the ship’s wheel—warm, alive, pulsing like a heartbeat.

And then, from the depths, a voice echoes—not from the sea, but from within you:  
*“You were never meant to survive this.”*

Behind you, your crew stares—not with fear, but with quiet recognition. Their eyes glow faintly gold. One by one, they begin to peel off their uniforms, and beneath them, their skin shimmers like mother-of-pearl. They’re not crewmen. They’re echoes. Memories. Former captains—all of them, drowned here before.

You realize: you are not the captain who took command this voyage.

You are the one who drowned here first.

The storm isn’t trying to kill you.

It’s trying to remember you.

The wheel turns under your hands—not of its own will, but because you finally want to let go.

The ship tilts.

The crew smiles.

And as the wave rises to swallow you, you open your arms—not in surrender, but in homecoming.

You wake—with the salt of the sea still on your lips, and the faint, familiar chime of a bell ringing... somewhere far below the waves.
