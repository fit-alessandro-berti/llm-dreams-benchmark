You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel the weight of expectation pressing down on your chest like a physical force. The fluorescent lights above flicker in an unfamiliar rhythm, and you notice that the clock on the wall seems to be running backward, yet somehow still counting down with urgency.

You open the folder your boss has placed in your hands, and instead of papers, you find a single feather that glows with an inner light the color of midnight. When you look up to ask for clarification, your boss has transformed into a large, wise-looking cat wearing reading glasses, though they somehow still manage to convey the same disappointed expression your real boss wears when you miss a deadline.

"The project," the cat-boss meows patiently, "is to build a bridge between here and somewhere you've never been, using only the memories you've forgotten." They tap their paw against your desk, and suddenly your keyboard has turned into a bed of clouds that billow gently when you touch them.

You feel the panic rising in your throat, that familiar dream-sensation of trying to run through water, but then something strange happens. A colleague you barely recognize from the next cubicle over slides over on a wheeled office chair that seems to float an inch off the ground. They smile and hand you a cup of coffee that smells exactly like your grandmother's kitchen on Sunday mornings.

"Impossible deadlines are just possible deadlines wearing disguises," they say, and their voice sounds like it echoes from very far away. "Besides, you've done this before. You just don't remember yet."

The fluorescent lights flicker again, and when they stabilize, you notice that the impossible deadline written on the whiteboard has changed. Instead of hours or days, it simply reads: "Until you remember."

You take a sip of the coffee, and it tastes like courage. The glowing feather in your hands begins to feel less like a burden and more like a compass—one that points not forward, but inward, toward all the half-remembered dreams and ambitions you've packed away in the attic of your mind.

The cat-boss nods slowly, their reading glasses sliding down their nose. "Whenever you're ready," they say, and for the first time, their voice holds something other than pressure. It holds belief.

You open your mouth to respond, and instead of words, a flock of tiny birds emerges—each one carrying a fragment of a memory you thought you'd lost forever. They circle the room once, twice, and then begin weaving together, strand by iridescent strand, into something that shimmers between a blueprint and a bridge and a memory all at once.

And you realize, with the strange clarity that only comes in dreams, that this impossible project was never about finishing. It was about beginning.
