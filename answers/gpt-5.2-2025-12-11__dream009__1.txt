You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **survive long enough to understand where—and when—you are**, and then decide what kind of person you’re going to be in a world that doesn’t know your name.

The air smells of smoke and wet earth. Your clothes are wrong for the season—whatever the season is—and the road beneath your feet is packed dirt, rutted by wheels and hooves. In the distance, a cluster of low buildings hunch under thatched roofs like animals keeping warm. A bell tolls once, then again, slow and heavy.

You walk toward it because walking away means woods, and woods mean hunger.

As you get closer, people turn to look. Not with curiosity exactly—more like calculation. Their clothes are coarse, patched. Their hands are busy. A woman carrying a basket of onions pauses just long enough to assess you, then keeps going. A boy with straw-colored hair trails behind you at a safe distance, fascinated by the fact that you’re alone.

A man steps into your path near a trough where horses drink. He has a thin beard and a thicker suspicion.

“Where are you from?” he asks.

Your mouth goes dry. The truth is a useless thing here. You can’t say “the future.” You can’t say “a city with lights.” You can’t say “I don’t know.”

You say the first half-truth that lands without breaking: “Far away.”

He squints like he’s measuring your vowels. “You got coin?”

You pat your pockets. There’s nothing. No phone. No wallet. No keys. No familiar weight. Only lint and the terrible quiet of being unanchored.

The man’s gaze flicks to your hands. Clean. Soft. Not a laborer’s hands. Not yet.

“Far away,” he repeats, and the word becomes an accusation. “And empty.”

He doesn’t strike you. That would be simple. Instead he tilts his head toward the largest building—timber-framed, smoke curling from its roof.

“Go to the inn,” he says. “Ask for work. If you sleep in the ditch and die, it’s not my concern.”

You thank him too quickly and walk on.

Inside the inn it’s dim and warm and smells of ale, boiled cabbage, and bodies. The room goes quiet in the way rooms do when everyone is trying not to stare.

A woman behind the counter watches you with the look of someone who has seen strangers become problems.

“You can sweep,” she says before you even speak. “You can scrub. You can haul. You don’t eat until you’ve done something worth feeding.”

You nod. “Yes.”

She tosses you a broom like she’s throwing you a lifeline she doesn’t fully trust. “Name?”

You hesitate. Your name feels like a bright modern thing—too crisp for this place. But it’s all you have that belongs to you.

You tell her.

She repeats it wrong, on purpose or by accident, and that’s the first thing you lose: the precise sound of who you are.

---

You work until your shoulders burn. You scrub benches, carry buckets, split kindling. The inn’s patrons stop watching you and start ignoring you, which is almost a relief.

In the corner, near the hearth, a one-eyed man is sharpening a knife with slow care. He’s dressed better than most, and the way people avoid him says more than his scar.

When you pass with an armful of wood, he speaks without looking up.

“You don’t belong here.”

You stop.

“Most people don’t,” you manage.

He lets out a small huff that could be laughter. “You’re not a runaway peasant. You’re not a pilgrim. Not a merchant. Not a soldier.” His blade catches the firelight. “So what are you?”

Your mind races through the possibilities like doors in a burning building. If you say the wrong thing, you could end up in chains or in a shallow grave.

“I’m…lost,” you say.

That earns you his attention. His one good eye fixes on you like a pin.

“Lost people make the best recruits,” he says. “Or the best corpses.”

You swallow. “Recruits for what?”

He gestures with his knife toward the window. Outside, the sky is bruising into evening, and you can hear it now beneath the inn’s noise: distant shouting, a clatter of hooves, the metallic bark of fear.

“Trouble,” he says simply.

The innkeeper slams a mug down. “Keep your mouth shut, Oren.”

Oren smiles as if he enjoys being told not to. “It’s coming either way.”

That night you sleep in a loft above the stables, in straw that pricks through your borrowed blanket. You dream of your old life—not as it was, but as a series of glowing rectangles: screens, windows, maps you used to summon without thinking. You reach for them in your sleep and wake with your hand grasping at air.

Below, a horse stamps and snorts.

Then you hear the real sound that pulls you fully awake: boots in the yard. Too many. Too organized.

A voice rises—authority wrapped in boredom. “By order of the lord’s reeve. Open.”

The innkeeper’s voice answers, sharp. “We’re closed.”

Wood cracks. Someone curses. The door gives.

You sit up, heart stuttering, and the straw shifts too loudly.

A lantern glow swells up through the slats of the loft. Shadows climb the walls like living things. Men’s voices, rough with drink or power.

“Search,” says the bored authority. “We’re looking for a man. One eye. Scar.”

Oren.

You freeze, listening. You can hear the knife-sharpener’s calm footsteps crossing the taproom like he’s walking out to greet a guest. You can also hear something else: a faint scrape near the ladder—someone starting up toward you.

You suddenly understand with cold clarity: you’re not just lost in time. You’re in a story that has already started, with factions and debts and names you don’t know. And whether you want it or not, you are about to be useful.

Because you’ve seen this pattern before—just not in real life.

A raider’s head appears at the top of the ladder, lantern light bleaching his face.

He looks up at you, blinks, and grins.

“Well,” he says softly, “what’s this?”

Your throat tightens.

Behind him, downstairs, Oren’s voice carries—smooth, almost amused.

“Tell your reeve,” Oren says, “that he should have sent more men.”

The lantern-bearer reaches for you.

And in that instant, your mind snaps into a plan as primitive as the world around you:

Not a phone call. Not a search engine. Not a panic button.

Just **fire, leverage, and a lie that sounds like it belongs here**.

You grab the nearest thing—dry straw, a flint striker hanging from a beam, a stub of candle you saw earlier—your hands moving with desperate certainty.

The man’s fingers close on your wrist.

You meet his eyes and say, with all the confidence you can counterfeit:

“Don’t touch me. I’m under protection.”

He pauses. “Whose?”

Downstairs, the first scream erupts—followed by the unmistakable crash of a table overturning, the thud of bodies colliding, the sharp roar of men who expected obedience and found teeth.

You tighten your grip on the candle stub and answer the question with the only name you can gamble on—because in a world like this, every fear has a face:

“The lord’s.”

The man hesitates just long enough for you to strike the flint.

Sparks jump.

Straw catches with a hungry whisper.

For a heartbeat, you’re terrified you’ve made the worst mistake possible.

Then the loft fills with orange light and smoke, and the man recoils, swearing, stumbling backward down the ladder.

Below, chaos blossoms.

And you realize the thing you need to do—more than eat, more than hide, more than find your way home—is this:

You need to **choose a side before someone chooses it for you**.

Because the past is not gentle.

And it has noticed you.
