**Dream Completion:**

You decide to shout your final point, but as the words leave your lips, they crystallize into glowing orbs of light. Startled, you both watch as the orbs float upward, weaving a luminous bridge across the starless sky. Your friend reaches out, their anger melting into wonder, and their rebuttal escapes as a cascade of indigo butterflies. The creatures flutter toward the bridge, their wings humming a melody you both recognize—an old song from a road trip years ago. 

Without speaking, you step onto the bridge, the light solid yet weightless beneath your feet. Your friend follows, and with each step, the argument fragments into whispers that dissolve like smoke. At the bridge’s peak, you find a door framed by ivy. Together, you turn the handle, and it opens to a sunlit meadow where two cups of steaming tea await, placed beside a chessboard. You sit, and the game begins—no winners, no losers, just the clink of pieces and the unspoken truth that some bonds are fortified by friction. 

When you wake, the details blur, but the scent of chamomile lingers.
