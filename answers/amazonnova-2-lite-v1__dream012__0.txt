### **You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you…**

…raise your voice above the howling wind, gripping the wheel with hands gone numb from cold and effort. Lightning splits the sky, illuminating the frantic faces of your crew—men and women whose eyes reflect a mixture of fear and trust. The ship groans beneath you, timbers creaking in protest as massive waves slam against the hull, threatening to tear it apart.

You knew this voyage would be perilous, but nothing could have prepared you for *this*.

“With me!” you bark, your voice steady despite the chaos. “Secure the sails! Reef them now! And someone get the pumps working—we’re taking on water fast!”

You glance up at the mainsail, now a fluttering mess as the wind tears at it like a beast. Two of your sailors nod, leaping into action, climbing the rigging with the desperation of those who know that hesitation means death.

But as you turn back to the wheel, you notice something strange—a glow in the water just ahead. It pulses, rhythmic and unnatural, like a heartbeat. The storm seems to coil around it, almost… *alive*.

You lean closer, squinting against the rain. The glow deepens, forming a spiral of light beneath the waves. A murmur spreads through the crew.

“What is that?” one whispers.

“Magic,” you mutter, though you’ve never believed in such things—until now.

Suddenly, a voice, soft yet unmistakable, echoes in your mind:

> *“Captain… you must choose. One path leads to destruction. The other… to revelation.”*

You falter. Revelation? In this hellscape? But you sense the truth in the words. The sea isn’t just a storm—it’s a trial.

You look at your crew. Young Eli, barely twenty, trembling but holding firm at the pump. Old Maren, her hands raw but still pulling rope like she’s fought storms for a century. They’ve followed you across oceans, through mutinies and scurvy, through calm and conflict. They trust you—not because you’re perfect, but because you’ve always led them forward.

You grip the wheel tighter.

“We chart a new course,” you declare. “Towards the light.”

A hush falls over the deck.

“Captain?” Eli asks, uncertainty cracking his voice.

“It’s our only chance,” you say, not taking your eyes off the pulsing glow. “If that light leads us to safety—or something more—then we take it. Prepare the ship for a sharp turn. And arm yourselves. I don’t know what waits beyond, but we face it *together*.”

As the crew scrambles to obey, you feel something strange—peace, amid the chaos. The storm rages, but your resolve is firmer than any mast.

And then, as if in answer, the glow beneath the waves pulses brighter.

The ship turns.

And the sea… begins to change.
