Okay, I'm *inside* this dream now... it feels porous, hazy, like the edges are dissolving...

You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and **carvings that seem to shimmer slightly, as if reflecting light that isn't actually there. They look like ancient symbols, maybe celestial maps, twisting around the box's surface.**

Then, something changes. A faint, rhythmic *hum* begins, not loud, but deep, vibrating through the box, making your fingers tingle where they rest on the wood. The patterns seem to *pulse* in time with it, growing brighter. You lift the box, feeling its peculiar weight – heavy, but strangely light at the same time.

As you hold it, the air in the dream space thickens, growing warmer. The box seems to *beckon* to you, its surface growing hotter. Without thinking, you press your thumb against the central, most complex pattern. There's a jolt, not painful, but electric, like static electricity multiplied a thousandfold. A seam, previously invisible, traces a circle just below the main designs, and the hum intensifies, becoming a low roar.

The lid suddenly *slides* upwards and backwards with a soft *thump*, revealing not treasure, but a deep void, swirling with nebula-like colors. From within, a single, perfect, iridescent feather floats up and settles on the box's opening. It seems to pulse with the same faint light as the patterns.

The dream feels less stable now, shifting, swirling around the box and the feather. The feather feels intensely important, but why...? The buzzing grows louder, pulling you...
