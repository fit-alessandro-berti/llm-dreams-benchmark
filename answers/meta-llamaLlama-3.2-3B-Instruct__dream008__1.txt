...felt my heart sink as I stared at the stack of papers on my desk. The project was titled "Revolutionary Spacecraft Design" and the deadline was in just two hours. I blinked, wondering if I was dreaming, but everything around me seemed too vivid, too real.

My boss, Mrs. Johnson, stood in the doorway, her arms crossed and a stern expression on her face. "Alright, team, let's get to work. We need to come up with a design for a spacecraft that can travel to Mars in under 30 days. It's a challenge, but I know we can do it."

I felt a wave of panic wash over me. 30 days was an impossible deadline. We'd never even started discussing the project, let alone had time to conduct feasibility studies or assemble a team. But before I could respond, Mrs. Johnson continued.

"You have one hour to brainstorm ideas. I want to see something on paper by the end of the hour. If we don't have a viable design, we'll be discussing a team-wide re-evaluation of our priorities."

The clock started ticking, and I frantically scanned my desk for any scraps of paper or whiteboard markers. I had to come up with something, anything, or risk facing Mrs. Johnson's wrath.

I grabbed a pen and started scribbling random ideas, hoping to spark some creativity. But as the minutes ticked by, my mind went blank. I felt like I was staring into a void, with no way out.

Just as I was about to give up, my computer screen flickered to life. I was browsing through a website that didn't seem familiar, but then I saw the words "Project Mars" on the screen. It was a company that claimed to have developed a revolutionary new propulsion system for interplanetary travel.

On a whim, I clicked on a link to learn more. The article claimed that the company had successfully tested their system and could potentially travel to Mars in under 30 days.

I looked up at the clock and saw that I had 10 minutes left. I quickly grabbed a piece of paper and started typing furiously, my ideas flowing like water. I sketched out a rough design for a spacecraft that utilized the company's propulsion system.

As the clock ticked down, I felt a sense of panic giving way to excitement. Maybe, just maybe, I had a chance to pull this off. I printed out my design and rushed to present it to Mrs. Johnson, hoping that it would be enough to impress her.

But as I entered the conference room, I saw something that made my heart skip a beat. Mrs. Johnson was no longer standing at the door, but instead was sitting at the head of the table, a smile on her face.

And then, just as I was about to present my design, the room began to distort and blur. I felt myself being pulled back into my own body, my vision fading to black. I woke up with a start, my heart racing, and my sheets drenched in sweat.

It was just a dream, I told myself. But the feeling of panic and excitement lingered, making me wonder... what if?
