As I try to find them, I encounter various groups of people and feel a growing sense of disorientation in the vast, echoing hall. The first group is a cluster of strangers in elaborate masks, laughing uproariously about colors that don't exist—purples that taste like rain, blues that whisper secrets. I try to ask if they've seen my friend, but my words come out as echoes, bouncing off the walls like forgotten memories. Moving on, I weave through another circle of people who seem fused together, their arms linked in an endless chain, debating the weight of dreams versus reality. One of them turns to me with eyes like swirling galaxies and says, "You're looking for a shadow in the light," before they all dissolve into a mist that clings to my skin.

Deeper into the gathering, the air grows thicker, filled with the scent of forgotten perfumes and distant music that plays backward. I spot a group of figures in vintage clothing, frozen mid-dance, their faces shifting from familiar to alien as I approach. One resembles my friend for a split second, but when I reach out, they shatter like glass, reforming into someone else entirely. Panic rises in my chest as the crowd swells, voices overlapping in a cacophony of whispers that sound like my own thoughts. Just as I'm about to give up, I push through a final throng and find my friend standing alone by a glowing doorway, their face calm and unchanging. We lock eyes, and in that moment, the dream unravels like frayed thread—I wake up, the gathering fading into the quiet of my room, leaving me wondering if I ever truly knew them at all.
