You are at a large social gathering, the kind where the air hums with a low, almost imperceptible buzz of conversation and the clinking of glasses.  The space is vast, a cavernous hall filled with flickering candlelight and a riot of colours – emerald velvet drapes, sapphire-blue tapestries, and gold-framed portraits staring down from the walls.  You're dressed in a shimmering, unfamiliar fabric, a shade of lavender that feels strangely familiar, like a forgotten dream.

You only know one person here:  Elias.  He's a tall man with eyes the colour of polished obsidian, and you recall a shared laughter over a whispered joke years ago, a laughter that still echoes softly in your memory.  You feel a peculiar mix of nervous anticipation and bittersweet longing.

As you weave through the throng, the voices blend into a chaotic symphony.  You encounter a group huddled around a long mahogany table, engaged in animated arguments about the merits of a forgotten musical instrument.  Their faces, illuminated by the candlelight, are a kaleidoscope of passionate expressions, yet you feel no connection.  Across the room, a woman in a flowing crimson gown is surrounded by a cluster of men, all of whom seem to be vying for her attention.  She smiles briefly, a sharp, knowing smile, and you feel a pang of envy, quickly followed by a wave of indifference.

You wander past a quartet playing a melancholic melody on antique stringed instruments. The music is hauntingly beautiful, and you find yourself drawn to its mournful tones.  It feels like a forgotten lullaby, a melody you vaguely remember from a life you've never lived.

A group of women are laughing, their voices a torrent of shared secrets and hushed whispers. They are dressed in flowing silks, their movements graceful, like dancers in a silent ballet.  You feel a prickling sensation on the back of your neck, a sense of being observed, of being watched by eyes you can't quite see.

You bump into someone, a man with a stern face and a monocle perched on his nose.  He's dressed in a tailored suit of somber grey, and he looks down at you with unimpressed eyes, muttering something about the "unseemly clutter" of the gathering.  You feel a sudden urge to disappear.

Then, you see him.  Elias. He's standing by a window, gazing out at a sprawling, moonlit landscape.  He's alone, bathed in the soft glow of the moonlight filtering through the glass.  He's not smiling, but there's a subtle warmth in his eyes, a recognition that makes your heart flutter.  As you approach, the room seems to fade away, the sounds of the gathering muted and distant.  The only thing that exists is the space between you, the shared history that binds you together. You reach out to him, and the last thing you remember before waking is the feel of his hand, surprisingly warm, in yours.
