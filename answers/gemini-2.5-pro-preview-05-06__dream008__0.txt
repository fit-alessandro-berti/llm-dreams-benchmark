...and you look down at your desk, but instead of your familiar computer and scattered notes, there's just a single, oversized, bright red button that says "START." It's pulsing with a faint, internal light.

Your boss, whose face now seems to be made of shifting digital code, glitches slightly and repeats, "The deadline... the deadline is *yesterday*!" His voice echoes, somehow both too loud and too quiet at the same time.

You reach for the red button, but your hand feels like it's moving through treacle. Your colleagues are all frozen mid-action: one is mid-sip from a coffee cup that's suspended in the air, tiny droplets hanging perfectly still; another is mid-laugh, mouth wide, but no sound emerges. Only you and your boss seem to be operating in this warped timeframe.

Finally, your finger makes contact with the button.

The moment you press it, the office walls dissolve into a swirling vortex of colors – every color imaginable, and some you're sure don't exist. You're floating, and the "project" materializes before you: it's a gigantic, tangled ball of yarn, each strand a different, shimmering hue, stretching off into infinity. Your task, you somehow understand without being told, is to untangle it and sort every strand by its exact shade and emotional resonance.

Your boss, now a disembodied, booming voice, intones, "The Cosmic Emotional Spectrum Re-Alignment. Due. Yesterday."

You sigh, a sound that seems to stretch for miles, and grab the nearest strand – a soft, lavender thread that hums with a gentle melancholy. As you pull, it begins to sing a lullaby, and suddenly, you're wearing incredibly comfortable pajamas made of the same lavender yarn, and the urge to just curl up and sleep amidst the cosmic tangle is overwhelming. But the red button is still there, hovering patiently beside you, now labelled "CONTINUE?"
