You are dreaming. Can you complete the following dream?

You are about to take the final exam for a course that that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are...?

...entirely based around building a perfect sandwich. No essays. Just diagrams, ingredient lists with ridiculously obscure options, and scales showing precise weight adjustments. "Optimal bread to filling ratio for existential contentment: Rank options A through F numerically." "The philosophical implications of mustard yellow compared to olive green in a deli setting: Argue your methodology." "You must design a sandwich that represents the peak of hope. Specify texture combinations, aroma profiles (with a provided organoleptics spectrum), and list the anticipated emotional reactions elicited within a test subject upon ingestion."

Panic bubbles up. You look around the crowded hall: fellow students furrowing their brows over charts illustrating cucumber slicing techniques, meticulously sketching the curl of a pepper segment. A woman across from you is using a specialized protractor to examine the angle of the potato chip pile. 

Then you notice, faintly shimmering behind your exam – another person. Sitting at an empty desk, he's building an *enormous* sandwich, easily the size of a small car. Each layer is intricately designed: shimmering geodes as decoration, vines of chocolate-sprinkled cream cheese woven between slices of what looks like obsidian rye. This mysterious builder isn’t concerned at all, radiating a profound, utterly tranquil sense of… culinary zen.

He raises a knowing eyebrow at you.

Suddenly, you understand! It's not *about* achieving some theoretical optimal sandwich; it's about the meticulous care, the individual choices, the bizarre artistry of creation. It's about building something completely unique and wonderfully nonsensical from a pile of disparate parts.


Your own sandwich begins to shape itself in your mind: Thick slabs of sour cherry sourdough, shimmering pink grapefruit pickle slices, smoky lavender-spiced chickpeas, and a single, perfectly balanced strawberry resting on top, glinting in the imaginary light. This isn't just a sandwich, it's a story, a moment held captive between two slices.

As you write “Strawberry, Symbolising Fleeting Joy” on your exam, the man across from you nods slowly and… disappears. The hall begins to melt down in an explosion of pickles and pumpernickel crusts as you feel lighter, unbound by the pressure. You giggle, realizing you just wrote a haiku entirely about a bagel.


And then you wake up. With the intense craving for a truly, utterly bizarre sandwich.
