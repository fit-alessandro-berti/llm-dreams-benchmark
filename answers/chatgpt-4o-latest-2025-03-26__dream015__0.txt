form a small community with fellow survivors, driven by a stubborn hope that things can still be rebuilt. You scout the shattered skyline for a place to settle and eventually find a half-collapsed library—overgrown with ivy but still standing strong. Something about its quiet persistence comforts you.

Inside, you and your group clear out the debris and make a temporary home among the forgotten books. At night, huddled around a fire made from broken chair legs and caution signs, someone opens a weathered survival manual—and then, someone else reads poetry. It becomes a ritual: strategy and survival by day, dreams and stories by night.
