**The Dream Continues…**

The patterns on the box shift like living ink—swirling, pulsing, as if breathing. You trace your fingers over the grooves, and suddenly, the metal grows warm beneath your touch. A whisper curls through the air, not from the box, but from *inside* you—a voice that isn’t yours, yet feels familiar.

*"Turn the lock with your name."*

You hesitate. The box has no visible keyhole, no dial, no mechanism at all. But as you press your palm against its surface, the patterns rearrange themselves into letters, forming a single word in a language you’ve never seen but somehow *understand*:

**"Speak."**

Your breath catches. The air hums with anticipation. You open your mouth, and—

—your own name spills out, but not as you know it. It’s deeper, older, woven with threads of something ancient. The moment the last syllable leaves your lips, the box *clicks*. A seam appears where none was before, splitting the lid with a sigh like wind through forgotten ruins.

Inside, there’s no treasure. No gold, no jewels. Just a single, perfect **feather**, black as midnight but shimmering with iridescent veins of blue and violet. It’s warm to the touch, and when you lift it, the world around you *tilts*.

The room dissolves. You’re standing in a vast, twilight sky, the horizon a gradient of bruised purples and molten gold. Below you, a city of spires made of bone and starlight stretches endlessly, its streets paved with echoes. The feather in your hand begins to glow, and the wind—no, *something* in the wind—whispers:

*"You’ve been here before. Not in waking. Not in dreams. But in the space between."*

A shadow detaches itself from the nearest spire. It’s a figure, tall and slender, its edges flickering like candle flame. It raises a hand, and the feather in your grip *lifts*, tugging you forward. You try to resist, but your body moves on its own, drawn toward the figure as if pulled by an invisible thread.

As you get closer, you realize it’s not a shadow at all. It’s a **mirror**—or rather, the reflection of *you*, but older, wilder, with eyes that hold entire galaxies. The reflection smiles, and its voice is the one you heard earlier:

*"You’ve been searching for the key, but the lock was never the box. It was you."*

The feather burns brighter. The city fades. And then—

**You wake up.**

Your hand is empty. The box is gone. But on your pillow, where your head rested, lies a single black feather, still warm.

And somewhere, far away, a door you didn’t know existed *creaks open*.

**What do you do next?**
(Do you follow the feather’s pull? Try to find the box again? Or ignore it all and go back to sleep—knowing the dream will return?)
