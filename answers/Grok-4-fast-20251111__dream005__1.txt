each group seems to pull you into their orbit, like invisible threads woven from laughter and half-heard secrets. The first circle is a cluster of artists, their hands stained with midnight-blue paint that drips like liquid stars onto the marble floor. They're debating the shape of infinity—whether it's a Möbius strip or a fractal hidden in a nautilus shell—and one of them, a woman with eyes like fractured prisms, presses a brush into your palm. "Paint the edge of tomorrow," she whispers, and suddenly you're stroking colors across the air, watching them bloom into hovering galaxies that pulse with your heartbeat. But the colors taste like regret, sour on your tongue, and you slip away, leaving a trail of comet tails in your wake.

Deeper into the throng, you stumble upon the philosophers, huddled around a flickering campfire that burns without wood or smoke. They're ancient souls in modern suits, quoting forgotten poets in languages that shift like sand dunes. A bearded man with a laugh like rolling thunder claps your shoulder and asks, "What is the sound of one hand waving goodbye?" You open your mouth to reply, but the words dissolve into fireflies that dart upward, illuminating faces etched with questions older than time. The warmth lures you closer, but it singes the edges of your resolve, and you excuse yourself with a nod, the fireflies trailing you like lost thoughts.

The music swells then, a symphony of strings and synths that vibrates through the chandeliers, drawing you toward the dancers. They're a whirlwind of silk and shadow, twirling in patterns that defy gravity—waltzing on tiptoe across the ceiling, their feet leaving footprints of frost on the vaulted dome. A partner materializes at your side, ethereal and familiar, with hair like spun moonlight and a smile that promises forgotten adventures. "Dance with me," they say, voice a melody of wind chimes, and you do, spinning through loops of time where yesterday's regrets pirouette into tomorrow's hopes. Your bodies move as one, weightless, until the rhythm fractures, and you're falling—not crashing, but floating—into a sea of confetti that whispers your name.

At last, you spot your one known face across the room: they're laughing with a group of stargazers, telescopes propped like canes against velvet couches. But as you weave toward them, the crowd parts like a dream dissolving at dawn, and the room folds inward. The artists' paint swirls into the philosophers' fire, the dancers' frost melting into starlight. Your friend turns, eyes wide with recognition, but their voice echoes from afar: "You've been here all along." And just as you reach out, the gathering blurs into a single, infinite breath—you wake, or do you? The echo lingers: what if the dream is the gathering, and you're still searching?
