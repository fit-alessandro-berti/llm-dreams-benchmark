…keep going.

At first it's out of pure stubbornness: a refuse to let the world end with you huddled in the dark. You scavenge an abandoned greenhouse on the edge of the ruined city and begin coaxing life back into cracked soil with saved seeds and rainwater. Each sprout feels like a small act of defiance against the ash and rust.

Word travels. One morning, as you haul a jury‑rigged solar panel into place, a silhouette appears on the horizon. Then another. Other wanderers have heard about a place where a stubborn dreamer is planting things that grow. You band together, sharing what you know, stringing up wind chimes to warn of danger, painting bright colors on the walls to remind yourselves of the old world.

The dangers don't vanish — you still have to skirt crumbling towers and avoid the creatures that stalk the empty highways — but with every new leaf and every shared meal, the apocalypse feels a little less final. In the cool of evening, under a sky finally clear enough to show the stars, you realize that even in a broken world, you can choose to build, to nurture, to hope. As the dream blurs and fades, that feeling is the last thing you hold on to.
