feel a wave of energy wash over you. The lights above seem impossibly bright, casting long shadows across the stage as your footsteps echo softly against the wooden floor. You glance down at your notes in your hands, but they blur before your eyes—words dissolving into meaningless shapes. 

The audience waits silently, their anticipation hanging heavy in the air like an unspoken question. For a moment, everything feels surreal, as though this isn't real, as though you're floating just outside yourself, watching this scene unfold from some distant vantage point.

Then, something strange happens. As you take another step forward toward the podium, the crowd begins to shift and change. Faces blur together, morphing into unfamiliar forms—some human, others not quite so. A man with antlers peers out from the front row, his eyes glowing faintly. Beside him sits a figure cloaked entirely in shadow, its form indistinct yet somehow commanding attention. Further back, a woman with feathers for hair smiles serenely, her gaze steady and unwavering.

Your heart quickens, but instead of fear, a strange calm settles over you. This is no ordinary crowd; these are beings who have traveled from far-off realms, gathered here to hear what you have to say. Whatever words were once written on your notes no longer matter—they wouldn’t suffice for this gathering anyway. Instead, you realize that the speech must come from within, raw and unfiltered.

You place your hands on the edge of the podium and look out at the sea of extraordinary faces. Taking a deep breath, you begin to speak—not with rehearsed phrases or practiced eloquence, but with a voice that seems to rise up from somewhere deep inside you, ancient and resonant. Your words ripple outward, filling the room with meaning that transcends language, painting vivid pictures of worlds unseen and truths untold.

And as you speak, the boundaries between reality and imagination blur further. The stage becomes a threshold, a doorway through which both you and your audience step, leaving behind the mundane world to journey together into the unknown.
