As I wandered through the gathering, my heart quickened with anticipation. The air buzzed with familiar faces—laughter, clinking glasses, and the warmth of shared stories. Yet, as I looked around, I felt the weight of my isolation. The person I knew was not among them, and I couldn’t place them. Each group of people made me wonder: what was the reason they had so much to reveal? Could I still connect without them? I smiled faintly, my voice a low hum. *"Maybe I've always known them beyond these gatherings,"* I whispered, a hint of a truth hidden inside. And as I stepped away, the shadows of faces around me began to fade, like light and sound.
