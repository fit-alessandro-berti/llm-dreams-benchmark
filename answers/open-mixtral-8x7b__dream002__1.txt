the sky quickly darkens, with thunder rumbling in the distance. The wind picks up, rustling the leaves and causing branches to creak ominously. You start to run, seeking shelter, as large raindrops begin to fall, quickly turning into a torrential downpour.

As you continue to run, a bolt of lightning strikes nearby, illuminating the path ahead. You see a small cave up ahead and make a dash for it, just as the heavens open up and dump a deluge of water.

Once inside the cave, you catch your breath and watch as the storm rages outside. The sound of the rain on the cave roof is soothing, and you start to feel a sense of peace and calm.

As the storm begins to subside, you venture back outside and are greeted by a beautiful rainbow, stretching across the sky. The forest seems even more vibrant and alive after the storm, and you continue your walk, feeling grateful for the unexpected adventure.
