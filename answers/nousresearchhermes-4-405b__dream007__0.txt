take a step back and pause the conversation. You both take deep breaths and agree to continue the discussion when you're both in a calmer state of mind. A few hours later, when the emotions have settled, you meet again and express your viewpoints openly and honestly, truly listening to each other's perspectives. Eventually, you both come to a compromise that respects both of your values and strengthens your bond as friends. You realize that disagreements, when handled maturely, can lead to growth and a deeper understanding of one another.
