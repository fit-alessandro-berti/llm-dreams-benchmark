The air tastes like ash and rust, thick enough to choke on. My boots sink into the cracked earth of what was once a highwayâ€”now a brittle scar under a sky the color of a healing bruise. Dust stings my eyes, and every breath feels like swallowing glass. Outside the crumbling shell of an abandoned bookstore Iâ€™ve called home for three nights, the world is quiet. Too quiet. Thatâ€™s when you know the predators are hunting.  

Iâ€™m shivering in a coat pinned with scavenged gears, fingers numb. My stomach growls like a starving beast. Just this morning, I traded the last dented can of peaches for a chipped canteen and a single bullet. *Worthless*, I think, gripping the gun. *Useless unless Iâ€™m ready to die*.  

Then my hand brushes something hard in the pocket of the coatâ€”a coat I took from someoneâ€™s skeleton a week ago. Not ammo. Not food. Itâ€™s a small, hard object, smooth and cold. I pull it out. Itâ€™s a seed. A *real* seed. Not dried and brittle like the ones we find in collapsed gardens, but plump and heavy, the size of a thumbnail, with veins of silver threaded through its dark shell. It hums faintly against my palm, like a sleeping star.  

No oneâ€™s seen seeds this fresh since the Fall. Theyâ€™re ghosts. Legends.  

For a second, I hesitate. *Eat it. Itâ€™s the only energy left.* But the thought feels wrong. Like eating a promise. Instead, I kneel on the cracked asphalt. My hands are shaking, but I dig a hole with my knife, where the earth is softerâ€”where the skeleton of an oak tree once stood. I drop the seed in. The ground feelsâ€¦ eager. Like itâ€™s been waiting.  

As I cover it, something strange happens. The dust around my knees stops swirling. The wind hushes. Even the distant growl of the chrome-hided wolves that have been stalking me for days falls silent.  

Thenâ€”*a glimmer*. Not light, but *life*. A tiny green shoot punches through the soil, glowing with its own inner radiance. It unfurls impossibly fast, sprouting leaves that shimmer like stained glass. It doesnâ€™t look like any plant Iâ€™ve ever seen. Itâ€™sâ€¦ *listening*. To the silence. To the ash. To me.  

I donâ€™t feel hungry anymore. My bones donâ€™t ache. The air smells like rain.  

A shadow moves at the edge of my visionâ€”the wolves have peeled out of the ruins. But they donâ€™t come closer. They watch. One lowers its head, ears flattening as it stares at the glowing sapling. For the first time in years, the danger feelsâ€¦ curious. Not hungry.  

I stand up. My hands are still dirty from the soil. My eyes are dry. The seedling rises taller, its light softly spreading to the dead trees around it. The cracks in the asphalt begin to heal. Marshmallow-soft moss creeps from the gaps.  

I donâ€™t know what this plant is. I donâ€™t know where it came from. But I know this: *I am not hiding. I am waiting*.  

And for the first time since the world ended, Iâ€™m not alone.  

*â€”Dream complete.*  

*(Note: This is a dreamâ€”and dreams donâ€™t need rules. In this one, the act of planting wasnâ€™t about survival. It was about choice. In the broken world, sometimes the most dangerous thing is hope. But sometimes, itâ€™s the only thing that matters.)* ðŸŒ±
