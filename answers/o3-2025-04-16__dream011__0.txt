…shifting like words written on water.

The first sheet is completely blank. Then, in shimmering ink, a single sentence appears:

1. Write the first memory that made you want this career.

The moment your pen touches the page, the exam hall tilts. Desks slide past you as though on a conveyor belt, carrying classmates who no longer have faces—only glowing clocks counting down. You remember being six, repairing a broken toy spaceship with a paper clip and tape, and the blank sheet eagerly drinks in the scene, sketching it faster than you can think.

As you finish the last word, the ink dissolves and reorganizes:

2. Demonstrate everything you have learned—without using language.

Your pen melts into vapor. A chalkboard appears in the air; constellations of formulas spiral outward, overlap, and collapse into a single snow‑white feather. You instinctively blow on it. The feather drifts, tracing invisible gradients that resolve into diagrams, proof trees, circuit layouts—every technique you have studied. Applause ripples through the hall, though no one has hands to clap.

Question three glows at the far end of the room, tall as a doorway:

3. What would you risk to keep learning forever?

The clocks on your classmates’ faces spin faster. The floor becomes a mirror reflecting a night sky, and the doorway‑question pulls at you like a tide. You step forward; your reflection steps backward and vanishes. A turnstile of pages whirs overhead, tallying your hesitations. You think of weekends sacrificed, friendships frayed, the stubborn joy that kept you reading one more chapter. “Everything that isn’t me,” you whisper, though there is no mouth to shape the words. The doorway shudders open.

Inside is a single, final prompt carved in light:

4. Grade this exam yourself.

There is no rubric. Only you, a boundless white space, and the quiet thunder of your heartbeat. You feel every earlier answer hovering around you like fireflies. Some glow bright, some flicker. You sense their imperfections and brilliance equally. A calm certainty blooms; you raise an invisible stamp and mark the exam PASS.

At once the pages burst into paper birds, wheeling upward through a skylight you never noticed. Sunlight pours in, and the faceless classmates lift their clocks, which freeze at the exact same second. The hands align to spell you did it before dissolving into silver dust.

A distant bell rings—not the sterile clang of school, but the toll of a vast cathedral somewhere outside the dream. The desks, the hall, the sky of mirrors all fold like origami and slip into your pocket.

You wake with your alarm, clutching a corner of your blanket as though it were a certificate. On your palm, traced in the crease of your lifeline, is a faint impression of a feather.
