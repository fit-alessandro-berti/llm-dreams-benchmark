You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak. But the words come out in reverse—every sentence backward, like a glitchy recording. The audience leans in, mesmerized, nodding as if it makes perfect sense. You try to correct yourself, but now your voice echoes in rhymes: "Fear not the stage, the rage we assuage!"

Panic rises as your suit morphs into a shimmering cape, and the podium sprouts wings. The crowd erupts in cheers, phones out, live-streaming the chaos. You leap into the air, soaring over the seats, dropping fortune-cookie wisdom that rains down like confetti: "Dreams deferred are birds absurd!" Below, the audience catches them, cracking them open to find tiny chocolate versions of you inside, each one winking.

Suddenly, the stage tilts like a funhouse mirror, and you're sliding toward a glowing portal at the edge. You grab the mic stand, but it stretches like taffy, pulling you through. On the other side? A beach party with dinosaurs DJing disco, where Einstein breakdances and Cleopatra serves piña coladas. You join the conga line, speech forgotten, until the sun blinks out—and you wake up, heart pounding, grinning at the absurdity.
