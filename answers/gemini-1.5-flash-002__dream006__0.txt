...begin to feel a familiar tremor in my knees, a flutter of nerves that usually precedes a good performance.  But this isn't the usual pre-speech jitters.  This is different.  The faces in the crowd aren't just expectant, they're… hungry.  Not for information, not for entertainment, but for something else entirely.  Something primal.

My prepared speech, neatly printed on crisp white cards, feels ludicrously inadequate in my hand. The words blur, replaced by a growing sense of dread. The stage, which moments ago felt solid beneath my feet, now seems to sway, a precarious raft on a sea of unseen eyes.  

Then, I notice it.  Each person in the audience is holding a single, iridescent pearl, clutched tightly in their palm. The pearls glow with an inner light, pulsing faintly in rhythm with my own increasingly rapid heartbeat.  

As I open my mouth to speak, a single, perfect pearl rolls from my lips, landing with a soft click on the polished stage.  It glows brighter than any of the others, a beacon in the dim light of the auditorium.  The hungry gazes intensify, and a low, guttural hum rises from the crowd, a sound that resonates deep within my chest, vibrating my very bones.  

I realize, with horrifying clarity, that this isn't a speech I'm giving.  This is an offering.  And the audience… they are waiting to consume me.  The tremor in my knees intensifies, morphing into a full-blown, uncontrollable shaking.  The last thing I see, before the darkness claims me completely, is a thousand outstretched hands reaching for the light emanating from the pearl I've lost… and from me.
