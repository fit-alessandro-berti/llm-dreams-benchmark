...momentarily land face-to-face with a towering man dressed in a leather jacket, his presence radiating confidence. He's laughing with a group, completely oblivious to you until you loom into his peripheral vision. You freeze, then shake your head, surprised you hadn’t noticed him before. 

A murmur ripples through the room. "Is that him?" Some unknown voice whispers. Curiosity overrides the awkwardness, and you step forward. He turns, spots you, and grins—half-astonished, half-amused.

"You're here," he says in a deep, smooth tone. "I made a reservation for you. Drinks ready. Ready to make a plan?" 

No one around you responds, but somehow, you feel a spark of excitement. This isn’t a chance encounter anymore—it’s the beginning. As you two share your first meaningful look—tense, honest, and electric—a quiet understanding passes between you. The chatter fades, but you’re not alone in your realization: something important is happening tonight, and it’s about to change everything.

Suddenly, a text buzzes on your phone: *“You match.”* You don’t check it—your eyes scan the room with borrowed courage. Behind the leather-clad man, near the back of a smaller circle, a woman with long, silver hair and eyes like storm clouds nods toward a small table. Between you, two quiet figures bump into a checkered tablecloth. They turn, a soft smile visible between them.

What happens next isn’t clear. But as the room stills around you, you realize—no one owes you an explanation. Just the weight of a moment? The moment you were chosen.  

And somewhere, deep down, you know you’ll never stop wondering why.
