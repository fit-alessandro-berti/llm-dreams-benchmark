...begin to realize the maze isn't external at all.

The walls, made of shifting equations and whispering riddles, start to feel familiar. The cold stone turns into the smooth, cool surface of a mirror, but instead of reflecting your face, it reflects your *thoughts*.

**The Deeper You Go**

With every puzzle solved, the air grows heavier, filled with the scent of ozone and old paper. You encounter three distinct chambers:

1.  **The Chamber of Paradox:** In the center floats a simple wooden box. The inscription reads: *"To open, you must believe the box is empty. To believe it is empty, you must first open it."* The lock is made of light, pulsating in rhythm with your heartbeat.
2.  **The Labyrinth of Voices:** You enter a corridor lined with thousands of mouths carved into the stone, all whispering fragmented memories—some you recognize, some you don't. They are speaking a language you understand but have never heard spoken. They are asking you to solve a riddle: *"I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but never go outside. What am I?"*
3.  **The Infinite Archive:** The floor drops away, replaced by a swirling nebula of glowing data points. To cross, you must step only on the points that rhyme, but the points change every time you blink.

You stand at the threshold of these three challenges. The maze is waiting for your move.
