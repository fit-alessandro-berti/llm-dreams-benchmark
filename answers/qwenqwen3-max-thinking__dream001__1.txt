...panic, your pulse thrumming in your temples like a trapped bird. The city stretches in every direction—impossibly tall buildings of iridescent glass, streets that coil like sleeping serpents, and a sky tinged violet, as if twilight forgot to end. You check your pockets: nothing but a smooth river stone and a crumpled note that reads, *"Trust the paper birds."*

Just then, a gust of wind lifts the note from your fingers. It spirals upward and dissolves into a flock of origami cranes, their wings whispering as they flutter toward a distant spire shaped like a key. One detaches and lands on your shoulder, folding itself into a compass that points not north, but toward a narrow alley where the streetlights hum a familiar tune—the lullaby your grandmother used to sing.

You follow, feet barely touching the cobblestones that shift color with each step: blue for doubt, gold for hope. Doorways breathe in and out like lungs. At the alley’s end stands a clockmaker’s shop, its window filled with timepieces ticking backward. The paper crane flutters inside, and you step through the door…

...only to find yourself seated at a long oak table in a sunlit room. The others are already there—faces you’ve never seen but somehow know: the librarian who once saved you from a storm, the stranger who gave you directions in a foreign city years ago, even your childhood dog, now human-eyed and wearing a waistcoat. They smile as if you’re exactly on time.

At the head of the table sits your future self, holding a steaming cup of tea that smells like rain and old books. “You made it,” they say, sliding a folder across the table. “Now, shall we discuss what happens next?”

Outside, the paper birds land softly on the windowsill, folding themselves into blank pages—waiting.
