—hurts to breathe, doesn’t it? The salt wind lashes every face on deck, and even the timbers seem to scream in protest. The main mast groans like a dying whale, canvas snapping in hysterics above us.

I grip the rail until my knuckles blanch. The wheel bucks beneath my hands as though the ship itself wants to hurl itself sideways into the black water. Lightning forks overhead; for one split second the entire ocean is lit in bruised violet, and I can see the wave that’s coming—taller than the crow’s nest, a moving cliff of water.

“Helmsman, two points to port!” I shout—though my voice is shredded by the gale and I’m not certain anyone can hear. Eyes wide, young Tarlow yanks the wheel. For a heartbeat the bow swings, starboard rail awash, water pouring through scuppers like waterfalls. We rise—higher, higher—until we teeter on that glass-green precipice. The crew is praying or vomiting or both.

I taste iron; a rivulet of blood from my split lip mingles with the spray. My coat’s grown heavy as armor, soaked through. Behind me someone screams: “Cap, the mizzen’s gone!” The crack of timber snapping is almost musical, futile against the storm’s percussion.

If I’m dreaming, then this dream has rules I don’t yet understand. There’s a compass in my pocket I never remember stowing, its glass cracked, needle spinning like a dervish. Every revolution, it points for a heartbeat at a single word etched on the inner ring: HOPE. Then it whirls again, frantic.

I fight my way to the rail, boots slipping on icy planks. “Listen!” I roar—a sound that feels lifted from some ancestral throat. “The storm’s not trying to drown us. It’s waking us up!” The crew turn chalk-white faces toward me, half-mad, half-rapt.

Another thunderclap. A blink of silver-veined darkness. And suddenly, perfectly, the rain stops. A pocket of impossible silence opens above the deck. The great wave stalls, frozen mid-crash, crystallised droplets suspended like starlight. For the length of one inhale the sea is glass.

In that hush the needle of the impossible compass locks dead ahead—no longer spinning—pointing across a mirror-smooth world.

I feel my lips curl, teeth blood-bright. “Ease the sheets,” I murmur—then louder: “Set every stitch of canvas! Take the current beneath us—no rudder, no fear.” My own voice carries a certainty I have never felt awake.

The crew hesitates, then obeys without question. Ropes sing, sails unfurl like wings. The sound is not wind but breath—the ship drawing a single monumental breath.

And beneath our keel the stars appear, swarming not from the sky but from the sea itself, rising in spirals of phosphorescence. Constellations inverted: Orion swimming alongside dolphins of light, the Pleiades clustered like jellyfish. We are no longer sailing on water; we are afloat in the night sky’s reflection, the boundary between air and ocean forgetting itself.

I look down. My hands gleam—scars luminous, map-lines of every voyage painted in starlight. I lay them on the wheel not to steer but to listen. The ship is dreaming us, not the other way around.

Behind me footsteps: the youngest cabin boy, Tansy. Eyes like newly minted coins. “Captain,” she whispers, “where are we bound?”

“Home,” I answer, though I no longer know whose home it is. “Somewhere the storm can’t follow.”

She smiles—no fear, only wonder—and points ahead. There, the horizon folds upon itself like parchment. A door outlined in cobalt flame hangs upon nothing, yawning open to whatever waits on the other side. Maybe waking. Maybe a second dream running inside the first like a tide within a tide.

The deck tilts again, gently now. God, or the dream, or the ship herself urges us forward. Spray turns to sparks; rigging hums a lullaby in a language only hips and shoulders understand.

I close my eyes. I can feel the beginning of morning pressing with soft fingers at the edges of everything. But not yet. Not quite. We glide through that burning door, star-sails filling.

Beyond it, I sense another storm waiting—gentler, slower, the kind that brings rain you can drink. And perhaps, at last, a harbor whose name we almost remember.
