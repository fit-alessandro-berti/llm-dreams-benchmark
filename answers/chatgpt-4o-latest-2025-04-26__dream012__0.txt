stand tall at the helm, the salty wind whipping your hair and the rain stinging your face. You feel the ship groaning beneath you like a living creature, struggling against the monstrous waves. Your crewâ€™s wide, fearful eyes are locked on you, waiting.

You raise your voice over the howling wind.  
*"Hold steady! Trust the ship and trust yourselves!"*  
The men and women nod, gripping ropes and rails with white-knuckled determination.

Ahead, you glimpse something through the mist â€” a faint, golden light bobbing just above the waves. It pulses like a heartbeat, calling to you. Somewhere deep inside, you know itâ€™s not just a trick of the storm â€” itâ€™s a guide.

You bark orders:  
*"Starboard ten degrees! Follow the light!"*  

The ship lurches, the mast groans under the strain, but the crew obeys without hesitation. As you cut through the water, chasing the shimmering beacon, you feel the storm start to shift â€” not fading, but changing. The clouds above swirl into impossible shapes: massive, ghostly figures reaching down with arms of lightning.

Yet you are not afraid. You grip the wheel tighter, heart pounding with fierce resolve. You realize the storm isn't trying to destroy you â€” it's *testing* you.

You shout one last command into the roaring dark:  
*"We are the storm now! Drive forward!"*

And the ship surges ahead, the sea itself seeming to bow before your will.
