As you feel the storm approaching, the once serene forest begins to transform. The gentle rustling of leaves turns into a howling wind, and the temperature drops sharply. You can see the trees bending and swaying, their branches creaking ominously. The sky darkens rapidly, as if night has fallen in an instant.

You quicken your pace, seeking shelter. The path ahead is obscured by a thick fog that seems to have appeared out of nowhere. You can barely see a few feet in front of you, but you press on, guided by an instinctual need to find safety.

Suddenly, you hear a loud crack. A massive tree trunk falls to the ground just a few yards away, blocking your path. You jump back just in time, your heart pounding in your chest. The storm is intensifying, and you know you need to find cover soon.

You spot a small, ancient-looking cabin nestled between the trees. It looks weathered but sturdy, and it's the only shelter in sight. You run towards it, the wind and rain lashing against your face. As you reach the cabin, you notice the door is slightly ajar.

With a deep breath, you push the door open and step inside. The cabin is dimly lit by a single lantern hanging from the ceiling. It's sparsely furnished, with a small table, a few chairs, and a fireplace. The fire is already lit, casting a warm glow throughout the room.

You close the door behind you, shutting out the howling storm. As you turn around, you notice an old, leather-bound book lying on the table. It's open to a page filled with strange symbols and illustrations. You pick it up, your curiosity piqued.

As you study the book, you hear a soft whisper. It seems to be coming from the shadows in the corner of the room. You squint, trying to make out any form, but it's too dark. The whisper grows louder, more insistent. You feel a chill run down your spine, but you can't help but feel drawn to the mysterious voice.

You take a step towards the shadows, the book still in your hand. The whisper turns into a soft, melodic hum. It's almost soothing, yet there's an underlying sense of urgency. You reach out your hand, and as your fingers touch the darkness, everything goes white.

When your vision clears, you find yourself standing in a vast, open field. The storm is gone, replaced by a clear, starry night. The old cabin is nowhere to be seen. You look down at your hand, still clutching the leather-bound book. The symbols on the pages seem to glow softly in the moonlight.

You open your mouth to speak, but no words come out. Instead, you hear a voice in your head. "You have been chosen," it says. "Your journey has only just begun."

You look around, bewildered, as the stars above seem to align in a pattern you've never seen before. The dream fades, leaving you with a sense of wonder and anticipation for what lies ahead.
