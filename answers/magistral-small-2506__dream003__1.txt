The intricate patterns on the box begin to shimmer faintly under your touch, as if reacting to your presence. The lines and symbols seem to shift and rearrange themselves, forming shapes that resemble constellations in the night sky. A soft hum fills the air, low and resonant, like a distant heartbeat.

Then, without warning, the box splits open along unseen seams, revealing not the expected contents within, but instead a swirling vortex of iridescent mist. The mist cools your skin as it drifts outward, and within its depths, you catch glimpses of fleeting images—faces, landscapes, fragments of forgotten stories. One face lingers longer than the others: a woman with silver-threaded hair and eyes that glow like distant stars.

She smiles at you, though her mouth never moves. *"The key,"* she murmurs, her voice echoing in your mind, *"is not lost. It is waiting where the dream meets the waking world."*

The mist thickens, and the box vanishes from your hands. When you open your eyes, you are no longer in the room. Instead, you stand at the edge of a vast, moonlit forest, where the trees whisper in a language just beyond understanding. The woman is there, standing between two ancient trees, her fingers tracing symbols into the air. She turns to you again, and the words she speaks are not in any tongue you know, yet you understand them perfectly:

*"To unlock the box, you must first unlock yourself."*

A wind rises, carrying with it the scent of rain and something far older—something that smells like the first breath of the world. The trees bend toward you, their branches weaving into a path that leads deeper into the forest, where the shadows stretch longer than night itself.

You step forward.

(Would you like to continue the dream? Or would you prefer to wake up?)
