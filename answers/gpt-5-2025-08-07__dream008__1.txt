you reach for your keyboard, but the keys are warm and soft, like bread rolls left too long under a heat lamp. The letters smear onto your fingers in inky curls. Your boss is perched on the edge of your desk, arms folded, the face of his wristwatch utterly blank, reflecting the buzzing fluorescent light.

“Go on,” he says, and when he speaks, staples fall out of his mouth. They land in a neat line, linking your paperwork to the desk like a leash.

The project folder is enormous, heavier than it looks. When you open it, pages inhale, the paragraphs rising and falling as if sleeping animals. The brief is a single sentence that keeps rewriting itself: Build an app that predicts yesterday. No, model the color of silence. No, deliver everything by lunch, which was last week.

The clock on the wall is spinning, not forward or backward, but as if stirred. The hum of the office deepens—the printer clears its throat and begins narrating the weather, the coffee maker whispers secrets in a language made of steam.

You try to start by asking for requirements. Your boss nods, his tie pattern a small aquarium of koi fish that swim when you blink. “We don’t have time for that,” he says, though there is no time at all, just the idea of it holding very still.

You click your mouse, which is your heart. The cursor skitters, a moth trying to find the moon. The project plan opens, a long hallway of bullet points that stretch to the vanishing point. At the far end, you can just make out a red door labeled DONE.

“How am I supposed to—” you say, but your voice comes out in paperclips, bent and unusable.

You stand. The carpet is static and crackles your calves like language. The clock ticks louder, becomes a woodpecker drumming inside the wall. You reach up, pinch the minute hand between two fingers, and it stretches like taffy. You pull and pull until it unzips the whole room. Behind the office is night, crisp and cool, with constellations arranged in tidy grids, each star a sticky note labeled “five minutes,” “ten minutes,” “almost there.”

You gather an armful of minutes. They are faintly warm, smells of citrus and pencil shavings. Back at your desk, you staple them to your screen, and the progress bar, which had been an unmoving shoreline, lifts and finally decides to be a tide.

Your boss watches, then becomes very still. He is a coat rack stacked with suits, each suit carrying a different expression. You pick one. It smiles, encouragingly.

Now your keyboard has hardened. The keys are back, crisp and cool, though some of them have swapped places: the M is where the A should be, the Q has moved offshore. You begin typing anyway. The words arrive in a disorderly flock. Some refuse to land, circling the ceiling lights like starlings. You whistle softly, and a couple of sentences drop down and nest in your paragraphs.

“Good,” says the boss-rack. Somewhere, a conference room applauds, or maybe it’s a box of pushpins shaken gently.

A deadline strides through the door on four legs. It looks like a lean greyhound with a collar labeled 2:00 PM. It sniffs your ankles, impatient but polite. You tear off a corner of a Gantt chart and feed it. It chews thoughtfully, then curls under your desk and waits.

You open a file named Start. Inside is a photograph of a button under glass. Your desk has sprouted that same glass dome at its corner. The label says START in the kind of font that means business. You lift the dome. The button is warm, pulsing, like a frog. Your boss leans forward, the suits all holding their breath.

“Once you press it,” he says, vape of staples, “everything will begin.”

You hover. You remember how beginning always summons the end, how moving forward calls the wolf of completion from the trees. You think about delaying, finding a better pen, a stronger coffee, a different you. Then you see the plant in the corner, the one you always forget to water. It raises a leaf and types three steady words on your screen with the tip: It starts now.

You press.

The ceiling sheds confetti in the form of calendar pages, which flutter around you and land in neat stacks by month. The printer laughs and spits out a flock of diagrams that assemble themselves along the walls. Your mouse-heart keeps a metronome, patient and clear. On your screen, the sentences click into alignment as if magnetized. The impossible part of the project opens like a secret passage; behind it, there’s a small, bright room where everything is simpler. Time is folded laundry. You put it on. It fits. All the pockets are full of minutes you didn’t know you had.

You move through the tasks the way you sweep a floor, not thinking about the last inch, just moving the broom. The greyhound under your desk rolls onto its back so you can tick the box that says Phase 1. You do. It kicks the air, delighted, and grows a little bell around its collar that rings exactly at the pace you need.

When you’re done, the report blossoms into a paper crane. You pick it up, feel the smallest purr in its chest. You blow once on its folded neck, and it lifts, circles your head twice, and lands on your boss’s shoulder. He reaches up without looking, strokes its back. The crane smooths into a checkmark as if it always knew it would.

“Right on time,” he says, and taps his blank watch, which now has hands. They spin backward for a moment and then stop, pointing to a number that doesn’t exist but feels right.

You look around. The office is an aquarium again, the koi tie swimming lazily along the glass of your screen. The fluorescent buzz has softened into the sound of distant rain. The project folder is thin and light. Your boss’s faces hang quietly on their hangers.

“Anything else?” you ask, trying your voice. It comes out a ribbon this time, silk and steady.

He shakes his head. “No. We were always just waiting for you to begin.”

The alarm starts, a dentist’s drill of a beep with a coffee smell, but it’s only the copier clearing a jam, and then it’s your phone, and then it’s birds outside the window you didn’t know your office had. You reach to silence it and your hand finds the smooth curve of the START button, which is now the snooze, which is now the sun on your sheets.

You promise the plant you’ll water it today. It nods with an entire forest’s authority as the room thins, the paperwork yawns, the greyhound of the deadline sets its head on your knee and turns into the edge of your blanket, warm and familiar.

You blink, and the crane is only a crease in the pillowcase, and the office smell is only morning, and impossible is just a word that forgets itself every time you breathe.
