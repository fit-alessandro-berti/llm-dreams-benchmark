You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and turn to find the sky darkening with ominous clouds that swirl erratically. The wind picks up, causing the trees to bend and sway fiercely, their leaves whipping around like wild dancers. As the thunder roars overhead, lightning flashes across the sky, illuminating the dense woods in fleeting bursts of white and gray. You hear the distant crack of branches breaking under the force of the tempest, and a sudden rush of rain begins to pour, drumming loudly on the leaves and ground. Amidst the chaos, you sense a strange, glowing light emanating from deeper within the forest, beckoning you to explore further despite the storm's fury.
