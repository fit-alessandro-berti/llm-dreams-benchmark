take a break from the discussion. You both step away from each other, deciding that it's best for your friendship to cool off before continuing the conversation later. 

In the quiet solitude, you reflect on what caused this heated argument in the first place. You realize that perhaps there was an underlying issue of miscommunication or unmet expectations that has been brewing between you two. You decide that addressing these issues head-on, with empathy and patience, is essential for repairing your friendship.

As you walk away from the argument, you recall the cherished memories shared with this friend - long conversations late at night, laughing together over silly jokes, celebrating successes side by side. These moments reaffirm how valuable this person was in your life.

You take a deep breath of fresh air and let it fill your lungs fully before exhaling slowly while allowing all negative energy to dissipate from within you. You feel lighter - refreshed and ready for another conversation once emotions have calmed down.

Taking time alone allows both parties involved enough space, perspective, patience without external pressures which ultimately helps mend things better than staying entrenched in conflict mode itself could ever achieve.

When you return back together later or next day if needed; remember how empathic each side was about the other's point of view during this break period makes more understanding and compassionate communication possible. You are then able to resume your discussion on an amicable and open-minded note, rekindling a stronger bond than ever before between friends who shared so much together despite temporary disagreements along their journey.
