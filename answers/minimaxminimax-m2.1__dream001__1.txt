You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to search the streets, but the buildings seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them—Victorian facades melting into glass towers, narrow alleyways opening suddenly into sunlit plazas that couldn't have existed seconds before.

The sidewalks are crowded with people who won't meet your eyes. You try to ask for directions, but your voice comes out as a whisper, swallowed by the ambient hum of traffic that sounds more like distant music than engines. A streetcar rumbles past, but it has no rails, gliding silently on some invisible track that curves upward and disappears into the clouds.

You check your pockets for a phone, a map, anything—but find only a single brass key that hums with warmth against your palm. You don't remember receiving it, yet you know somehow that it's the key to wherever you're supposed to be. The buildings around you begin to narrow, pressing closer, and you realize with a start that you've been walking in a spiral without meaning to, the streets coiling tighter around a central point you can't yet see.

A woman in a green coat pauses beside you. Her face shifts when you try to focus on it—young, old, familiar, strange. "You're looking for the meeting," she says, not a question. She points toward a doorway that definitely wasn't there before, framed in rust-colored brick, slightly ajar, leaking amber light onto the cobblestones. "You have seventeen minutes." She smiles, and her teeth are made of keys.

You walk toward the door, and the city exhales around you, settling into stillness. Beyond the threshold, stairs spiral downward and upward simultaneously, and you can hear, very faintly, the sound of people arguing about something important—something that might change everything, if only you can find your way in.
