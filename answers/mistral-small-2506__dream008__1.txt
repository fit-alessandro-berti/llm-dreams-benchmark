feel a wave of panic rise in your chest. The room seems to tilt slightly, the fluorescent lights flickering as if struggling to stay on. Your boss’s face blurs into a featureless mask, their voice stretching into an echo: *"You can do this. Just start."*

You glance at your desk—papers swirl into the air like autumn leaves, rearranging themselves into impossible equations. The computer screen flickers, displaying a countdown timer that wasn’t there before. The numbers are moving too fast.

Your hands hover over the keyboard, but when you press a key, the letters rearrange into symbols you don’t recognize. The walls of the office begin to pulse, breathing in and out like a living thing. Your coworkers’ faces twist into something unnatural—eyes too wide, smiles too sharp.

Then, the impossible happens. The project file on your screen *writes itself*. Words spill across the page in a language that makes no sense, yet somehow, you understand it. The deadline timer freezes. Your boss’s voice cuts through the chaos: *"See? You just needed to begin."*

You wake up—sweating, heart pounding—but the last thing you see before your eyes fully open is the corner of your desk, where a single sheet of paper lies, covered in the same strange symbols from your dream.

And it’s dated *tomorrow*.
