You are participating in a competition where the grand prize is your dream job. As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and obstacles that blur the line between reality and surrealism.

The first challenge is a labyrinth made of floating books—each spine inscribed with a memory you’ve forgotten. You must read them aloud to unlock the next passage, but every word you speak becomes a bird that flutters away, carrying fragments of your voice into the sky. You realize: to succeed, you must speak not just truth, but vulnerability. You weep as you recount your first failure, your first quiet doubt—and the birds return, weaving themselves into a bridge of feathers and ink.

The second challenge: a silent orchestra. Dozens of musicians play instruments made of glass, their melodies invisible. The conductor, a figure with no face, points at you. You must conduct without hands. You close your eyes and breathe in rhythm—and your heartbeat becomes the tempo. The glass instruments shiver, then resonate with harmony. The crowd—faceless, too—starts to weep.

Then comes the final test: a mirror room. Each mirror shows a version of you who chose a different path—some wealthy, some lonely, some forgotten. In the center, a single door. A voice whispers: *“You cannot have the dream job if you still believe you need to be perfect.”*

You step forward—and instead of opening the door, you knock on the mirrors. One by one, the reflections crack. You smile as your fractured selves reach out, hug you, whisper *“We’re proud of you.”* 

The door swings open—no throne, no trophy, no title. Just a small wooden desk, a single notebook, and a pen that glows like dawn.

A woman in a simple dress steps forward. It’s you. Older. Warm. Eyes bright with quiet triumph.

“You didn’t win the job,” she says. “You became it.”

You wake with a gasp—sunlight spilling across your bedroom floor. On your nightstand, your phone buzzes: a notification from your current workplace.

*“We’ve reviewed your proposal. You’ve been assigned to lead the new creative initiative. Starting tomorrow.”*

You sit up. 

And for the first time in years—you don’t question if you’re ready.

You just smile.

And begin to write.
