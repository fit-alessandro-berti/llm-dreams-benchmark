...a faint, pulsing glow emanating from within.  My fingers trace the intricate carvings on the lid, each one a swirling, almost living pattern.  They seem to shift and change as I touch them, like a kaleidoscope of forgotten languages.  A low hum vibrates through the box, growing louder with each passing second.  The glow intensifies, bathing the room in a soft, ethereal light.  

Suddenly, a voice, soft as a whisper, echoes from within the box.  "Open me, seeker.  I hold the answers you seek."

My heart pounds in my chest.  This box, this voice, it feels...familiar.  Like a forgotten memory, a long-lost dream.  I hesitate, fear battling with a strange, irresistible urge to unlock it.  What secrets lie within?  What answers will I find? 

The hum intensifies, the glow pulses brighter, and the voice whispers again, "The key is not in the lock, but within." 


What do you do next?
