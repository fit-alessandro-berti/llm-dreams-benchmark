…stop talking.

Not out of surrender, and not out of anger—more like you’ve both reached a cliff-edge where the next word might be the push that sends everything over. The room hums with leftover sentences. You can feel them, all the things you could say, gathering like bees behind your teeth.

Your friend looks as wrecked as you feel.

The air between you shifts. The argument has been looping, same points said louder, like an echo chamber with teeth. You both know you’re not really talking about the thing you’re talking about.

You inhale.

“Wait,” you say. “Can we rewind?”

You raise your hand like you’re holding a remote, thumb pressing an invisible button. The world shudders, glitches—the light in the room flickers backwards through its own brightness, your friend’s last insult un-spools into nonsense, your own retort melts into a quick sharp breath and vanishes. The clock on the wall ticks in reverse. Your heartbeats reorder themselves.

You realize: oh, right. This is a dream.

That recognition doesn’t wake you. It makes you careful.

You tap the air again, slowly, until you’re back at the moment just before it all went wrong—before the misunderstanding, before the tone-change, before the phrase that turned your friend’s eyes hard.

Now the room is quiet, but this quiet is new; unspent. Your friend is mid-sentence, still soft, still reachable. You can feel the branching paths of what you might say, fanning out in front of you like transparent roads: the petty one, the defensive one, the one where you try to win so hard you lose them.

You choose differently.

“Hold on,” you say gently, interrupting your own old future. “I’m getting scared we’re going to hurt each other more than we need to.”

They blink. This is not the script they remember following.

“I’m not trying to beat you,” you continue. “I just… this matters to me because you matter to me. I don’t want to turn you into an enemy over this.”

Your heart thuds. The dream gives you too much access: you can feel what they feel. The stab of being misunderstood. The fear you’ll leave. The pride they’ve been using like armor because vulnerability always got them burned before.

You weren’t seeing that a moment ago. Now you do.

Your friend exhales, shoulders dipping a fraction. “I feel like you’re not hearing what this is costing me,” they say, but now it comes out raw instead of sharp.

You almost follow the old path, almost argue the details, but you catch the ghost of how badly that ended. You adjust.

“Okay. Then help me understand. Say it like I believe you.”

They frown, half-suspicious. “Like you believe me?”

“Yeah,” you say. “Pretend I already trust that you’re not trying to undermine me. That I know you’re on my side. Say it from there.”

The dream leans in.

Your friend hesitates, and then something unclenches. Their voice changes. They talk—not in facts and accusations, but in story. In fear. In hope. In the ugly childhood thing that wired them to panic when plans change. In the pressure they’ve been carrying, silent and convinced you’d call it “dramatic” if they spoke up. Their words come haltingly at first, then with a kind of trembling relief.

With every sentence, the room brightens a little. The clock starts moving forward again.

You listen, really listen, and your own defensive arguments fall away like scaffolding you suddenly realize was never holding anything up. You see where you’d cut them off, where you’d made assumptions, where your need to be “right” had spoken over your need to be kind.

When you speak this time, your voice is softer.

“Okay,” you say. “I didn’t know it hit you like that. I’m sorry I kept pushing instead of checking in. Here’s where I’m coming from…”

You explain your side, but differently now. You don’t try to win; you try to be visible. You talk about your values, your fears of losing yourself, your fear of losing them. That last one hangs heavy between you.

They stare at you like you’ve just answered a question they hadn’t dared ask out loud.

“Do you… actually think I’m important?” they ask, and it sounds absurdly small and deadly serious.

You laugh, startled. “Of course I do. This whole meltdown is because I do.”

The dream does a strange, tender thing: it zooms out, and you see both of you from above—two figures in a room, haloed by all the possible timelines branching off you. You see the version where you didn’t stop, where you said the clever, cruel thing and they slammed the door. You see the version where they did. You feel the lingering ache from arguments that did go that way, in other times, with other people, where you woke up regretting words you couldn’t unsay.

Then you zoom back in, into your body, into this choice.

Your friend’s eyes are wet now. “I don’t want to lose you over this,” they say.

“You’re not going to,” you reply. “But we might have to accept we see this differently. And that’s okay. I just need to know we’re still on the same team.”

You reach out your hand, uncertain.

For a second they don’t move.

Then they take it.

The contact is strangely electric; it stabilizes the dream. Colors sharpen. The knot in your gut loosens. There’s no neat resolution of the issue, no miraculous total agreement. But there’s a new rule written quietly between you: we value us more than we value being right.

The lights dim. The scene blurs at the edges, and you feel that hovering sense of waking.

As the dream starts to lift, your friend looks at you one more time and says, very clearly, “Please remember you can do that when you’re awake.”

You wake with your heart hammering, a bit of the argument’s ghost still in your chest—and a vivid memory of the moment you chose to stop, rewind, and answer with care instead of victory.
