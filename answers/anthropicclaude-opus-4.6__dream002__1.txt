# The Storm Dream

You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and—

The air thickens. Not with humidity, but with *intention*, as if the sky itself has turned to look at you.

The first thing you notice is the silence. The birds stop mid-song—not trailing off, but cutting out like someone pulled a plug. The insects go quiet. Even your footsteps on the forest floor seem muffled, swallowed by something vast and listening.

Then the light changes. The green canopy above shifts to a bruised amber, and the shadows between the trees stretch in directions that don't match the sun. You look up and the clouds are moving *impossibly* fast—not rolling in from one direction but spiraling inward, converging on a point directly above you.

Your skin prickles. Every hair stands on end.

The wind arrives—not gradually but all at once, warm and electric, carrying the smell of ozone and something older, something like wet stone and iron. The trees begin to sway, but they're swaying *toward* you, bending inward like curious giants.

A bolt of lightning strikes a massive oak thirty feet ahead, and instead of fire, the tree splits open to reveal a staircase spiraling downward into blue-white light. The thunder that follows doesn't fade—it holds, becoming a low resonant hum, almost a voice, almost a word you can *nearly* understand.

Rain begins to fall, but each drop that touches your skin feels like a tiny electric kiss, and where it hits the ground, small luminous flowers bloom instantly, glowing violet and gold.

You realize the storm isn't destroying anything. It's *opening* something.

The staircase in the oak pulses with light, and you feel a pull—not physical, but emotional—the same feeling as remembering something wonderful you'd completely forgotten.

You step forward.

The hum sharpens into something almost like your name.

You descend.

And the forest closes gently above you like a held breath finally released, and below, below, below there is a world lit by captured lightning, where rivers run along the ceiling and someone who looks exactly like you—but older, calmer, smiling—is sitting at a table set for two.

"You always come when it storms," they say.

They pour you tea. It tastes like the color blue.

And for the first time in as long as you can remember, you are not afraid of anything at all.

*The dream holds you here, suspended in warmth, for what feels like years and seconds simultaneously, until morning pulls you gently back.*
