to gather herbs near the edge of a desolate field, hoping to find anything edible to sustain you. As I kneel, my fingers brush against something smooth and cool beneath the dust—amply glowing runes etched into the surface of a cracked volcanic rock.  

Curious, I turn it horizontally, casting a faint, blue light into the dim fading light of the setting sun. The runes pulse again, brighter this time, shifting into a warning pattern: *"When needed, bear the burden. Sacrifice to keep the flame alive."* Suddenly, from the shadows wrapping around the rock, a figure steps forward—tall, cloaked, with eyes like burning coals.  

"You seek life," the figure says, its voice like storm wind over ash. "Most would steal it, hoard it, or destroy it. You… share."  

Before I can reply, tendrils of dark mist coil from the rock, weaving around my ankles, pulling me to my knees. The crystal pulses once more, and a choice is laid before me: carry the monolith to the central ruins and awaken the dormant energy it holds, or let it remain hidden, risking future darkness to preserve what little light remains.  

I look down at the once-lush valley around us, cracked and silent, and hesitate.  

But beneath the frost of fear, a spark burns.  

*"One hand leads the way,"* whispers the wind.  

I rise. The monolith gleams between me and the ruins.  

Whatever I do…  
the world changes.
