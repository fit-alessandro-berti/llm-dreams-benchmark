Okay, here we go, I'm dreaming... deep breath... stage lights are warm, almost too warm, and the faces, wow, so many faces. They’re all a blur, a sea of expectant eyes, some smiling, some serious, some just...there.  Okay, okay, this is it.  I clear my throat, feeling the microphone suddenly HUGE against my lips. I begin to…

…**speak, but not with words. No, instead of a speech, I find myself pulling something from my pocket. It’s a small, intricately carved wooden bird, no bigger than my thumb.**

I hold it up, and the bird, somehow, begins to move. Its tiny wings flutter, not frantically, but with a deliberate grace.  It takes flight from my hand, hovering just above the microphone, emitting a soft, melodic chirping. The chirping morphs, the notes becoming complex and layered, swirling around the room like a soft, invisible breeze.  

The audience, instead of being confused or restless, seems completely mesmerized. They lean forward, their faces open and receptive.  **The music the bird is creating isn't just sound; it's a feeling. I feel it too – a gentle wave of peace and understanding wash over me.**

As the bird circles the room, the music seems to weave itself into the air, creating images.  I see landscapes blooming in vibrant colour, people laughing with unbridled joy, and moments of quiet contemplation.  The images are fleeting, like shimmering reflections in water, but their impact is profound.

The bird’s music slows, becoming a soft hum, and then, it returns to my hand, landing lightly on my palm.  It’s silent once more, just a small piece of wood. I look up at the audience, and though no words were spoken, I feel a profound connection. They’re nodding, some are smiling, some have tears in their eyes, but all seem… understood.

**I don’t give a speech. I just smile. The dream begins to fade then, like a slow sunrise dissolving into the day. The feeling of calm remains with me, though.**
