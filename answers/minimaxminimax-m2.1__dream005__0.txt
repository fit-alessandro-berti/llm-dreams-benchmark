# The Gathering

You weave through the periphery of the party, the music thumping beneath your feet like a second heartbeat. The space seems to shift and expand around you—vaulted ceilings that weren't there moments ago, corridors that lead back to where you started. You've lost track of where you've seen your friend, that one familiar face in this sea of strangers, and the searching has begun to feel less like navigation and more like a form of wandering prayer.

You pass a cluster of people clustered near a window, their laughter sharp and brittle like glass being dropped. They seem to be performing joy, each trying to outdo the others, and you wonder if any of them feel as hollow as they sound. A woman with silver earrings catches your eye and smiles, but there's something knowing in it, something that suggests she understands exactly how lost you feel. You nod politely and move on.

The crowd thickens near what appears to be a long dining table, set with candles that burn in colors you can't quite name—blues and purples that shouldn't exist in flame. Here, the conversations seem to happen in overlapping layers, half-heard fragments about mortgages and childhood pets and something about a book that changed everything. You catch a young man staring at his phone, the blue light washing over his face, and you recognize in his expression the particular loneliness of being surrounded by people while wishing you were somewhere else entirely.

You turn a corner and find yourself in a quieter section, where an older couple sways gently to music that only they can hear. Their eyes are closed, and their hands speak a language of decades—small adjustments, familiar pressure, the kind of knowing that only comes from having navigated many nights just like this one together. You feel like an intruder in a private world, but also, strangely, like you've stumbled onto proof that connection is possible in this maze of strangers.

The rooms keep multiplying. You find yourself in a garden that shouldn't fit inside this building, grass cool beneath your bare feet, stars overhead that you suspect aren't real. A group sits in a circle on the lawn, passing a bottle of something that glows faintly, and they invite you to join them. Their faces are kind but undefined, as if they're people you've known but can't quite place—former coworkers, neighbors from a life you only half-remember. You sit for a moment, and the conversation drifts between philosophy and nonsense, between profound confessions and the kind of small talk that means nothing and everything at once.

But the thought of your friend keeps pulling you forward, a string tied around your chest. You excuse yourself and continue moving, through doors that open onto unexpected rooms, past bathrooms with mirrors that show you from angles you don't recognize. You catch glimpses of yourself in reflective surfaces—sometimes older, sometimes younger, sometimes wearing clothes you don't own.

Eventually, you find them.

They're standing near a door that leads out onto a balcony overlooking a city that doesn't exist in any atlas. The light here is golden, the kind of late afternoon light that makes everything look significant. Your friend turns as if they've been expecting you, and their face breaks into a smile that feels like home in a strange and shifting place.

"There you are," they say, as if you've simply been gone for a moment, as if the entire labyrinthine journey was only the blink of an eye.

You want to tell them about the rooms, the people, the strange and lonely beautiful things you've seen. But the words feel unnecessary here, in this quiet corner of the dream. They hand you a drink that tastes like memories, and you stand together on the balcony, watching the city below that has no name, no history, no rules.

For now, at least, you've found what you were looking for. And the party continues all around you, full of strangers who might become friends, full of rooms you haven't yet discovered, full of the endless and peculiar possibility that dreams are made of.
