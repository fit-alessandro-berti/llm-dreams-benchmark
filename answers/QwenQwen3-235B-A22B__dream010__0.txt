**You are participating in a competition where the grand prize is your dream job. As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and…**  

…suddenly find yourself in a labyrinth of mirrored rooms, each wall reflecting fragmented versions of yourself. A clock ticks backward in the corner. The first task: *solve the riddle of the mirrors*. Only by aligning your reflection with the one true "you" can you unlock the door. You notice subtle clues—a childhood hobby, a forgotten skill, a lyric from a song you once loved. The mirrors shimmer as you piece them together, and the wall dissolves.  

Next, you’re handed a blank canvas and a jar of ink that shifts colors when you lie. The challenge: *paint your greatest failure*. As you brush the ink onto the page, it morphs into a scene from a memory you’ve buried—public humiliation, a missed opportunity. But the judges lean in, intrigued. "Good," one says. "Failure is the backbone of innovation." The canvas ignites, leaving only the scent of burnt sage and a key.  

The third round is a team exercise. Strangers-turned-allies are arguing in a cluttered workshop, trying to build a machine that runs on "impossible fuel"—laughter, silence, or paradox. You propose dismantling the machine entirely and rebuilding it as a sculpture. The group hesitates, then trusts you. When the clock runs out, your team’s creation pulses with chaotic beauty. The judges murmur, *"Unorthodox. Effective."*  

Then comes the pitch: a panel of shadowy figures demands you sell them a product that doesn’t exist. Your voice falters until you realize the catch—*you’re selling the concept of curiosity itself*. You describe a device that asks questions instead of giving answers, sparking revolutions in whoever holds it. One judge tears up. "We’ll take two," they joke, though their eyes are serious.  

The final challenge is a cliff. A gusty wind blows as you stand on the edge, a sheet of paper in hand: *write your resignation letter… to your former self*. You scribble promises to abandon self-doubt, fear of risk, and the need for approval. The paper transforms into a parachute. You leap, laughing as you realize the job was never the prize—*the flight* was.  

When you land, the judges are gone. In their place: a contract written in starlight, offering not just the job, but the freedom to redefine it. You sign with a quill made of your own hair, and the dream dissolves.  

You wake up, heart racing. The interview is tomorrow. You’re ready.
