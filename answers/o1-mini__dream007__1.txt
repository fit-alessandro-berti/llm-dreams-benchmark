As the tension between you and your friend escalates, you decide to take a deep breath and suggest stepping outside for some fresh air. Reluctantly, they agree, and together you walk out into the quiet night. The cool breeze helps to calm your nerves, and the distance gives both of you space to reflect. Under the soft glow of a streetlamp, you start to express your feelings more calmly, explaining why the issue matters so deeply to you. Your friend listens intently, and slowly, the anger begins to dissipate. You both realize that your friendship is more important than the disagreement. By the time you return indoors, there's a renewed sense of understanding and mutual respect. The dream ends with a heartfelt embrace, symbolizing the strength of your bond despite the challenges you face together.
