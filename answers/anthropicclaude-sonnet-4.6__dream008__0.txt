You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you...

...look down at your desk and notice it has transformed into something vast and strange — a surface that stretches out like a prairie, covered not in papers but in luminous tiles, each one glowing with a different color. Your hands look normal but when you reach for your keyboard, your fingers pass right through it like smoke.

Your boss is still watching. Somehow you know this without turning around. You can *feel* the expectation radiating off them like heat from a lamp.

You try to speak — to say *I'll get right on it* — but your voice comes out as music. A single clear note that hangs in the air and slowly becomes visible, a golden thread drifting toward the ceiling.

The deadline, you somehow understand, is **four minutes ago**. It has already passed. And yet no one seems troubled by this except you.

You shuffle through the luminous tiles looking for your project file and instead find:

- A photograph of a door you've never seen
- A list of names written in your own handwriting that you don't remember writing
- A small compass that spins and spins and never settles

Your boss leans close and whispers something important — something that would explain *everything* —

And just before the words reach you...

**your alarm clock pulls you back.**

You wake with the absolute certainty that you almost understood something.
