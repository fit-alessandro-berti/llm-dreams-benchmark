... symbols etched all over its surface. They seem almost familiar, like a language I'd once known but completely forgotten.  As I trace one particular symbol, a coiled serpent biting its own tail, a faint *click* echoes within the box.  The symbol sinks slightly inward, like a button. My heart pounds.

I continue tracing other symbols, experimenting.  A crescent moon, pressed gently, causes a whirring sound, almost like gears shifting inside. A stylized eye, when I push it with my fingertip, elicits a low hum that vibrates through the wood.  It's a puzzle, and each symbol is a piece of it.

The dream shifts. Now I'm surrounded by a swirling nebula of colors, indigo and violet, shot through with streaks of gold. I hear a whispering voice, too faint to understand the words, but the tone is urgent.  The nebula coalesifies, drawing back, and I see… *myself*, but older, maybe by ten years.  My older self is holding an identical box, only this one is open. Inside, instead of treasure or jewels, there's a shimmering, swirling vortex of the same nebula I just saw.

Older-me looks at me with a mixture of sadness and determination. She mouths a single word – or is it two? – that vanishes into the echoing silence of the dream before I can grasp it. Then she *pushes* me, gently but firmly, towards the vortex. I feel a rush of air, a sensation of falling, and the box in my hands becomes intensely cold, then burning hot…

Then, the symbols on the box rearrange themselves. They morph and flow like liquid metal before settling into a new configuration. This time, I see a clearly defined path, a sequence of symbols to press in a specific order. It's as if the dream itself is guiding me, showing me the solution. With trembling fingers, I begin the sequence…
