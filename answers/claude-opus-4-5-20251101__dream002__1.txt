*the air thickens with electricity*

I feel the pressure drop in my chest before I see anything change. The birdsong stops mid-note, as if someone pressed pause. The trees—which were swaying gently—now stand impossibly still.

Then the sky turns the color of a bruise.

I start walking faster, but the path beneath my feet has become unfamiliar. Each step takes me somewhere I don't recognize, though I'm certain I haven't turned. The wind arrives all at once, carrying the smell of rain and something older—like stone, like deep water.

Lightning splits the sky, but it doesn't fade. It *stays there*, a bright fracture hanging frozen above me. In its light, I notice the trees have faces now. Not carved—grown that way. They're watching me with something like concern.

A door appears between two oaks. Just a door, standing alone, painted red and slightly ajar. Warm light spills from the crack. I can hear something from inside—music, maybe, or a voice I almost recognize.

The first drops of rain hit my skin, but they're warm. Almost like tears.

I reach for the door handle...

*and here the dream leaves me a choice*

Do I open it? Do I stay in the storm? Or do I wake up just before my fingers touch the brass?

What would you have me do?
