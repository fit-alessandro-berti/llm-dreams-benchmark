a blank canvas hovering in mid-air, its edges fraying like whispers of smoke. The surface isn't truly blank—up close, you see faint ripples of what might be memories, or perhaps echoes of forgotten thoughts, pulsing faintly in hues of indigo and molten gold. You reach out, your fingers trembling with the weight of possibility, and as your skin brushes the fabric (for it feels like fabric, cool and alive), the canvas awakens.

Colors bleed from your touch, spilling outward in wild arcs: rivers of crimson that twist into serpents, coiling around your wrists like affectionate vines; swirls of emerald that bloom into fractal forests, where trees whisper riddles in languages of light. Shapes emerge unbidden—a clock with hands that spin backward, melting into a flock of paper birds that take flight, their wings etched with equations for dreams unsolved. You laugh, or maybe it's the landscape laughing through you, as the ground beneath your feet warps into a mosaic of eyes, each one winking secrets from parallel worlds.

Deeper in, the canvas grows, enveloping you like a lover's embrace, and suddenly you're painting with your breath: exhaling storms of sapphire that rage and calm in the same instant, inhaling shapes that solidify into companions— a fox with fur of shifting sand, a lantern that hums forgotten lullabies. But as the dream crests, a shadow unfurls at the edges, not threatening but inviting, a void where the canvas folds back on itself, revealing the blankness anew. What will you paint next? The choice dissolves into color, and you wake—or do you?—with the taste of eternity on your tongue, the canvas tucked safely in the folds of your mind, waiting for the next slumber to unfold.
