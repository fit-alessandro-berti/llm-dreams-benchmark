You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak. But suddenly, the words escape you, and you're left standing in silence. Then, taking a deep breath, you remember that this isn't a test—it's your opportunity to share your passion. You start again, this time with confidence, speaking about your ideas with clarity and enthusiasm, captivated by the attentive audience before you, feeling the power of your voice finally free.
