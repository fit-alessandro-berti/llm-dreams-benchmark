…intricate patterns that seem to shift when you’re not looking directly at them, like fish darting just beneath the surface of dark water. They’re not carved; they’re alive, etched in some kind of liquid metal that breathes.  

You tilt the box and the patterns ripple outward from the center, forming a perfect spiral that tightens into the shape of an eye. The eye blinks. Once.

A low hum starts inside your ribs, not the box (you). The lid feels warm now, pulsing in time with your heartbeat. There is still no keyhole, no clasp, no seam… yet you understand, with the absolute certainty that only exists in dreams, that it was never meant to be opened from the outside.

You press your palm flat against the top.

The patterns rush up your arm like black ivy, wrapping around your wrist, your forearm, your elbow. They don’t hurt. They feel like recognition. The box dissolves (no, it folds inward) into your skin, becoming a tattoo of shifting silver across your chest. The weight is gone, but something else has settled behind your sternum: a second heart made of locked rooms.

You exhale, and the air tastes like the moment before waking.

Somewhere in the distance, a key turns in a lock that was never there.

And you realize the box wasn’t containing anything.

It was waiting to be let in.
