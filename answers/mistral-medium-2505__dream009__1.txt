**Dream Completion:**

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find a way to survive and adapt to this unfamiliar world.**

The air smells different—earthy and untouched by pollution. The buildings, if any, are made of stone or wood, and the people (if there are any) wear clothing unlike anything you’ve seen before. You have no money, no phone, and no way to prove who you are.

Your first instinct is to **find shelter and food.** You notice a small village in the distance, but you’re unsure if they’ll welcome a stranger. As you walk closer, you hear the sound of a blacksmith’s hammer and the murmur of a marketplace. A child spots you and runs to fetch an elder, who eyes you with curiosity.

You realize you must **learn the language, the customs, and the skills needed to thrive here.** Maybe you’ll become a farmer, a healer, or even a storyteller—someone who bridges the gap between your old world and this new one.

But as the sun sets, you wonder: **Is this a dream, or have you truly traveled through time?** And if so… will you ever find your way back?
