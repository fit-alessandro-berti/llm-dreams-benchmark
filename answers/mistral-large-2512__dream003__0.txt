**The Dream Continues…**

The patterns on the box shift beneath your fingertips—swirling like ink in water, forming shapes that seem to breathe. One moment, they resemble constellations; the next, they twist into ancient symbols you almost recognize. A faint hum vibrates through the metal, as if the box itself is whispering.

Then, the air grows thick. The room around you blurs, and suddenly, you’re no longer standing in your familiar space. You’re in a vast, dimly lit chamber, its walls lined with shelves of identical locked boxes—each humming in harmony with yours. At the center of the room, a figure cloaked in shifting shadows turns toward you. Their face is obscured, but their voice is clear, like wind through leaves:

*"You’ve found the first key."*

You look down. The patterns on your box have rearranged themselves into a single, glowing line—a seam. With a deep breath, you press your palm against it. The metal warms, then parts like liquid, revealing not a hollow interior, but a mirror. Your reflection stares back… but it’s not *you*. It’s a version of you from another time, another place, holding a key made of starlight.

The figure steps closer. *"The box doesn’t hold what you seek. It holds what you’ve forgotten."*

A question burns on your lips—*What have I forgotten?*—but before you can speak, the chamber dissolves. You’re back where you started, the box now cold and silent in your hands. The patterns are gone. Only a single word remains, etched into the surface in a script you somehow understand:

**"Remember."**

Then, the dream fractures. You wake with a gasp, your fingers clutching the edge of your blanket—only to realize, with a jolt, that the box is still there. On your nightstand. Real.

And it’s *open*.

**What do you do next?** (Do you look inside? Touch the mirror? Or does the dream spiral further?)
