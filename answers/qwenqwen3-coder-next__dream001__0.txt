You start to walk, boots echoing on rain-slicked cobblestones that gleam like oil under a bruised twilight sky. The city sprawls in impossible layers—buildings twist into spirals of brass and obsidian, bridges arch like ribbons of light between towers that melt at the top into clouds. No signs. No people. Just the soft *hiss* of distant steam and the smell of ozone and burnt sugar.

Then, a whisper—not sound, but * knowing*—flows up your spine: *The meeting is where time bends.*

You follow it. Down a lane lined with shop windows showing impossible scenes: a girl folding paper cranes that fly into a stormy sky, a barista pouring coffee that rises like a miniature nebula, a clockmaker whose hourglass contains an entire sunset.

At the lane’s end, a door stands alone. It’s made of weathered oak, inlaid with silver runes that shift when you look away. Above it: *Chronos & Co., Temporal Consultants.*

You reach for the handle—cold iron, humming faintly—and push.

Inside, the air is still and thick with the scent of old paper and vanilla. Sunlight streams through a high, arched window, illuminating a single desk. Behind it sits a figure—just a silhouette for a moment—wearing a long coat embroidered with constellations.

They don’t look up. Just place a hand on an open book whose pages ripple like water. A clock on the wall ticks *backward* for three seconds.

“Ah,” they say, voice likePages turning. “You’re *just* in time.”

You glance at your watch—no hands. Just a tiny galaxy swirling in the face.

They finally lift their head. You see their eyes: one gold, one obsidian, both holding galaxies within them.

“The meeting,” they say, tapping the book’s封面, “isn’t *where*. It’s *when*.”

And then the world holds its breath.

What do you do?  
A) Ask what time it is  
B) Look at the book’s title  
C) Bow, remembering the dream-logic rule: *Never correct time, only listen to it*  
D) Reach into your pocket for the key you somehow *know* is there  

*(The clock ticks forward again. One hour. Exactly.)*
