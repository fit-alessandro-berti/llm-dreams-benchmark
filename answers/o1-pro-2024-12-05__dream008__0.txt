You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you can feel their eyes on you—even though you have your back turned. The office around you is almost absurdly detailed: each file folder is color-coded with intricate patterns, the desks are arranged at odd angles, and there’s a rhythmic tapping sound you can’t quite identify. You realize the clock on the wall is ticking erratically, time speeding up and slowing down at random intervals. You try to protest, to explain that the assignment is unrealistic, but when you open your mouth, no words come out—just a strained whisper that nobody seems to hear.

Your boss, who now towers a head taller than they normally would, leans forward with a stern but eerily calm expression. They tell you that if you can’t finish this project by the end of the day, you’ll have to present it directly to the company’s top executives, who are somehow already waiting in the next room. You turn toward your computer, but instead of your usual setup, you find an outdated machine with a green-on-black command-line interface. Typing anything causes the letters to flicker and dissolve before you can make any meaningful progress. A wave of panic rises in your chest, and you can almost taste the tension in the air.

Suddenly, a co-worker you’ve never seen before glides—yes, glides—into your cubicle, their feet not touching the ground. They hand you a single, blank sheet of paper and whisper, “You already know the answer.” Confused, you look down, and a series of symbols begins to fade into view on the page: shapes and lines that shift the longer you stare at them. You blink, and when your vision clears, you’re no longer at your cubicle. Instead, you find yourself at a long conference table set in the middle of a forest clearing. The project is now laid out in front of you—photographs, diagrams, and hand-written notes pinned to the gnarled bark of a nearby tree. The top executives, each wearing a mask of a different woodland creature, are waiting quietly, their eyes focused on you.

As you begin to explain your work, you realize that the impossible deadline no longer matters. Time here is fluid. Words come easily, and the details you were struggling with before now flow seamlessly from your mind to your voice. The masked executives nod approvingly. The project transforms as you speak, morphing into something elegant and complete: a bird of shimmering ink and parchment unfolds its wings from the paper, lifts off, and circles overhead, scattering ink droplets that turn into tiny seeds when they hit the ground. Your boss, stepping out from behind a tree trunk, no longer looks stern—just curious and somewhat proud.

You take a step back and find that the tension in your chest has lifted. Your feet sink slightly into soft moss. The impossible project has blossomed into something alive and wondrous. The dream ends on the feeling that even in the most unreasonable circumstances, creativity and calm persistence can reshape reality.
