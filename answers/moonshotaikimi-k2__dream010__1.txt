…every trial turns the auditorium darker.

ROUND ONE  
A thousand of us sit at long oak desks as the ceiling stretches ten stories upward. The task is deceptively calm: write, in under five minutes, a single sentence that explains why the job matters more than breathing. My hand hesitates—ink droops like a pendulum—until I finally scrawl, Because when I do it, time forgets its arrow and the world feels written in verbs instead of nouns. A gong sounds; my table and half the others dissolve into white sand, and only five hundred remain. The judges are silhouettes, their faces never lit.

ROUND TWO  
The floor tilts 45 degrees beneath us. We must debate a breeze. Some argue breeze is wind’s apology; others claim it’s mouth-to-ear gossip between trees. I speak last, saying breeze is proof that the sky once loved the earth enough to brush its cheek. The gong again; the remaining desks fold into origami cranes that carry away another 250 contestants. Silence balloons.

ROUND THREE  
We find ourselves in a room the size of a city block flooded ankle-deep with coffee. Floating on the surface are every unfinished project I’ve ever abandoned: moth-eaten screenplays, piano études sketched only in sharps, and the ghost-code of software unreleased. We have to rescue the one that still pulses. Chest-deep in bitterness, I wade between half-verses and kernels until I touch the neural network I once code-named “Echo” to predict missing feelings in people’s e-mails. Its LED heartbeat is a dull magenta, so I cradle it to my chest like a wet cat. When the gong strikes, the coffee drains through invisible grates, leaving 125 of us soaked but standing.

FINAL ROUND  
Spotlights carve a black stage. One judge steps forward—she has my mother’s eyes and father’s scar across the left eyebrow. She hands me an hourglass filled with falling mirrors instead of sand. “Turn this one time,” she says, “and you’ll live the life you think you want. Turn it twice and you’ll forget you ever wanted it. Turn it thrice and we see who you are when desire is erased.”  
I flip it once. Mirrors whir. Instantly I’m at the dream job: a sunlit studio where words compose themselves into living light. I’m overflowing with certainty—until I glance at my reflection in the glass wall: the figure is smiling, but the smile is stapled on.  
Second turn. Memories flicker out like candles in rain. I no longer remember why language ever mattered, yet the shape of an ache remains.  
Third turn. Nothing is left but ache and mirrors. The audience, desks, judges, even the night sky evaporate; I stand in an empty circle watching the hourglass hoover its own bottom back into its top. When the last shard clicks into place, a final door appears, labelled both ENTER and EXIT. On its threshold I realize: the grand prize was never a job; it was the clean absence of the desire that invented the contest in the first place. I push the door until it gives the faintest click—  

—and wake up at my real desk, sunrise painting the room the color of unfinished sentences. My hand still feels the weight of the hourglass, but my palm is empty. In the margin of my notebook two new words write themselves the way dreams sometimes do:  
Keep dreaming
