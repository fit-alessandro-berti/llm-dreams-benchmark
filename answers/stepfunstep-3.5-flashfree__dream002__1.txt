...the air turns electric, tingling against your skin. The happy birdsong is swallowed by a low, ominous hum that seems to come from the very trees themselves. The first fat drops of rain begin to fall, but they are warm, almost humid, as they strike your forehead.

The path ahead, so clear moments ago, vanishes into a thickening silver mist that rolls between the ancient trunks. You instinctually seek shelter, your heart hammering not just with fear, but with a strange, thrilling anticipation. You dive under the broad, sheltering canopy of a giant oak, but the protection is illusory. The wind does not howl; it *whispers* in a thousand voices, each one sounding like a memory you’ve almost forgotten.

Then you see it. In a small, suddenly clear circular patch of moss, where the mist thins, eleven perfect mushrooms form a perfect ring. They pulse with a faint, bioluminescent blue light, each pulse syncing with the beat of your heart. The storm is not coming *for* you, you realize with a shiver of understanding. It is coming *from* this place. The peace you felt before was the calm before this very, ancient awakening. The choice now hangs in the charged air: turn and run back the way you came, into the drenching, ordinary rain... orstep into the glowing faerie ring and let the storm reveal what it has always been hiding in the heart of the woods. Your foot lifts, hovering over the glowing moss.
