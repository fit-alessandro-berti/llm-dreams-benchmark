speak, but suddenly, you realize that you’ve forgotten your notes. Panic strikes for a moment, and your mind feels blank. The audience is still looking at you, waiting. You take a deep breath, trying to calm yourself. Then, out of nowhere, a strange feeling of confidence washes over you, as if the words you need are already inside you.

You begin to speak slowly at first, gathering your thoughts. The words start to flow more freely as you connect with the crowd. You talk about the importance of being present in the moment, of embracing vulnerability, and of trusting yourself, even when things don't go as planned. The crowd starts nodding, their eyes lighting up with understanding.

As you continue, the stage around you seems to change. The lights grow brighter, casting a warm glow over the audience. The room begins to feel less intimidating, as if the energy of everyone present is supporting you. You realize that this is not about delivering a perfect speech, but about sharing something real from your heart.

By the time you reach the end, the crowd is on their feet, clapping and cheering. You smile, feeling a sense of accomplishment and peace. You walk off the stage, knowing that you’ve done something truly meaningful, not just for them, but for yourself as well.
