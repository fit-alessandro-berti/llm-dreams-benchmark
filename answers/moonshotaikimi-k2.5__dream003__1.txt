…they're breathing. Not mechanically, not like bellows, but the way sunlight breathes on water—shifting, dappling, alive. You lean closer (though in dreams, leaning often means falling, and you feel that delicious vertigo) and realize the carvings aren't etched *into* the wood; they're swimming *under* its surface, like koi in a shallow pond.

Your fingertip hovers, hesitant. The patterns sense you. They rush toward your warmth, clustering like iron filings to a magnet, rearranging themselves into constellations you almost recognize—architectures from childhood nightmares, the geometry of your mother's laughter, the exact spiral of your own fingerprint captured and magnified a thousandfold.

You touch the box.

The wood isn't wood anymore. It's warm wax, yielding, and your finger sinks in to the second knuckle. No pain—only a sensation like remembering something you'd forgotten you knew. The box *pulses*. Once. Twice. A heartbeat that syncs with yours, then deliberately slows, dragging your own heart rate down with it until each thump feels like tides turning, like centuries passing.

The patterns rise to meet you, blooming into three dimensions. They become hands—not human hands, but the idea of hands, the concept of grasping and releasing—made of hummingbird wings and clock gears and drying rain. They interlace over the lock, not to keep you out, but to show you that the lock was never physical. It was a frequency. A question.

The box asks, without words: *What are you willing to unmake?*

And you understand, with the terrible clarity that only comes in dreams, that the key was never lost. You've been carrying it in your mouth the whole time—a word you haven't spoken since birth, a name that predates your bones. You open your lips to speak it, and the box begins to dissolve into smoke, into snow, into the sound of a key turning in a lock that was inside your own chest all along.

You wake up with your hands pressed together, fingers interlaced, holding nothing—and everything—tight.
