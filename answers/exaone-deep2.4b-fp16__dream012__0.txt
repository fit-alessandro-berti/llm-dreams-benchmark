As the storm raged around you, your hands shook as the crew clustered around you, their faces blurred in the white-out glare. “The compass is spinning, Captain,” muttered young engineer Seraphine, brushing sweat from her brow. “The storm’s curving sideways—like the map is warping beneath our feet.” Your breath hitched. You had sent the crew to repair the damaged compass last night, but today’s chaos was different: the tempest was not merely surging but twisting the sea into a living entity that drew the very air closer to the water surface.  

“You’re wrong,” you said softly, though your voice trembled slightly. “The waves are calmer now—moving away.” You recalled the hull’s weakened sections; a crack had split open, and the surrounding water now slanted downward like a chasm. The storm was not an external threat but a symptom of the ship’s decay.  

Seraphine froze, until you pulled her toward you, directing supplies toward the repair station. “We’re not fighting the storm alone,” you insists. “We’re treating the wounds.” You activated the ship’s secondary containment system—a failsafe designed to expel tidal forces—as the tempest’s hold began to loosening pull. The sound of metal clanking filled the compartment as you directed tendrils of saltwater into the barrier.  

Meanwhile, the crew watched in silent awe. They hesitated first—fear of forgetting what made the sea wild. But when you demonstrated the containment override mid-scramble, their panic dissolved into cautious cooperation. engineer Jett pried the hatch open just as the wave surged past the hull, pouring salt into the air. You smiled wistfully. “See this?” You pointed to the wave receding, then to the crew’s resolve. “The sea will never take what’s here to repair it.”  

Dawn break brought you a reckoning. The storm’s energy had indeed been a distraction; the real threat was the ship’s creaking decay. You spent nights patching cracks with rusted tools and repaired systems, while the crew split supplies to the crew’s rations—and their grunting in satisfaction.  

Midway, the sky darkened again. “Time for reckoning,” you said. “When the ship weakens again, the storm will follow,” you urged, lowering the command wheel to its minimum. The crew flowed into line, their silent vow to preserve every link in the chain.  

On that night, the stars lit their path as the storm passed by.
