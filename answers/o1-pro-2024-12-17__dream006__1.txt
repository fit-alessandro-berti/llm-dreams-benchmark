…speak, but the words feel thick and unfamiliar on your tongue, as if you’re trying out a language you’ve never quite mastered. The microphone in your hand is strangely warm, pulsing faintly like a living creature. You clear your throat, attempting to steady yourself, and finally form a sentence that rises from the murky depths of your mind.

“Good evening,” you say, your voice echoing out into the silent hall. The audience sits transfixed. Though it’s a massive auditorium, the lighting is arranged so that you can clearly see every face: some are people you know—old classmates, long-lost friends, coworkers—while others seem oddly familiar yet impossible to place. A few have features that shift when you look away and back again: an elderly man’s beard changes length, a young woman’s hair color flickers between midnight blue and platinum, and at least one person in the second row is wearing a mask that looks suspiciously like your own face.

You feel a subtle pressure behind you. Turning slightly, you catch a glimpse of a faint shape drifting backstage—a memory or a feeling, half-formed and ghostly. For a moment, you’re certain it’s a version of yourself, wearing the same outfit, rehearsing the same speech, but somehow ethereal and hollow. Yet when you blink, it’s gone, leaving behind a whisper of nerves that travels up your spine.

Your attention returns to the microphone, to the speech you must deliver. You notice that your notes, which you had carefully prepared, are now inked on thin sheets of translucent paper that flutter like moths’ wings between your fingers. The words are there, but they don’t read like what you wrote. They seem to rearrange themselves, letters sliding and morphing as if alive. It’s unnerving, yet strangely exhilarating. You find yourself reading what appears before you anyway, trusting some deeper instinct:

“Before we begin,” you say, voice now calm and confident, “I want to tell you a story about a place that doesn’t exist yet, and may never come to be.” Your audience leans in. You sense their collective anticipation—a warm, electric current that ties you all together.

As you spin your tale, you feel the stage floor become soft beneath your feet, like moss under a forest canopy. You speak of impossible cities where laughter and tears fall as bright-colored rain. You weave images of bridges made of songs and libraries filled with memories that glow like fireflies. Your words paint the air, and you can sense them drifting through the crowd, settling into their eyes like luminous dust. The ink on your papers no longer shifts; it has stilled, and you now trust that the story is exactly what it needs to be.

The audience is completely enraptured. Some lean so far forward that they appear to defy gravity. You notice gentle smiles, tears forming at the corners of eyes, and even subtle transformations: a rose blooming quietly at someone’s lapel, a small bird perched unexpectedly on the railing of the balcony. The world, your world, seems more pliable with each sentence you utter.

You reach the conclusion of your speech, feeling not fear but something more profound—connection. You close by telling them: “This dream I’ve spoken of is ours to shape. Perhaps we cannot build it in waking life, but together, in this moment, we have brought it into being.” You bow your head slightly, and the microphone, now cool and still, slips gently from your hand.

Silence. It’s a silence thick with meaning. Then the applause begins, rolling through the auditorium like distant thunder, and you feel a gentle weight lifting off your chest. The faces, shifting and familiar, smile at you with sincere gratitude. Somewhere behind you, that faint shape flickers once more, then disappears, leaving you alone, fully present, on that softly mossed stage. You have done what you came here to do, and in that instant, you are content.

And then—like all dreams—this one begins to fade. The colors soften, the applause distorts into a distant hum, and the audience’s faces blur until they are indistinct lights shimmering in the dark. You drift upward, weightless, free. The dream breathes its last sigh, and you awaken.
