You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to **panic, your heart pounding against your ribs. You scan the alien skyline – towering glass spires reflecting a bruised purple sunset, bridges weaving impossibly between buildings like ribbons, streets teeming with blurred, faceless crowds. The air tastes like rain and diesel.**

*   **The Clue:** A crumpled, damp piece of paper flutters down from a nearby rooftop, landing at your feet. It's an address: "The Atrium, 999 Celestial Plaza." The name sounds vaguely familiar, like a place you might have passed in a daydream. But where *is* it? The city stretches endlessly in every direction.
*   **The Chase:** You grab a passing commuter. "The Atrium? Celestial Plaza?" you ask, your voice tight. They point vaguely towards the distant skyline, murmuring something about "the new sector" before vanishing into the crowd. You sprint towards the river, hoping the massive plaza might be visible. You weave through crowds, dodge moving walkways, and leap onto a sleek, silent tram that whisks you across a chasm of glittering light.
*   **The Obstacle:** The tram deposits you in a district of monolithic black towers. Street signs are indecipherable glyphs. Time is slipping away. You duck into a coffee shop to catch your breath and check your phone – dead. The barista, seeing your distress, gestures to a public terminal. You frantically search "The Atrium, Celestial Plaza." It exists! Directions load: "Proceed north 6 blocks, left on Nebula Lane, right through the Nexus Arch."
*   **The Twist:** You follow the route, but Nebula Lane is a dead-end construction site. As you curse, a gust of wind whips down an alley, sending a discarded pastry box tumbling. It lands open, revealing not pastries, but a small, intricately folded piece of origami – a perfect miniature of the Atrium building, with a tiny red dot on its roof. Above the dot, barely visible against the darkening sky, a faint neon sign blinks: "ROOFTOP ENTRANCE."
*   **The Revelation:** You look up. Between two towers, a narrow bridge connects to the roof of a much lower building adjacent to the Atrium. A small, unmarked door glows faintly red. You sprint across a service road, scramble up a maintenance stairwell, and burst through the door onto the Atrium's vast, empty rooftop garden just as your meeting reminder pings silently on your (now miraculously charged) phone: **"Meeting in 3 minutes. Location: Celestial Atrium, Rooftop Terrace, Pod C."**
*   **The Arrival:** You stumble onto the terrace. Pod C is a sleek glass enclosure overlooking the city lights. The meeting is already there – a holographic projection shimmering in the center. Your colleagues' faces look concerned. "Finally!" the lead hologram sighs. "We were about to start without you. Now, about the budget projections..."

**The dream shifts.** You're still standing on the rooftop, the hologram dissolving. The city below seems slightly less alien, the lights coalescing into familiar constellations. But the pressure remains. Where *is* this Pod C? And why does the address on the paper now read "Celestial Plaza, The Atrium, 999 *Dreams*"? You realize with a jolt: **You're still dreaming.** The meeting hasn't truly started. The real test is just beginning...
