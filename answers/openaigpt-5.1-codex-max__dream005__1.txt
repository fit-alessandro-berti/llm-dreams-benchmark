…at first you think you'll just duck past them and keep scanning for the one familiar face, but you slow down because something about the groups feels strangely magnetic.

The first knot of people you brush past is a wild little cluster of eccentrics in homemade clothes, telling off‑beat jokes and showing each other sketches, songs, inventions. They don't seem to care whether anyone else approves; they're too busy being themselves. As you watch, you feel the warmth of your own quirks, your own ability to be different.

A few steps later you stumble into a circle of laughing bodies on the dance floor. Someone is spinning with their eyes closed, others are clapping, crying with laughter, someone wipes away tears and gets pulled back into the rhythm. This group is all feeling – joy, sorrow, anger, love – and their openness tugs at you. You feel your chest loosen as you sway with them for a moment.

On the edge of the room, you notice a table where a calm, steady group sits, sharing food, trading stories about where they've come from and what they've learned. They're not your parents, but they have that grounded, supportive energy of people who set boundaries and keep you safe. One pats the seat next to them and for a heartbeat you sit, feeling held.

Near the bar, a cluster of people are bent over notebooks and diagrams, debating routes on a map, comparing strategies for board games, troubleshooting a camera someone has taken apart. Their conversation is precise, practical, curious. You stand with them long enough to remember that you do have the ability to think things through, to solve problems.

And then, in a shadowed corner you’ve been avoiding, is a group you can’t quite make out at first. Their clothes are darker, their voices quieter. When you finally look, you see familiar eyes looking back – the fear, the grief, the anger you’ve tucked away. Your stomach clenches, your instinct is to turn away, but something holds you there. You take a breath and step closer. They don't lunge; they simply make room. As you stand among them, you realize they are part of you too, and as you acknowledge them the whole room seems to breathe easier.

Only then do you spot the one person you came looking for. They've been at the center all along, smiling, as if to say, "You've met everyone. Now we can go."
