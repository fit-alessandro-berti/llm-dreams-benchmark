I grip the wheel, knuckles white against the dark wood, the wind tearing the words from my mouth before I can speak them. Lightning fractures the sky, revealing for a moment the jagged, obsidian cliffs ahead. The compass is spinning uselessly; the stars are gone, swallowed by the churning, bruised clouds.

"Captain!" the first mate screams over the gale, his face pale with the kind of fear that only a veteran sailor knows. "The pumps can't keep up! She's taking water fast!"

I look at them—my crew, faces slick with rain and sea spray, eyes wide and waiting. In the heart of the chaos, I feel a strange, sudden stillness. The storm isn't just weather; it's a living thing, ancient and angry, and it demands a sacrifice.

I open my mouth to shout an order—to turn into the waves, to fight, to hold on—but the dream shifts. The ship groans, but the sound becomes a voice, and the voice is mine. I feel the hull beneath my boots not as wood, but as bone.

"We don't fight the current," I roar, grabbing a rope that feels like a sinew. "We join it!"

I spin the wheel hard to starboard. The ship lurches, almost capsizing, but then she slides into the trough of a wave, riding the dragon's back rather than trying to break it. The crew scrambles, trusting me implicitly.

Suddenly, the water beneath us glows with an eerie, bioluminescent blue. The storm clouds part just enough to reveal a moon that is far too large, hanging heavy and close, its surface scarred with eyes that blink slowly. We are sailing not on an ocean, but on the skin of a sleeping leviathan, and our storm is merely its restless breath.

"Hold on!" I yell, but my voice sounds like the tolling of a bell. "We're going through the eye!"

The ship surges forward, faster than physics should allow, riding the breath of the beast. The terror of the storm fades into a surreal awe as we sail directly into the center of the impossible moon.
