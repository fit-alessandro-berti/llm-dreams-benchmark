...frantically scan my surroundings, taking in the eclectic mix of ancient architecture and sleek, modern skyscrapers. The air is filled with the cacophony of car horns, chatter, and wailing sirens, making my anxiety spike. I pat down my pockets, only to realize I have no phone, no wallet, and no clues to the meeting's location. A crumpled up piece of paper in my pocket catches my attention, but it's just a receipt from a café I've never heard of.

As I stand there, frozen in uncertainty, a vintage tram rattles to a stop beside me. The doors swing open, and a gentle, melodious voice announces, "Azura Square, next stop." A burst of intuition propels me to leap aboard just as the doors are closing. I grab a pole to steady myself as the tram lurches forward.

Inside, the tram is surprisingly empty, except for a woman in a striking, avant-garde outfit, typing away on a sleek, futuristic laptop. She looks up, our eyes meet, and I sense an unspoken understanding. I approach her, and she nods for me to sit.

"Lost?" she asks, her voice a perfect match for the tram's announcement.

I explain my predicament, and she listens intently, her fingers flying across the keyboard. Suddenly, a holographic display flickers to life above her laptop, projecting a 3D map of the city. A pulsing red line traces a path through the maze of streets, leading to a gleaming, silver skyscraper in the heart of Azura Square.

"That's your destination," she says, as the tram slides to a smooth stop. "The meeting is on the top floor. You have 20 minutes. The building's AI, EVE, will guide you through security."

With a nod of gratitude, I rush off the tram and into the bustling square. The skyscraper looms ahead, its entrance guarded by a sleek, humanoid robot.

"Welcome," EVE's voice chimes from the robot's chest. "You're expected. Please, proceed to the elevator. You have 17 minutes."

As I hasten towards the elevator, the robot falls into step beside me, leading me through a security check that's both daunting and eerily efficient. The doors slide open on the top floor, revealing a spacious, minimalist office with a stunning panoramic view of the city.

A figure, obscured by the glare on the window, turns to face me. "Right on time," they say, a hint of a smile playing on their lips. "Let's get started. We have a world to change..."

And as I approach the table, the dream begins to blur, the faces and details fading into the ether, leaving only the lingering sense of urgency and the haunting question: What world were we supposed to change?
