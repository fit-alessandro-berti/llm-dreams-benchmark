 the hardships, you decide to **build a small, solar-powered radio, not to call for help—there is no one left to answer—but to play the old music you remember. Each night, as the mutated wind howls outside your reinforced shelter, you broadcast crackling symphonies and forgotten jazz into the empty bands of the spectrum. It’s a ritual of defiance. Sometimes, in the static between songs, you swear you hear other faint, looping signals—someone else, somewhere, refusing to let the silence win. You smile, tune the dial slightly, and let the music play on.
