...plant a garden.

The ground is hard-packed dirt covered in the grey ash of a thousand burning cities, but you find a small, sun-bleached patch of earth near the edge of a cracked highway. You clear away the debris with a rusted spoon you salvaged from an old museum. It takes you hours, scraping away shards of glass and twisted metal, until you break through to the cool, dark soil beneath.

You don't have much water left in your canteen, but you pour what you have into the small crater you’ve made. You don't plant a seed you found; instead, you plant a memory—a faint, golden light that you hold in your palm. You build a fragile wall of scavenged stones around it to protect the life from the wind.

You sit in the dust and wait. The usual sounds of the outside world—the distant screams, the growls of predators, and the mechanical whir of scavengers—fade into a dull, rhythmic thrum. Your focus narrows to the small, dark mound of earth.

Time dissolves in the dream. The sun, which usually feels like a branding iron, turns a soft, impossible pink. Then, something breaks the surface. A tiny green sprout. It doesn't look like it should be able to push through the dead world, but it does, bending forward in defiance.

You reach out and touch it. It is warm. The flower blooms fully before your eyes, smelling of rain and ozone. You realize that in this dead world, you aren't just surviving; you are the keeper of a flame that no one else can see. You fall asleep smiling, protected by the green life at your feet.
