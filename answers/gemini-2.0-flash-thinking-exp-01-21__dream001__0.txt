panic, a cold dread tightening in your chest.  You try to remember any detail about the meeting – the address, the name of the building, even the person you're supposed to meet – but your mind is a blank slate, frustratingly smooth. You pull out your phone, but there's no signal. The screen flickers, displaying a message in an unfamiliar script that seems to shift and melt before your eyes.

You start to **run, your shoes echoing strangely on the cobblestone streets, which seem to twist and turn in impossible ways. You see people bustling past, but their faces are blurry and indistinct, and when you try to ask for directions, their voices are garbled, like they are speaking underwater. You catch glimpses of street signs, but they are written in the same shifting, unreadable script as your phone.  A towering building looms ahead, its architecture impossibly ornate, with balconies that seem to defy gravity and windows that reflect a sky of swirling, unnatural colours. You think, 'Maybe it's there?' and frantically head towards it.**

You start to **push through heavy, velvet doors into a vast lobby that seems to stretch endlessly in all directions.  The air is thick with a strange, sweet perfume, and the sound of hushed conversations echoes around you, but you can't pinpoint their source. You see no reception desk, no information board, just more corridors branching off into the unknown.  Your heart is pounding now.  You check your watch – only thirty minutes left.  You choose a corridor at random and begin to walk, then jog, then run, the feeling of urgency becoming almost unbearable. The corridor seems to lengthen as you run, the walls closing in slightly, the air growing colder.**

You start to **hear a faint ticking sound, growing louder with each step. You glance around, but see nothing.  The ticking becomes a rhythmic drumming, then a frantic heartbeat, mirroring your own.  Suddenly, a figure emerges from a side passage.  They are tall and slender, dressed in clothes that seem to shimmer and change colour, and their face is obscured by shadow. They hold out a hand to you, and in their palm, you see a single, antique key, glinting in the dim light.**

You start to **hesitate, unsure if you should trust them, but the ticking, the drumming, the sheer panic of the ticking clock overwhelms your caution. You snatch the key from their hand, and as you do, their shadowed face seems to tilt slightly, and you think you see a flicker of something like amusement in the darkness.  They point down the corridor you were just in, and whisper, in a voice that sounds like rustling leaves, 'The meeting awaits.' You turn and run back the way you came, the key cold in your hand, the ticking now deafening, the question of what kind of meeting and what kind of city this is completely lost in the desperate race against time. You run, and run, and run...**
