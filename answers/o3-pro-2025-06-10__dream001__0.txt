…move, but each street you step onto melts into a new one, as though the city is rearranging itself every time you blink. The neon signs overhead flicker with names you half-remember from childhood daydreams: “Yesterday’s Avenue,” “Someday Boulevard,” “Possible Way.” You decide that if the city insists on changing, you’ll change with it, so you begin to jog.

A thin woman on a bicycle veers past, leaving a brief paper trail in her wake. The slips flutter down like oversized snowflakes. You catch one. It’s blank until your thumb touches it; then words seep up from the fibers:

“Your meeting: 57th floor, Clocktower of Echoes.
Ask the street that sings.”

You look up. The next intersection hums—a low, resonant note, as though the cobblestones are tuning forks. When you step onto it, the entire pavement ripples, forming arrows made of vibration. You follow the sound until the street opens into a plaza where pigeons wear tiny conductor batons and flap in synchronized rhythm, keeping time.

At the far side of the plaza stands a spiral elevator with no walls, only a honeycomb of brass rails. Inside waits a bellhop made of folded maps. He tips his cap and asks, in a voice like rustling parchment, “Floor?”

“Fifty-seventh,” you say.

The bellhop nods, and the elevator rises not upward but inward, folding the city around you like the pages of an atlas closing. As you ascend, each “floor” is an era: diners serve memories instead of meals; office workers write letters to versions of themselves that never existed; a library lends out unfinished thoughts. You glimpse them all in passing.

Ding—57. The elevator stops on a platform of ticking gears arranged like lily pads on water. Above hovers the Clocktower of Echoes: a glass prism with clocks for walls, each showing a time that is slightly ahead of the last, spiraling toward a single grand face at the apex. It reads exactly one hour from now.

A corridor of mirror-smoke leads you to a door labeled simply “You.” It opens before you touch it. Inside, the room is half twilight, half dawn, split perfectly down the middle. In the twilight sits a version of you dressed for the meeting, calm and waiting; in the dawn stands another you, hurried and uncertain—exactly how you feel now.

Twilight-You gestures to an empty chair. “Sit. You’re right on time.”

You glance at the huge central clock: it still says you have forty-five minutes. “But the meeting—Who am I meeting?”

Dawn-You answers, voice overlapping with Twilight-You like a stereo echo. “We’re the agenda. That’s why you couldn’t find the location. You had to catch up to yourself.”

On the table rests a single document: a map of the city with a route traced in gold. It’s the path you just ran, loops and all. At the end of the line is a question mark.

Twilight-You slides the map toward you. “Pick your next street. Any will appear.”

You lift your pen, and as the nib touches the paper, the clock’s hands whirl, the room brightens, and you realize the meeting isn’t in an hour—it’s happening every instant you decide where to go.

The dream wavers. Somewhere far off, an alarm clock rings like another floor’s bell. Both versions of you smile and say in unison, “We’ll see you out there.”

You wake up, heart steady, still tasting the neon wind, already planning which street you’ll draw first when the day begins.
