feel a wave of relief wash over you. Grateful for their kindness, you accept their offer with a shy smile. The group, consisting of a cheerful young woman with bright pink hair, an older man with a gentle demeanor, a teenage boy with a skateboard tucked under his arm, and a quiet woman carrying a sketchbook, surrounds you with warm energy. They ask where you’re trying to go, and you realize you’re not entirely sure. All you know is that you’re searching for something—or someone—important.

The pink-haired woman claps her hands excitedly and says, “No worries! We’ll figure it out together. Let’s start by exploring a bit!” The group leads you through the labyrinth of the city, weaving through crowded streets and narrow alleys. The older man points out little details you hadn’t noticed before—intricate murals on brick walls, the smell of freshly baked bread wafting from a nearby bakery, and the sound of a street musician’s violin echoing in the distance. For the first time in what feels like forever, the city doesn’t seem so overwhelming.

As you walk, the teenage boy skates ahead, playfully daring you to keep up, while the quiet woman sketches quick impressions of the scenes around you in her book. She shows you a drawing of yourself standing at a crossroads, looking uncertain but curious. “This is how I see you right now,” she says softly. “Lost, but on the verge of finding something incredible.”

After wandering for what feels like hours, you come across a small, hidden park tucked between towering buildings. It’s a serene oasis amidst the chaos, with a sparkling fountain at its center and ivy-covered benches. The group encourages you to sit and rest for a moment. As you do, the older man shares a story about how he once felt lost in this very city, years ago, until he found his purpose helping others. His words resonate with you, and you start to wonder if the thing you’re searching for isn’t a place or a person, but a feeling—a sense of belonging.

Suddenly, a breeze rustles through the trees, and a small, golden key falls from a branch, landing right in front of you. You pick it up, puzzled, and notice an inscription on it that reads, “Unlock what’s within.” The group looks at you with knowing smiles, as if they’ve been expecting this moment. The pink-haired woman nudges you and says, “Go on, see where it leads.”

You notice a tiny, ornate door in the base of the fountain that you hadn’t seen before. Heart pounding with anticipation, you approach it, the key trembling in your hand. As you insert the key and turn it, the door creaks open, revealing a soft, glowing light. You glance back at the group, who nod encouragingly, their faces full of warmth and pride.

Stepping through the door, you find yourself in a place that feels both unfamiliar and deeply familiar at the same time. It’s a vast, dreamlike landscape of rolling hills under a twilight sky, with stars twinkling brighter than you’ve ever seen. In the distance, you see a figure waiting for you, their silhouette outlined against the horizon. As you walk toward them, a sense of peace fills your heart, and you realize that whatever—or whoever—you’ve been searching for, you’re finally on the right path.

And just as you’re about to reach the figure, the dream begins to fade, leaving you with a lingering feeling of hope and the faint sound of laughter from your newfound friends echoing in your mind.
