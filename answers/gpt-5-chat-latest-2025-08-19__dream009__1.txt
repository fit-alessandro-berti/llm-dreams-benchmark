…adapt quickly if you want to survive. The air feels different here—cleaner, sharper, like the world has only just woken up itself. Your clothes make you stand out, strange enough to draw curious eyes from the villagers nearby. Their attire suggests a time before electricity, before engines—perhaps the 1500s or earlier.  

You take a cautious step into what looks like the heart of a small settlement: a stone well at the center, timber-framed houses with thatched roofs, and smoke rising from narrow chimneys. People pass with baskets of grain, buckets of water, and tools that look handmade.  

It dawns on you: every skill you once relied on—ordering food with an app, flipping a switch to light a room, searching the internet—no longer exists. To survive here you need to:  

1. **Blend in:** Your clothing will mark you as an outsider. Perhaps you can trade or work for more suitable garments.  
2. **Learn their language and customs:** A single wrong phrase could betray your ignorance and cast you as a threat.  
3. **Offer something of value:** While you may not know how to forge metal or plow a field, you *do* have knowledge. You know about basic hygiene practices, ways to preserve food, even primitive science and mathematics.  

As you think this through, you feel a tug on your sleeve. A child with curious eyes stares at you. “Are you from far away?” they whisper. The villagers nearby glance curiously, as if awaiting your answer.  

What you say now could decide whether they welcome you… or fear you.  

👉 Would you like me to continue the dream with a **hopeful survival path** (where you gain their trust) or a **mysterious path** (where your arrival is seen as something supernatural)?
