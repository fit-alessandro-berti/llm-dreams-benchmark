take a deep breath and suggest that both of you take a step back from the debate. The intensity of the argument fades as you find yourselves standing on the edge of a vast, tranquil lake. The water is a mirror, reflecting a pastel sky streaked with the colors of sunset.

You turn to your friend and express that the issue at hand is significant, but your friendship is more so. You both realize that in the dream-like haze, the details of the argument have become fuzzy, and the tension between you dissipates like mist.

The scene shifts and suddenly you're no longer at the lakeside but instead floating effortlessly in a boundless expanse of space, surrounded by twinkling stars and soft nebulas. Here, in the silence of the cosmos, the disagreement seems trivial and distant.

As you drift, a profound understanding settles over you both. The dream has twisted reality, offering a new perspective where the conflict doesn't seem as insurmountable. You reach out, and your friend takes your hand, signaling an unspoken resolution.

The dream swirls again, and now you're somewhere else entirely, laughing together in a field of tall, waving grasses under a bright blue sky. The argument has been left in another dream, in another time, and all that remains is the bond between the two of you, strong and unbroken.
