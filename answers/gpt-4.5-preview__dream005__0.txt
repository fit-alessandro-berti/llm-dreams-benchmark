overhear snippets of intriguing conversations that vanish as soon as you move toward them. Each group seems absorbed in lively chatter, speaking softly so you can't quite grasp their words. Feeling increasingly out of place, you wander deeper towards a room glowing warmly at the far end of the hall.  

As you step inside, the bustling sounds from before fade instantly. Soft golden light fills this space, gently illuminating an elegant marble fountain at the room's center. Standing beside the fountain is the single familiar person you're hoping to find. They smile warmly, gesturing for you to approach. As you move forward, the floor beneath you begins to shimmer, and the room feels oddly expansive, as though boundaries and walls no longer exist.

Just as you are about to greet them, you notice their expression quietly change—curious relief turns into thoughtful anticipation. Before you can ask what's happening, they point toward the fountain. You peer down at the water's rippling surface and suddenly realize its reflection doesn't match yours or theirs; instead, it displays vivid memories, forgotten dreams, and faces of people you've encountered throughout your life and beyond.

Captivated, you reach toward the water, curiosity overpowering hesitation. At the instant your hand touches the surface, the entire scene gently ripples, dissolving into countless fragments of shimmering light, scattering like stars into the nothingness. You find yourself gently floating, weightless and peaceful, wrapped in a comforting sense of boundless clarity—aware that you are awakening, but grateful for having glimpsed the interconnected essence of your dreams.
