It seems like you're in a medieval village. The air is crisp and cool, and the scent of woodsmoke and fresh bread fills your nostrils. The houses are made of stone and thatch, and the streets are narrow and cobblestone. People are going about their daily lives, some carrying baskets of vegetables, others tending to livestock, and a few children playing nearby.

As you walk further, you notice a few key differences from your familiar world:

1. **No Cars or Buses**: Instead of traffic, you see horses and carriages, and people walking or riding on horseback.
2. **No Smartphones or Computers**: Communication is done through letters, messengers, or word of mouth.
3. **No Electricity**: Light comes from candles, lanterns, and the occasional fire. People use candles for reading and cooking.
4. **No Clothing with Technology**: Clothes are made of natural fibers like wool, linen, and silk, and there are no synthetic materials.

You notice a blacksmith's shop nearby. The sound of hammering on metal fills the air. You decide to:

A) Approach the blacksmith to ask for directions or help.
B) Head to the nearest inn to rest and ask about the village.
C) Explore the village further to see if you can find any familiar items or people.
D) Try to find a way to communicate with the locals using gestures or simple words.
