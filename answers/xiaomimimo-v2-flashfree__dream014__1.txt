find yourself in the heart of a bustling city, the noise and lights blurring into a dizzying kaleidoscope. The architecture is impossible—glass skyscrapers twist into fractal patterns, and the streets shift beneath your feet like the treads of a treadmill.

At first, the loneliness is a physical weight. You turn down an alleyway, hoping for a shortcut, but it dead-ends into a wall of glowing moss. Panic begins to rise. Just as you’re about to turn back, a hand gently touches your shoulder.

It’s a group of people, their faces soft and indistinct in the flickering streetlight. One wears a scarf knitted from starlight; another carries a lantern filled with humming fireflies. They don’t ask for your name or where you’re from. They simply see you.

"We know this place," one says, voice like warm honey. "We can show you the way."

You hesitated, but something in their presence calms the static in your mind. You nod. They form a loose circle around you, not to trap you, but to shield you from the city's overwhelming energy.

As you walk, the city changes. The chaotic noise softens into a gentle hum, and the streets begin to flow rather than rush. The strangers point out things you missed before: a staircase that spirals into the clouds, a park where the trees breathe in unison, a café where the coffee steams in the shape of forgotten memories.

"The city isn't hostile," the one with the starlit scarf explains. "It's just loud. You have to listen to its heartbeat."

They guide you to a quiet overlook, a bridge made of suspended glass. From here, the city looks like a living constellation. You realize you aren’t just following them; you’re learning how to navigate this dreamscape yourself.

Then, as dawn approaches—a sunrise that paints the sky in colors you’ve never seen—they begin to fade. Not abruptly, but gently, like ink dissolving in water.

"You don't need us anymore," the firefly keeper whispers. "You know the way."

You wake up with the feeling of warmth in your chest, and the lingering scent of ozone and starlight.
