frantically scramble through the endless piles of paperwork on your desk, hoping to find some clue to begin. But as you reach for a file, the papers start multiplying, spilling onto the floor and swallowing your computer. When you look up, your boss has turned into a giant clock, its hands spinning impossibly fast. The ticking grows louder, echoing in your ears as the office walls begin to stretch and blur. You try to call out, but no sound escapes, and just as panic overtakes you, you realize—you are dreaming. A sudden sense of calm washes over you as the clock stops spinning, everything freezes, and you awaken, heart pounding but relieved to find yourself safe in your bed.
