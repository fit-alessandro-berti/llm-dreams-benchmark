You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find clean water and food, and figure out where – and *when* – you are.**

Here’s the continuation of your dream:

The first thing that hits you is the silence. Not the deep silence of a remote forest, but a *different* silence – the absence of the constant hum of engines, the distant whine of electronics, the whoosh of traffic. Instead, the air is filled with the rhythmic *clop* of horse hooves on cobblestones, the distant lowing of a cow, the clucking of chickens, and the murmur of voices speaking a language that sounds familiar yet strangely accented, perhaps older, perhaps... different.

You sit up slowly, your heart pounding. You're lying on a narrow, slightly lumpy mattress stuffed with what feels like straw. The room is small, dim, and cool. Sunlight streams through a single small window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The walls are rough-hewn wood, unpainted. A simple wooden chair holds a basin of water and a rag. There's no electricity, no light switch, no phone, nothing plastic. The only light comes from the window and a flickering oil lamp on a rough table.

Panic starts to bubble. *This isn't my apartment. This isn't even my time.* You stumble to the window and look out.

The view is jarringly beautiful and utterly alien. Instead of skyscrapers, you see timber-framed houses with crooked roofs, their walls plastered a faded ochre or white. Thatched roofs crown many buildings. Laundry lines strung between houses flutter with linens. In the narrow, uneven cobblestone street below, a horse-drawn cart laden with vegetables clatters past. Women in long, dark dresses and aprons carry baskets. Men in work shirts and trousers smoke pipes near a blacksmith's forge where sparks fly. The air smells of wood smoke, livestock, baking bread, and damp earth. It feels... rural. European? Victorian? Edwardian?

Your stomach growls loudly, a primal sound in the quiet room. Thirst is a dry ache in your throat. *Food. Water. Answers.* You need to find out where you are, who these people are, and how to survive until you figure out *when* you are and how the hell you got here.

You need to **step outside and approach someone, carefully, to ask for directions to the well or a market, and try to gather information without sounding like a lunatic.** Taking a deep breath of the strange, earthy air, you push open the heavy wooden door and step cautiously onto the sun-warmed cobblestones, feeling utterly out of place, a ghost in someone else's past. Your dream continues...
