...need to learn the rules of this world—fast. The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth. Around you stretch narrow dirt paths winding between timber-framed cottages with thatched roofs. People in coarse woolen tunics and leather shoes hurry past, exchanging curt words in a dialect that’s almost English, but not quite. A cart pulled by a weary horse rattles over uneven stones, its wheels groaning like old bones.

You look down and see you’re dressed in scratchy homespun cloth, your hands calloused and smudged with soot. A wooden loom stands in the corner of what must be your dwelling—an empty bread trencher on a crude table, a clay cup of still water beside it.

Then you hear it: the distant toll of a cracked church bell. Three strikes. Panic flickers in the eyes of the townsfolk. A woman pulls her child close. An old man crosses himself.

You remember the story your grandmother used to tell—about a village cursed to relive the same day every hundred years unless someone could break the cycle. *Today*. That day. And you’ve been pulled into it.

You need to find the old well at the edge of the forest—the one they say is bottomless—before the bell tolls midnight. Legend says the only way out is to return what was stolen: a silver locket bearing the crest of the first-born child, buried with the village’s founder who died betrayed.

But you don’t have the locket.  
And no one will trust a stranger speaking strange words.

So you must earn that trust. Learn the tongue. Find the blacksmith’s daughter—she’s the one in the story who knows where the locket was hidden. But time is short. The sun is already sinking, painting the sky the color of a fresh bruise.

And somewhere beyond the trees, a wolf howls—not a beast, but a warning.

You take a breath.  
Then step forward into the dream.
