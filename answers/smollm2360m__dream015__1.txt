The first thing I notice is that my dreams often feature this eerie landscape of desolate wastelands, where only memories now keep life's basic functions alive. The sounds—the creaking of crumbling buildings, the distant howls and screeches of an endless desert haze—are like haunting whispers through the dark of night, urging me to flee from the madness that threatens my existence.

One day, I wake up in a room full of machinery, where all life is gone. Everything seems cold and lifeless, except for this strange contraption humming softly on the counter: a device for detecting unknown hazards called 'Sense Seeker,' which can read all sorts of dangers—electricity, radiation, toxic chemicals, or maybe even...something more? But what's not sensed by SENSE Seeker would make my heart sink.

It seems I've chosen this life not just to survive but also to learn from the past and perhaps find a way out in some mystical vein (no pun intended!). This post-apocalyptic world is like a puzzle box that refuses to let me rest yet, with mysteries more mind-boggling than most.
