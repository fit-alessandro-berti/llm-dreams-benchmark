take a deep breath and step back for a moment. The room around you starts to shift—walls bend, colors swirl, and suddenly you are no longer where you were. Instead, you find yourself standing on the shore of a vast, glowing ocean under a sky filled with swirling constellations. Your friend is still beside you, but their features flicker like an image in water.

The argument feels distant now, like something belonging to another world. You reach out, trying to ground yourself, but your hand passes through the air as if you are made of mist. Your friend looks at you with wide eyes and says, "We're dreaming, aren't we?" Their voice echoes strangely, as if coming from everywhere at once.

Then, the ocean begins to rise. A massive wave, shimmering with light, lifts you both into the air. Instead of fear, you feel a strange exhilaration—as if you are being carried toward something important. The sky above opens, revealing a doorway of cascading stars.

Your friend turns to you, their face now fully clear. "Do we go forward?" they ask, extending a hand.

What do you do?
