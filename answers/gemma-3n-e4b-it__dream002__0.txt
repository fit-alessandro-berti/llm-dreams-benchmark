You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air thickens, heavy with the scent of ozone and damp earth. The sunlight, just moments ago dappling through the leaves, vanishes, replaced by an oppressive grey. The cheerful chirping of birds is abruptly silenced, swallowed by a low, guttural growl that seems to emanate from the very trees themselves. 

The leaves on the branches, once a vibrant green, begin to ripple and twitch, not from wind, but as if sensing something unseen.  A fine mist starts to fall, clinging to your skin and chilling you to the bone. It smells not of water, but of something… metallic, like old blood and iron.

Then, the trees themselves begin to *shift*.  Not violently, but subtly. Their bark seems to swirl and twist, and the branches lengthen, reaching out like skeletal arms. The familiar shapes of oak and maple warp and distort, becoming something…other.  

A single, enormous eye opens in the trunk of an ancient beech, its pupil a swirling vortex of emerald and gold. It doesn't blink, doesn’t judge. It just *observes*.  A feeling of profound, ancient power washes over you, both terrifying and strangely comforting.

The growl intensifies, now a chorus of voices, too low to understand but resonating deep within your chest. They are not angry, but expectant, as if something is about to be revealed.  

And then, the ground beneath your feet begins to tremble.  You look down and see the forest floor isn't soil, but a mosaic of shifting, obsidian tiles, reflecting the growing storm above like a fragmented, distorted mirror. 

You realize you're not just in a forest. You're in a place *between* places, a gateway. And the storm isn't just weather. It's a veil being torn, revealing… something else.  You feel an irresistible pull, a silent invitation, urging you forward towards the heart of the storm and the watchful eye in the tree.  You take a hesitant step… and the obsidian tiles beneath you begin to glow.
