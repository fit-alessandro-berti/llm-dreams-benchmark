look around, hoping to spot a landmark or someone who might help. The streets are crowded with people moving swiftly in every direction, their faces a blur of unfamiliarity. Billboards in languages you don't recognize flash overhead, and the architecture is unlike anything you've seen before—sleek, angular, almost alien.

You pull out your phone, but there's no signal. Panic begins to rise in your chest, mingling with a strange sense of curiosity. You decide to follow a group of people who seem to be heading purposefully toward a towering glass building at the city's center. As you approach, you overhear snippets of conversation in a language that sounds almost musical, but you catch a few familiar words: "meeting," "now," "urgent."

At the entrance, a friendly-looking woman notices your confusion and offers to help. She smiles reassuringly and gestures for you to follow her. She leads you through winding corridors and up a series of moving walkways until you arrive at a spacious atrium filled with people waiting in small clusters. On a digital display above the doors, your name appears in glowing letters.

Relieved, you take a seat, heart still pounding, and as you wait, you can't help but wonder: how did you know where to go in the end? And what will happen at this mysterious meeting? The dream lingers on the edge of anticipation, the city's strange lights flickering through the atrium windows as you prepare to step into the unknown.
