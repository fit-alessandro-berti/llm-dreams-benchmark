follow them into a shimmering alleyway that wasn't there before. The city morphs around you—skyscrapers twist into giant candy canes, streets ripple like chocolate rivers. The strangers' faces shift: one becomes a talking fox, another a flock of glowing butterflies. They lead you to a hidden door in a wall of clouds, whispering, "Home is where the dream bends." You step through, and suddenly you're floating in your own bed, the city's hum fading into your alarm clock's gentle buzz. You wake up smiling, the loneliness a distant echo. Sweet dreams! 🌙
