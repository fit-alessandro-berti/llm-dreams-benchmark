The wind, gentle moments before, whips into a frenzy, whipping leaves into a chaotic dance around my feet. The sun, a warm presence moments ago, is swallowed by churning, charcoal-grey clouds that blot out the world in an ominous darkness. Fat raindrops, at first hesitant, begin to hammer down, swelling into a torrent in seconds. I raise a hand to shield my face, the cool water stinging my skin.

The air crackles with a palpable tension, and a low rumble echoes through the forest, growing into a deafening crescendo. Straight ahead, the towering trees begin to sway violently, their roots straining against the earth. One, weakened by the storm's fury, groans and cracks, crashing down with a terrifying thud.  Debris flies everywhere, sending shivers down my spine.

Panic rises within me, a primal fear clawing at my throat. But then, I see it. Through the blinding rain, a faint, shimmering light emanates from deeper within the forest. A beacon, drawing me forward despite the storm’s wrath.

My heart pounding against my ribs, I run towards the light, dodging fallen branches and racing through the downpour. The wind screams around me, trying to tear me back, but something within me, a primal instinct I can’t explain, keeps me moving forward.  

The light grows brighter, pulsating with an ethereal glow.  As I burst through the last curtain of trees, I see it - a glowing, swirling vortex of energy, suspended in mid-air.  Thunder roars, shaking the very ground beneath my feet, and the vortex expands, reaching out towards me, its light seeping into my skin.  

Fear turns to awe. This is not an ending, I realize, but a beginning.  The storm is a doorway, and I am about to step through.  




What happens next?
