### You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need **to survive and understand your new reality.**

The air is thick with the scent of earth and burning wood. The sky stretches endlessly above you, unmarred by the glow of city lights or the hum of machines. You blink, trying to adjust to the dim, natural light filtering through the trees. Your clothes feel strange—coarser, heavier—and your hands are caked with dirt you don’t remember getting. You look around, and the world feels both ancient and alive.

There are no phones, no cars, no electricity. Just trees, grass, and distant animal calls. A small, thatched hut sits nearby, its door slightly ajar, smoke curling from the roof. You approach cautiously. Inside, you find a simple stove, a few clay pots, and a rough wooden table. A loaf of dark bread sits on a shelf, along with a small bundle of herbs. It’s clear you’ve been expected—or perhaps someone lived here before you.

As you step back outside, you notice footprints in the mud leading away from the hut. You follow them, careful to stay quiet. The forest is dense, alive with the rustling of leaves and the occasional snap of a twig. You hear voices—human voices—carried on the wind. They sound far off, but they give you hope.

You realize you need **three things above all:**

1. **Food and Water** – You feel the first pangs of hunger. The forest offers berries, perhaps edible plants, but you don’t know which are safe. A small stream winds through the trees nearby—could it be drinkable? Or will you need to purify it somehow?

2. **Shelter and Safety** – The hut is a start, but it doesn’t feel entirely secure. Animals could wander in. Worse, other people might—not all of them friendly. You need to make sure the hut is defensible, or find another place to stay for the night.

3. **Knowledge and Clothes** – Your modern garments stand out like a beacon. You’ll need to blend in, not just for survival, but perhaps to avoid suspicion or worse. And you need to understand *when* you are. The tools, the way people dress in the distance, the language you hear—it all feels old. Are you in the Middle Ages? Earlier?

As the sun begins to dip below the treetops, casting long shadows across the forest floor, you hear a horn blow in the distance—a deep, resonant call that makes your heart skip. It sounds like a signal. Someone is calling a meeting, or warning of danger.

You have a choice:  
- **Return to the hut and begin gathering food and making it more defensible for the night.**  
- **Follow the sound of the horn and seek out the source—perhaps you’ll find others, learn where you are, and what expectations people have of you.**  
- **Explore the nearby stream for drinking water and search for edible plants, hoping to avoid confrontation until you know more.**

Which path will you take?
