…intricate patterns and faint grooves spiraling toward a tiny circular plate at the center. The metal is warm, almost pulsing, as if the box itself is breathing. When you tilt it toward the light, the patterns shift—**not reflect—shift**, rearranging themselves like living ink.

You run your thumb across one of the grooves, and the entire box suddenly vibrates with a low, harmonic hum. The circular plate glows softly. You pull your hand back, startled, but the glow intensifies, spilling threads of gold light between the seams.

Then you notice something impossible: the patterns now form **words**—in a language you don’t understand, yet somehow *recognize*. As you focus, the letters blur, twist, and reorder into a message you can read:

**“The key is not found.
The key is remembered.”**

Immediately, your mind tingles with a half-forgotten feeling, like recalling a childhood melody. The box responds to your memory—whatever it is—and the circular plate opens like an iris, revealing a swirling mist inside.

The mist expands, stretching outward until it becomes a doorway—silent, shimmering, and expectant.

You feel the pull of it, gentle but certain, as if the box has decided **you are ready**.

What do you do?
