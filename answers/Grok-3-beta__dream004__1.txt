a shimmering brush that seems to hum with potential. You pick it up, and as your fingers graze its bristles, the canvas flickers to life. The colors around you—swirling purples, melting golds, and shifting blues—begin to pour from the brush, splashing onto the canvas in wild, unpredictable patterns. Each stroke you make feels alive, as if the paint is dancing to a rhythm only it can hear. 
Suddenly, the canvas starts to ripple, and the shapes you’ve created—a jagged triangle, a spiraling orb—peel off and float into the air. They twist and morph, growing larger, until they’re towering over you, a kaleidoscope of impossible forms. You step back, awestruck, as the world bends to your creation. A voice, soft and echoing, whispers from the canvas: “What else will you dream?” 
You hesitate, then dip the brush again, ready to paint something even stranger—a creature, perhaps, with wings of liquid light and eyes that reflect the ever-changing sky. What do you choose to bring into this dream next?
