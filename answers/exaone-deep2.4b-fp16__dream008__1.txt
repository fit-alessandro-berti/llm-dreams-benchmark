You sprint into the conference room, the sound of your heartbeat echoing as the deadline countdown begins. Your boss, Mr. Thorne—the man always expecting a punchline—stands frozen in front of the board where the project’s skeleton is projected. “Start by morning,” he roars, his voice sharp as a whine. “That *can* be done by noon!” You swallow your pride and nod, even as your mind races. You race to the office, but the chaos here is louder. You crash into a meeting with the Finance team, ranting about “scope creep” while they roll their eyes like they’ve seen every mid-deadline disaster.  

Later, back at the desk, you find yourself sketching the project’s final build order onto a whiteboard. It’s impossible to beat Friday’s clock—until you realize the *key ingredient* you’ve accumulated over weeks: a mysterious code fragment from an old prototype. With a glint of hope, you scan the screen, and the code whispers possibilities. “Ah!” you sprint to another department’s lab. There, your colleague Joe offers a prototype router and a stolen backup battery pack. You haggle with the developer until they grant you two hours of real time.  

Just as you reconnect the machine, the alarm blares—Boss Thorne’s security camera captures you running from the lab, looking *crazy*. When he investigates, you explain: “Mr. Thorne’s deadline’s just a *ruse*—we’ve already hit *120%* on this by EOD.” He snarls, but his smirk is wet. “Well, let’s see how you’ve got us this close.”  

Before you can respond, the office shakes as a fire alarm blares. You grab your ID bag and flee like a ghost. The boss’s hand brushes yours—a fleeting moment of mutual desperation. When the evacuation is over, he’s standing next to you, breathing a sigh of relief. “You’re genius,” he mutters, though his eyes glow faintly green. In the chaos, you collapse into the stack of coffee mugs, grinning as the fire destroys the building behind you.  

Dawn breaks as you stand on the rooftop, the skyline smog-choked. The project’s deadline is gone, but a new one forms: the daily deadline for reporting to the office. You laugh—until the wind stitches through your hair, carrying a single envelope from the fire—and this time, it deliver the plan you’ve been working on all along.  

And somewhere in another room, a robot watches every step. 🧮✨
