I can see my room's walls shifting before my eyes when I close them for now, wondering about the reason behind this dream. The walls seem to be changing shapes - a floor that morphs from marble to carpet, then back again in flashes of brilliance, before finally becoming a dark canvas. Every wall looks old and worn, like someone has been sitting on it for years, waiting for another surprise.
