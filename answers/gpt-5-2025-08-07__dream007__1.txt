…take the argument out of your mouths and put it on the table like a heavy, shivering animal.

It sits there between the two of you, breathing fast, fogging the varnish. The room is too small for the two of you and the animal both; the walls lean in like spectators. Your friend’s eyes are bright with the kind of hurt that feels almost hot to be near. Your own heart is a drum you can’t stop.

“Fine,” you say, although your voice comes out as two voices overlaid, the one you intend and a child’s whisper. “Let’s look at it.”

You unzip the argument along its spine. Out spill feathers, receipts, a small pocketknife, a key that doesn’t remember its door, and a folded map with the places you never talk about marked in red thread. There is also a glass jar with a crooked label that reads blame in someone else’s handwriting. Inside the jar is a tiny moon, cloudy and egg-sized, knocking softly against the glass with every breath either of you takes.

Your friend reaches first for the map. It’s damp, as if it has been carried under a coat through rain. When they unfold it, the paper becomes a window, and behind the window is a younger version of them, standing in a hallway lit by a single bulb. The young them puts a palm to the glass. You feel it, even from here. You put your palm to the other side. The glass is cool. Something in your chest loosens with a small, reluctant sound.

“Why won’t you ever just listen?” your friend asks, but when they say it, the sentence turns into a flock of moths that circle the overhead light. They land on the lightbulb and their wings are printed with tiny words: scared, tired, mine, please. Each word flutters, unreadable until it’s still.

You go to open the jar the way you have in the past, to let the blame out and let it fly around the room until it exhausts itself, but when you twist the lid, it resists, and in the struggle the moon inside knocks harder. Its soft, persistent tapping you recognize as you. The you that isn’t interested in winning, only in not being erased.

“Outside,” you say. “Let’s take it outside.”

The two of you carry everything—map-window, jar-moon, the feathers, the receipts with coffee dates and unkept promises printed in small, accusing numbers—out into the night. The air tastes like metal, like coins on the tongue. The neighbor’s dogs are asleep in porch chairs, arranged like judges at a trial who have already delivered their verdict and found both of you guilty of being alive.

You tip the jar into the dirt of the garden. The blame doesn’t spill; it pours as salt and starlight mixed together, a glittering cascade that patters onto the soil and dissolves. The moon inside the jar shrinks to the size of a pearl and then to a seed. You plant it with the back of your hand, because your palms are too tired, and cover it with one of the feathers. Your friend kneels beside you and presses their fingers in too, and for the first time tonight your hands brush without sparking.

“Do you remember,” your friend says, very carefully, as if stepping between glass on the floor, “how we used to build forts and call the inside ‘safe’? I wanted that. I still want that.”

“I wanted to be allowed to go outside the fort sometimes,” you say. “And not have you think I was leaving you.”

“Yes.” They sit back on their heels. Their face is both older and softer than it was in the kitchen. “I know.”

You look at the argument, which is now sniffing the garden like a curious fox. Its back rises and falls; its tail is a cable of wires and vines. It glances at you with one eye that is yours and one that is your friend’s, and you realize with a little, ridiculous burst of relief that it is smaller out here. The sky does that dream-thing and opens like a lid, and a wind slides in that smells like a lake you swam in once when you were twelve, the cold kind that made your teeth ache with joy.

“Show me,” you say. “No words for a minute. Show me.”

Your friend nods. They take their worry out of their mouth and shape it in the air with their hands. It is a nest, woven of impatience and tenderness and a history of being left behind. You recognize the weave; you have used those same sticks. You take your own worry out too and it comes as a glass dome, clear and protective, set too close to the thing it covers, fogging it until it disappears.

You bring the nest and the dome close to each other. The fox-argument sits between them. It yawns, long and red. Out of its mouth drops something you hadn’t remembered was in there: a small blue egg with a hairline crack.

The two of you crouch on either side of it. Your friend holds the nest in both hands. You hold the dome in yours. The egg sweats, perhaps from effort, perhaps from all the breath you have been throwing at it. Something inside knocks, soft and persistent, the way the moon did.

“It’s not about which of us gets it,” you say, surprised to hear yourself speaking gently. “It’s about it getting what it needs to be.”

“And about us not breaking it while we decide,” your friend says, and their voice gentles too, the words walking barefoot now.

You set the dome at an angle so air can reach. They set the nest beneath so there is something to hold. Your hands are almost touching, not quite. Your thumbs mirror one another without meaning to, making a little gate.

One more knock and the egg opens raggedly. Out comes not a bird, not exactly. It is a piece of music with feathers, a warm draft with a backbone. It sits there shivering and then, when you both fall quiet without meaning to, it sings. The song is tiny and patient. It is the note you hummed to yourself the day you met, and the squeak of the floorboard by your friend’s bedroom window, and the sound of your names in a mouth that loves you.

The fox-argument curls up, sighs, and becomes the jacket draped over the back of a chair. Without the fox pacing between you, the space changes shape. The night isn’t an adversary anymore; it is a cloth hung to dry, and in the distance someone is walking home with a bag of oranges that knock softly together like small suns.

On the ground, where you planted the seed of the moon and tucked it under a feather, a thin stem pushes up. It is too early for leaves, but there they are anyway: two pale coins, trembling with belief. Your friend touches one with a fingertip, as if asking permission. You touch the other.

“We’re both afraid,” you say, to the plant, to the jacket, to the little song that has decided to be alive between you. “Of doing this wrong.”

“We probably will,” your friend answers, and then, because it’s both brave and funny and true, you both laugh, but the kind of laughing that makes your ribs ache not in defense but in relief.

The moths that had been beating themselves senseless against the porch light drift away toward the dark, where they belong, and the light softens. A train passes, or maybe it’s wind through trees, or maybe it’s the sound of your pulse easing up the tiniest bit.

You gather the receipts and fold them into boats and set them sailing on the puddle that has formed in the low place by the steps. Your friend takes the knife and cuts the red thread off the map-window. When it’s free, the glass becomes just paper again, and the younger version of them on the other side lifts their hand and walks away down a hallway that gets brighter as they go.

“Come back in,” your friend says after a while, the way they used to say it during summer thunderstorms when you both wanted to stand under the downspout and swallow the rain.

“In a minute,” you say, the way you used to say, because you want to watch the tender thing in the dirt and the boats skimming their reflected stars.

You both stand there in the softifying night, shoulder to almost shoulder, and the argument, out of tricks and teeth, is at last only a warmth resting where your spine needs it. Somewhere a bird that should be asleep is awake, rehearsing.

Later you will wake with salt on your lips and the imprint of a feather in your palm you won’t be able to explain. But for now, because this is a dream and you have decided, the two of you stay until the first rim of light appears at the edge of the garden like a coin rising, and the small plant turns its not-yet-leaves toward it with shameless hope. You breathe with it, together. You decide, again and again, to stay.
