You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak—but the words that come out aren't yours.

Instead, the voice that fills the auditorium is deep, ancient, and resonant, as if it has been waiting centuries to be heard. The lights dim to a soft amber, and you notice that the audience members are no longer simply sitting—they are listening with their whole bodies, leaning forward, some with tears streaming down their faces they don't seem to notice.

You try to stop, to control what's happening, but your mouth continues moving. The speech is not about politics or motivation or any topic you ever studied. It is a story about a door. A door that exists in every building, in every heart, in every moment between seconds—a door that most people walk past their entire lives without seeing.

"The door is not locked," your alien voice explains. "It is merely hidden by the weight of what you believe is real."

The stage beneath you begins to shift. Floorboards rise and fall like the ribs of some sleeping giant, and you realize the entire auditorium is alive, breathing, listening. The ceiling has become a sky filled with stars that are not stars—but eyes. Watching. Waiting.

You feel yourself disappearing, dissolving into the speech itself, becoming nothing more than a vessel for something far older than your name, your fears, your small ambitions. And strangely, you are not afraid.

You are finally, completely, heard.
