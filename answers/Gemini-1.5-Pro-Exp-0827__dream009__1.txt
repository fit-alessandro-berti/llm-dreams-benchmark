...find food and shelter. The sun beat down mercilessly, the air thick with the scent of unfamiliar spices and woodsmoke. I was in a bustling marketplace, a chaotic swirl of brightly-colored fabrics, shouting vendors, and animals I'd only ever seen in history books. My clothes, jeans and a t-shirt, drew curious stares. I felt a pang of fear, realizing how utterly out of place and vulnerable I was.  

My stomach growled, reminding me of my most immediate need. I had no money, no skills that seemed relevant in this time. Desperation edged in. Then I saw it - a baker, his stall piled high with fragrant loaves. An idea sparked. I approached him, gesturing wildly and using a combination of broken sign language and the few words of Latin I remembered from high school. I offered to work, to clean, to carry, anything in exchange for a piece of bread. 

The baker, a burly man with kind eyes, seemed to understand. He handed me a broom, a silent agreement passing between us.  As I swept the dusty floor, I observed, learning. The rhythm of the marketplace, the bartering system, the way people communicated without the constant buzz of technology. It was daunting, but there was a strange beauty in the simplicity of it all. 

That night, the baker offered me a corner of his shed to sleep in.  As I lay on the straw-filled pallet, gazing at the star-studded sky, a strange sense of calm washed over me. I was lost, adrift in time, but I was also alive, resourceful, and surprisingly... hopeful.  This strange, new world held dangers, yes, but also the possibility of a fresh start, a chance to discover who I could be without the distractions and comforts of the life I knew. The dream wasn't over, it was just beginning.
