begin to notice that the walls are shifting, rearranging themselves into new patterns each time you solve a puzzle. The air hums with a strange energy, and the soft glow of symbols etched into the stone pulses in time with your heartbeat.

At first, the puzzles seem straightforward—sliding tiles into place, matching glowing runes—but as you progress, they become more intricate. One puzzle demands that you recite a sequence of numbers you’ve never heard before, yet somehow, you know them. Another requires you to step on a pattern of tiles that seem to change as soon as you blink.

Then, you reach a chamber unlike the others. In its center stands a mirror, tall and rippling like liquid silver. As you approach, your reflection steps out of the glass, mirroring your every move but with a knowing smirk. 

"You’ve come far," it says, its voice an echo of your own. "But the final puzzle is yourself."

The walls of the chamber begin shifting, forming symbols that feel familiar yet unreadable. Your reflection holds out a hand, and as you reach for it, a surge of understanding washes over you. The maze isn’t a place—it’s a test. And the answer has been with you all along.

What do you do next?
