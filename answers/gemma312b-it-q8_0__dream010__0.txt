Okay…. *blink, squint, adjust position in a shifting landscape... that’s odd.* Alright, I’m participating in… a competition? Yes! A grand prize? ...My dream job! Right, right. Alright then, where was I? 

The competition progresses… you've said. Yes, indeed it is.

…challenges and… 

… and the challenges have felt oddly specific. Not brute strength; not intellectual puzzles of a strictly linear design; no, these were more… interpretive.

Initially it was judging artistic expressions. We were presented with a chaotic collage—old film stills, feathers, snippets of scientific data scribbled on napkins, and melted ice cream. The prompt: "Transmitting Quiet."  Hundreds competed, offering analyses focusing on negative space, unspoken emotion via color, and quantum entanglement - all impressively detailed. I, hesitant at first, felt a surge and quietly responded simply: "The paused frame.” I pointed at a picture of a moth mid-flight among the disarray and explained how stillness isn’t the absence of movement, but a pregnant breath before a flurry, a microcosm contained in that one moment.  Unexpectedly, it was considered the winning interpretation that round.  My stomach lurched with nervous accomplishment.  That was the start. 

Then came *the gardens*. Not manicured rose bushes or botanical precision. No. These are overgrown, unruly, teeming with life nobody could reliably classify. The challenge: “Find Harmony within Entropy.”  We had to cultivate a small plot within this wilderness, transforming it not into something conventionally "attractive", but by understanding its existing currents, weaving into those pathways like sympathetic water. I didn’t try to tame anything; I studied the paths the rain already charted, encouraged the climbing vines already scaling a twisted tree into a verdant shade screen, subtly diverting a wandering trickle of spring melt into watering an improbable colony of luminous moss. 

The judges—odd looking beings with shifting iridescent eyes — observed impassively. They did not applaud or heckle; their silent scrutiny was more intimidating than shouts. Many competitors had aggressively cut vines, cleared sections, imposed grid patterns—all attempts at control, met with stony disinterest.

The feeling intensified as the rounds whittled down the competition. Each challenge was veiled – more suggestion than command – seemingly probing not for *knowledge*, but for... intuition about things that were almost felt. There was the round with mirrors—not reflecting beauty, but echoing hidden potential within the fragments within them – and another with stones to arrange based not on weight or color, but "narrative.” 

Now I find myself standing within a giant observatory dome, tilted slightly away from the stars it should be facing. The machinery is all obsolete – brass gears and exposed wires hum quietly. Below, sprawling outwards and disappearing from the dome like a fractal pattern, are miniature landscapes – one a vibrant underwater world populated by fantastical fish; another a towering metallic canyon buzzing with what might be alien insectoids. Every landscape is impossibly detailed, and subtly shifting like a movie on pause.

The iridescent-eyed judges emerge from behind columns of obsolete machinery. One steps forward – or… unfolds? They appear less like stepping and more akin to rippling from the air.

“Participant,” it speaks, not with voice audible to the ear but a resonance felt deeply within my bones. “This is the final trial. Each landscape replicates a failed iteration of your dream job - a version you attempted but failed to realize, at some point on your life's path. Your task… not to identify the reason those pathways collapsed, but to… *remember* them. *Embrace* the echo of what you were.”  A spotlight clicks to illuminate a small area near me—filled with dry dust and a faint image… one I recognize vaguely… an archive... filled with stacks upon stacks of handwritten essays… the initial attempt years back for the editor at a publication no longer exists.

Panic blossoms, not of failure, but of recognition. It *is* that. And… and now I feel the pull from those forgotten paths, a poignant wave of nostalgia and quiet loss… and, suddenly, I need to write… but not an elaborate explanation or apology, simply... *remember it, and write that simple feeling*.  The memory, the lost possibility…
…and the first word flows… "almost…” 



Do the judges expect complete fulfillment or acknowledgement of loss itself? Am i nearing a fulfillment or simply experiencing a prolonged remembrance...

(pause to consider, adjusting a non-imaginary blanket)… I'm definitely waking up, aren't I?
