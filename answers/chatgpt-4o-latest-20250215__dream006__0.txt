speak, but no sound comes out. You clear your throat, try again—still nothing. Panic flares inside you as the audience begins to shift uncomfortably, whispering among themselves. 

Then, suddenly, you notice something strange. The words you meant to say are floating in the air before you, shimmering like delicate threads of light. As you reach out to touch them, they rearrange themselves, twisting into new sentences, forming ideas you never planned to express. 

The audience gasps as the words spiral upward, forming glowing constellations in the darkened auditorium. A deep hum vibrates through the space, resonating within you. You feel as if you are being lifted off the stage, carried by the very language you were about to speak. 

Then, just as suddenly, a voice—your own, yet not quite—booms from all around: **"Listen, and you shall understand."** 

The crowd falls silent, their eyes wide with awe. You finally find your voice, but now, it feels different—powerful, limitless. As you speak, the air shimmers, reality bending with each syllable. The walls of the auditorium dissolve into a vast, starry sky. 

You realize: this is not a speech. This is a transformation. You are not just speaking—you are *creating*.
