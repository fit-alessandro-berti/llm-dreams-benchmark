...steady the wheel with white-knuckled hands, your voice cutting through the shriek of the wind and the thunderous cracks of the waves against the hull. "Eyes forward! Hold your lines! This ship has seen worse!"

But you’re not sure it has.

The deck heaves beneath your boots, a living, sickening thing. A wall of black water, caught in the ghostly sweep of the ship's lanterns, rises ahead—a mountain of churning sea. The crew scrambles, clinging to rails and each other, their faces pale ovals of fear in the storm-light. You feel their collective breath, their hope, pinned to your next command.

The wave is upon you.

The *Sea Dragon* groans in her timbers as she pitches upward, climbing the impossible slope. For a suspended moment, the world is only the scream of wind and the terrible silence of the wave's lip curling over the sky. Water surges down the deck, a freezing, clawing river that snatches at ankles and threatens to sweep everyone into the black.

"NOW! HARD TO PORT!" you roar, throwing your weight against the wheel. The ship answers, groaning as she turns her broadside to the wave. The sea crashes over the railing, a tsunami of cold that knocks men from their feet. You are drenched, salt-stung, your soaked coat whipping like a whip-cord around your legs.

Through the deluge, you see your first mate, Elara, already pulling a young deckhand from the torrent, her own body a bulwark against the flow. You see the old cook, Busby, lashed to the galley hatch, calmly bailing with a bucket as if it’s a Tuesday. They are following you *into* the chaos.

The wave passes. The ship, shivering and alive, rights herself. The worst of that crest is gone, but the storm rages on—a endless, heaving dark.

You wipe seawater from your eyes, scanning the deck. No one lost. Not this time. The crew, dripping and battered, begin to stir, looking back to you. They saw the turn. They felt it. The ship held.

The next swell is building, but it’s different. Not a mountain—a long, grinding rise. The kind that tests a keel.

You take a deep breath of wet, electric air. The storm isn’t breaking. It’s settling in. Your voice, when you speak again, is lower, but it carries over the gale.

"Secure the tops’l yards! Double the foredeck lashings! Elara, sound the bilge! We ride this one through. This is our sea. She will not have us."

You feel it then—not just the wind and the wave, but a strange, deep thrum in the wood beneath your feet. The ancient oak of your ship, your home, answering your stubborn will. The sea may be furious, but you are its captain. And captains do not merely survive the storm. They *command* it.

You grip the wheel again, not with fear, but with a fierce, quiet certainty. The next swell is coming. Your crew is ready. The ship is ready.

**What will you do?**
