You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and feel the weight of unfamiliar faces pressing in around you. The room is vast, like a ballroom from a forgotten era, with chandeliers that flicker like stars and music that seems to echo from another time.

You pass a group of people dressed in shimmering, shifting colors, their laughter high and melodic. They invite you to join, but as you step closer, their faces blur and dissolve into mist. You move on, heart racing, searching for the one familiar face.

Next, you stumble upon a table filled with golden plates and silver goblets, but no one is sitting there. The food glows faintly, and when you reach for a slice of cake, it vanishes. A voice whispers, "Only the lost find what they seek here."

You keep walking, weaving through clusters of strangers who speak in riddles and half-remembered dreams. One person offers you a map, but when you look down, it's blank except for your own name written in fading ink.

Finally, in a quiet corner, you spot them—your one familiar face, standing by a window that looks out onto a sky of swirling galaxies. As you approach, the crowd parts like water, and the noise of the gathering fades into silence.

They turn, smiling, and say, "I've been waiting for you." But before you can respond, the dream shifts again, and you wake up, breathless, with the echo of their voice still in your ears.
