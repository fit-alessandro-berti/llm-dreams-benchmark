...start planting seeds. Not just any seeds—sunflowers, tomatoes, and rows of golden wheat, scavenged from an old seed vault I somehow remembered existed. The soil’s cracked, and the sky’s a permanent shade of rust-orange, but I crouch down anyway, cupping damp earth in my hands like it’s a promise.  

I’m not sure why I do it. Maybe because my father once told me, "When you grow something, you’re not just feeding a body—you’re staking a claim on the future." Or maybe I just miss the smell of basil after rain.  

A figure watches from the ridge—hooded, silent. Could be friend or foe. But I keep planting. One seed at a time.  

Do you think they’ll come closer? Or should I?
