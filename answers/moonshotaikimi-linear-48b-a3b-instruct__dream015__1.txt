…You decide to build something—not just survive, but *restore*.

Every day, you scavenge what others overlook: a cracked solar panel dragged from a rusted EV, a child's watercolor set fused to a melted backpack, a single untouched seed in the bottom of a forgotten tin. You don’t hoard. You *remember*. Each fragment is a thread in the tapestry you’re weaving—of hope, of continuity.

You wander the skeletal remains of what was once a city, guided not by fear, but by memory. You speak aloud to no one but the wind, sharing dreams of libraries rebuilt, of children drawing again, of music that doesn’t echo from broken speakers but from real, living throats. You whisper to the ghosts of your past, not in sorrow, but in promise.

One morning, you find a rooftop garden thriving—not by miracle, but by your own slow, stubborn care. You’ve traded canned solemnity for songs. Someone follows your trail, drawn by the scent of growing things. They don’t speak at first. You offer half a bruised apple. They accept.

And in that moment, the world doesn’t feel smaller. It just feels *shared*.

You don’t claim victory. But you plant the seed anyway.
