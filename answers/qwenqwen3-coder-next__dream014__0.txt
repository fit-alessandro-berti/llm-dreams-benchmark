You pause, breath catching—not in fear, but in quiet disbelief. The city’s noise softens, like a symphony tuning itself. A woman with silver-streaked hair and a canvas satchel full of maps smiles warmly. Beside her stands a teenager holding a sketchbook open to a hand-drawn city map cluttered with tiny flowers in the margins. An older man in a worn tweed coat nods and says, *“Every lost soul gets found—sometimes, you just need the right people walking beside you.”*

They don’t ask *where* you’re going. They ask *who* you’re trying to become.

The woman hands you a compass—its needle spins lazily before settling toward a shimmering, impossible light at the city’s edge, where the skyline dissolves into stars. “It only points to *your* true direction,” she says. “Not the one on the map.”

As you walk with them down a cobbled alley that curves like a question mark, streetlights bloom like fireflies. A bakery door swings open, offering warm buns that taste like laughter and forgotten birthday candles. A busker plays a melody on a glass harmonica—liquid, clear, and full of hope—and suddenly, you remember your name. Not the one others call you, but the one your soul whispers when no one’s listening.

The teenager shows you a drawing in their sketchbook: *you*, standing before a great door made of interwoven branches and light, one hand outstretched. “This is where you’ll be,” they say softly. “Soon.”

Then, as you reach the edge of the city, the strangers step back—not离去, but *holding space*. Their faces are already fading into golden mist, but their voices remain, echoing like a lullaby:

*“You were never truly lost.  
You were learning how to ask.”*

You turn, heart full, and find the door waiting—no lock, no handle. Just a soft press of your palm…  
…  
…  
…  

And the dream exhales you gently back into your bed—awake, but with a new kind of knowing blooming in your chest. The compass, when you check your pocket, is still there—quiet, steady, pointing home.

Would you like to know where that home *is*? 🌙
