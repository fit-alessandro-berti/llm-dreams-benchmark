**Dream Continuation:**  

The wind howls like a chorus of lost souls, and the waves rise like towering obsidian walls, crashing against the hull with a force that rattles your bones. The ship groans under the strain, its timbers protesting the ocean’s fury. Lightning splits the sky, illuminating the faces of your crew—wide-eyed, drenched, but still trusting in your command.  

You grip the wheel, knuckles white, and bellow over the storm:  

**"Reef the sails! Batten down the hatches! Steady as she goes!"**  

The crew scrambles to obey, their fear momentarily eclipsed by purpose. The ship lurches violently, but you hold course, navigating by instinct and the faint glimmer of a lighthouse in the distance—or is it just a trick of the storm?  

Then, through the chaos, you hear it—a deep, resonant hum beneath the waves. The water churns unnaturally, and something vast and shadowy moves beneath the ship. The crew freezes. The storm, the waves, even time itself seems to hold its breath.  

A choice looms:  
- **Do you steer toward the lighthouse, racing against the leviathan beneath?**  
- **Or do you ready the cannons, preparing to face the unknown?**  

The dream teeters on the edge of your decision. What do you do?  

*(Your turn—how does the dream end?)*
