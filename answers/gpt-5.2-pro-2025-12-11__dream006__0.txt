…begin to speak—and your voice comes out as a thin ribbon of air, like you’re trying to whistle through a straw. You clear your throat, lean into the microphone, and the microphone leans back, as if it doesn’t want to hear it either.

A ripple passes through the audience. Thousands of faces blur into one moving surface, like a field of wheat turning in wind. You glance down at your notes.

They aren’t notes anymore.

They’re a folded paper boat, damp around the edges, and written across its side in your own handwriting is: **“You already know what to say.”**

The stage lights warm your skin too much, as if they’re getting closer. The podium begins to soften under your hands. The wood turns to something like clay, then to bread, and your fingers leave prints in it. Somewhere in the front row, a person coughs—politely, patiently—and the sound echoes like it’s happening in a hallway you’ve been in before.

You try again.

This time your voice arrives, but not from your mouth. It comes from the ceiling speakers in a calm, practiced tone, saying words you don’t remember thinking: “Thank you for being here. I’m here to talk about the thing we keep stepping around.”

On the huge screen behind you, a slideshow starts on its own. Instead of bullet points, it shows doors: a red door, a narrow door, a door half-open in the dark. Each time you hesitate, one of the doors clicks shut with a firm, final sound.

You feel something in your pocket.

You pull it out and it’s a key—old brass, heavy, warm like it’s been held recently. Etched into it, in tiny letters, is your name. Not your full name—just the name you had when you were very young, before anyone corrected you.

The crowd is watching. But it isn’t the kind of watching you feared. It’s quiet, steady, like they’re waiting for *you* to arrive.

Your hands move before you decide. You step away from the podium and cross the stage to the screen, which now looks less like a screen and more like a wall. One door remains open in the image, a pale rectangle of light.

You press the key to it.

The key turns with a soft metallic click you feel in your teeth, and the door swings outward, not on the screen but in the air itself, opening into a corridor lit by morning. The smell of rain comes through first. Then a sound: birds, distant traffic, a kettle beginning to hum.

The audience exhales together, and suddenly you understand what they want—not performance, not perfection, just honesty, just contact. You look back at them, and for the first time you can make out individual faces: someone who looks like your teacher, someone who looks like your friend, someone who looks like you but older, nodding once as if to say, *Yes. That.*

You take a breath and speak, without the microphone.

Your voice is your own now—imperfect, steady, real.

“I’ve been afraid,” you say. “But I’m here.”

The lights dim as if to make space. The open doorway brightens. The stage behind you becomes less important than the possibility in front of you. You feel the whole room lean forward—not hungry, not judging, just present.

You take one step toward the door.

And just as your foot crosses the threshold, the applause begins—not loud, but like rain starting on leaves.

Then the dream shifts, the corridor stretches, and you wake with the sensation of the key still warm in your hand.
