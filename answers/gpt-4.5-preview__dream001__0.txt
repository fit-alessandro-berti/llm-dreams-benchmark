walk briskly down the bustling street, searching for clues in faces and windows, hoping something will spark your memory. The city is unfamiliar yet strangely captivating—buildings rise high, wavering gently as if animated by your thoughts. You catch fragments of conversations that remind you vaguely of your destination, but they fade before clarity forms.

Checking your watch, anxiety rises as the hour draws nearer. You approach a nearby vendor selling luminous fruits you've never seen before. Politely you ask directions, but the vendor simply smiles mysteriously, handing you a radiant, golden fruit and pointing upwards to a spiraling staircase you hadn't noticed moments before.

You follow the staircase, climbing skyward, stepping upward through layers of mist that gently swirl with color and sound. At the top, you see a large, ornate door floating gently and invitingly in midair. Hesitantly, yet expecting answers, you pull the door open.

To your surprise, the familiar scene of your meeting greets you warmly, filled with friendly faces clearly waiting for your arrival. As you step inside with relief, the door softly closes behind you, dissolving into the gentle hum of bustling conversation. You sit down calmly, noticing comfortably that your notes and all necessary papers wait neatly before you, perfectly prepared. You relax, satisfied and curious, ready to discover the purpose behind this strange yet inviting gathering, as your surroundings shift softly into new, inspiring images.
