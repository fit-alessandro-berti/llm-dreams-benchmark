completely written in a language you don’t understand—an intricate script swirling with unfamiliar symbols and shapes. Panic starts to rise in your chest, but then the classroom begins to change around you. The walls melt away into a vast, star-lit sky, and the exam paper transforms into a glowing, shifting puzzle.

Suddenly, you realize the test isn’t about facts or formulas, but about creativity and intuition. You begin to move your hands over the puzzle, rearranging the glowing pieces. Each time you connect a piece, a wave of understanding floods your mind, images and ideas flowing freely. You smile as the pieces fall into place, revealing not a single answer, but a new path—a dream career you never expected, filled with endless possibilities and joy.
