You wake up with a start, heart pounding as though you’ve been chased through the night by phantom shapes. Sitting up, your hands meet the rough weave of a linen sheet instead of the soft cotton you’re used to. The scent of the air, too, is different—unfamiliar woodsmoke drifts through a nearby open window, and the daylight that pours in feels weak and filtered, as though you’re in a place without electric lights brightening the edges.

You’re in a small chamber, its walls made of plaster and rough-hewn timber, with a single wooden stool beside a low table. There’s a bowl with a crust of porridge inside it, and a wooden spoon that looks as though it’s been hand-carved. Though the bed beneath you is rough, some attempt at comfort—an embroidered blanket, lovingly stitched—has been made. Outside, you hear shouts and calls, but no engines, no hum of electricity. There is no phone buzzing. No faint radio static. Just the distant clank of metal on metal, and the sound of human voices drifting through the narrow streets.

Standing, you realize your attire is odd: a simple tunic and trousers, tied at the waist with a hemp cord. Your feet are bare against uneven floorboards. There’s no closet of familiar clothes. No shoes that fit your old life. As you approach the window and peer outside, you see thatched rooftops, dirt paths, and a cluster of market stalls where merchants barter and haggle. The language they speak is reminiscent of old tongues you’ve only read about in history books. Your heart sinks a bit, knowing you understand only fragments. But if you listen carefully, you catch words for bread, for apples, for wool. You realize that you’re far from home and likely far from your own time.

A cool breeze wafts in, smelling of damp earth and hay. You must figure out how to survive here. You need to find food that isn’t someone else’s leftover porridge, learn how to communicate so that you can navigate your new surroundings, and find shelter more permanent than this borrowed bed. Somehow, you must blend in without drawing suspicion: no one here seems to know you, and if they discover you’re from another era, it might end badly.

You examine your surroundings again, more carefully this time. Along the wall is a small chest, unlatched and filled with a few folded garments, a piece of flint and steel, and a worn leather pouch that rattles slightly. Inside the pouch, you find a few dull copper coins, irregular in shape and stamped with symbols you can’t quite decipher—an emblem of a crown, a pair of crossed swords, a strangely rendered stag. They look valuable enough, but you have no idea what they’ll buy you.

Down below, you hear a voice calling out something that sounds like a name. Is it calling for you? You’re not sure, but the urgency in the tone is clear. Perhaps the occupant of this room is expected to be out and about by now. If you stay here too long, suspicion might arise.

You slip the pouch of coins into your pocket and make your way through a low wooden door into a hallway lit by a single, flickering candle. The floor creaks beneath you as you descend a set of stairs that leads into what looks like a communal area—a small tavern, maybe? A few people in rough-spun garments stand around a large oak table, breaking bread and dipping it into bowls of steaming stew. They greet one another with nods and brief words, their accents thick with the cadence of a distant past.

In that moment, you realize you need to establish your place here quickly. Without modern technology—no phone to translate, no digital map to tell you where you are—you’ll have to rely on observation, intuition, and basic human trust. As you approach one of the patrons at the table, a middle-aged woman with kind eyes and a worried expression, you lift your hand in a gesture you hope is universal: peace, greeting, curiosity. You try a careful smile and offer what might be a greeting word, borrowed from the bits of conversation you overheard outside. Her eyes sharpen with curiosity, and she nods slowly, as though trying to place you.

You realize that you need to learn their language—and fast. Without words, bartering will be difficult, finding work impossible. Perhaps the answer lies at the market you glimpsed earlier. Where there is trade, there is often the learning of new tongues. Where there are strangers arriving, there might be someone who knows more than one language. A traveler, a merchant from afar. You could introduce yourself to the world as a wanderer from distant lands, in search of work. With patience, you can pick up their words and customs. With time, perhaps, you might thrive here.

Stepping outside, you squint against the morning sun. You must find a place where people gather, where you can listen, observe, and emulate their speech. You must find food and shelter, or arrange to earn your keep. You must prove yourself trustworthy, or at least harmless, to these people who might otherwise regard you as an outsider—or worse, a threat.

Your pulse quickens, a mix of fear and excitement swirling in your chest. This world, though primitive compared to the one you knew, is rich with possibilities. You have no technology, no guide but your own instincts. Now, as you step onto the dusty street and take your first uncertain steps into this distant era, you know what you need to do: survive, adapt, and become a part of this new world—or find some way, however distant the hope, to return home.
