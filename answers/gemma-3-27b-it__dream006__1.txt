You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to… feel a strange lightness in your feet. Not nervousness, not fear, but a genuine buoyancy. It’s like the stage is made of clouds. 

I open my mouth to speak, but instead of words, a cascade of butterflies erupts. Not *from* my mouth, exactly, but *around* me. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of iridescent butterflies, each a different shade of blue and purple, swirling and dancing in the spotlight. 

The audience doesn’t gasp, doesn’t murmur. They *laugh*. A warm, joyful sound that washes over me. And then, they start to release their own butterflies. From their pockets, from behind their ears, even seemingly conjured from thin air. The auditorium transforms into a living, breathing kaleidoscope of wings.

I realize, with a startling clarity, that this isn’t a speech about *what* to say, but *how* to feel. It’s not about delivering information, but about releasing something beautiful and fragile into the world. 

I raise my hands, not to quiet the crowd, but to conduct the swirling mass of butterflies. As I move, the butterflies respond, forming shapes – a soaring bird, a blooming flower, a single, enormous heart. 

A little girl in the front row points at the heart and whispers something to her mother. The mother smiles, tears glistening in her eyes. 

Suddenly, I understand. The speech wasn’t meant to be *heard*. It was meant to be *felt*. It was meant to be a shared experience of wonder and release. 

And as the butterflies continue to dance, I feel a profound sense of peace. I don’t need words. The butterflies are saying everything I need to say. They are saying, “Let go. Be free. Be beautiful.”

Then, a single, enormous monarch butterfly lands gently on my nose. And I wake up, with the faint scent of wildflowers and the lingering feeling of wings brushing against my skin.
