interlocking grooves that make your fingers itch. They spiral and knot into shapes that look familiar in a way you can't name—like the outlines of constellations you used to trace on ceiling cracks as a child, or like a script in a language you never learned but somehow understand.

The more you stare, the more the patterns move. Lines that were carved solid into the wood are now fluid, flowing like ink. When you tilt the box to the light, they seem to catch the glow and release it again, breathing. You run a finger along one of the loops and a soft warmth pulses under your skin, spreading up your arm. Somewhere deep inside the box, something hums, as if responding to your touch.

There is still no key.

You flip the box over. Underneath, one of the spirals completes itself into a labyrinth. You find your fingertip has started tracing it without you telling it to, slowly following the path to the center. As you trace, images flare up around you: a kite stuck in a tree, the smell of rain on summer asphalt, the sound of your mother's laughter echoing through an empty house. Each memory sticks to the groove of the labyrinth like dew.

When you reach the center, the box clicks. Not an opening, but a shift, as if the lock just turned inside you. You lift the lid, expecting resistance, but it rises almost weightlessly, as if it had been waiting for this moment for centuries.

Inside, there is…light. Not blinding, but deep, golden, like the sun through closed eyelids. It pours over your hands and fills the room, and for a breath you can see everything it touches in perfect detail: the dust motes turning into fireflies, the wallpaper blooming with impossible flowers, the ceiling dissolving into a night sky thick with stars.

At the very bottom of the box, nestled in the light, is a small mirror. You pick it up, and it shows you not your face, but the back of the box, the patterns etched there—and behind them, the faint outline of another box, inside another set of hands. You feel a current, a loop, all the boxes inside boxes, all the dreams inside dreams, all of them opening when you remember the path.

You lean closer to the mirror and your reflection leans back, smiling like someone who has known the secret all along. You realize, with a jolt that is half laughter and half sob, that the key was never missing. It was your fingertips, your memory, your willingness to trace the path.

The hum becomes a melody, the patterns on the box sway to it, and you feel yourself becoming as light as the light pouring out. You climb into the box because it is bigger than the room now, bigger than your own body. The lid closes gently above you, and it feels less like being shut in and more like being held.

In that warm darkness, you hear a voice that might be your own whisper, "We are home," and as you reach to open the box again from the inside, you wake up with your hand still tracing circles on the sheet. An imprint, faint but there, of the labyrinth glows on your palm for just a moment before it fades with the morning light.
