You start to sprint down a glittering, glass-tiled avenue that keeps folding into itself, like an M. C. Escher staircase made of neon reflections. Every store window shows a different calendar—one says 3:27 p.m., the next 11:59 p.m., another flashes “already missed.” A low chime vibrates from deep inside the sidewalk grids; with each bell toll the street signs switch fonts. Your throat tastes of melted watch hands.

Suddenly an articulated bus painted midnight-blue stops right beside you. Its doors hiss open and the driver is you, wearing the exact same clothes but twenty years older, balder, eyes tired. Your older self nods at an empty seat directly behind him. You climb in. There are no other passengers—only the quiet rustle of folded meeting agendas sliding back and forth on the chrome rails.

The bus lurches forward; outside, the city liquefies into black sand that pours upward, forming shifting skyscrapers that spell out floating three-letter acronyms. One of them—QTZ—glows emerald. You feel it tug between your ribs like a magnetized memory. You whisper the letters and the bus instantly tilts 90 degrees and drives vertically up the glass side of the QTZ tower. Gravity becomes a suggestion; loose change orbits your head like copper planets.

Halfway up, the older-you driver stands, hands you a blank business card. When you take it, it blooms with ink: Meet me on the 47th floor rooftop garden, now. The card’s edges soften into living ivy, wrapping your wrist like a living bracelet. The driver then steps through the windshield as if it’s water, dissolving into city-lights on the other side.

The bus parks itself against emptiness; the door opens onto a spiral staircase grown entirely from brass fingernails. You take the stairs three at a time; each step rings with a different human laugh. As you climb, the ivy bracelet tugs, guiding your turns so you never hesitate, even when a staircase forks into twelve directions.

You arrive at the rooftop garden. Wind smells of rain that hasn’t decided whether to exist yet. In the center, under a single artificial moon, stands a conference table carved out of ice. Nine empty chairs: one already melting. A holographic clock—unattached to anything—hovers above, hands racing. 59 minutes gone, exactly one left.

You sit in the melting chair. It hardens. Across from you, the empty seats begin to fill with versions of you—child, teen, yesterday-you, tomorrow-you—each carrying a blue folder stamped URGENT. They open them simultaneously; the sound is a flock of paper wings. Every folder is blank except for a single typed sentence: You are the meeting.

The moon dims. You hear distant chimes again. You blink, and every you folds together like mirrored shutters until only you remain. The table is now water, the garden gone. You stand on the lip of a rooftop that overlooks a city assembling itself from your own pulse. Somewhere in that sparkling lattice, your real destination is booting up, made of whatever you decide the next second should be.

You take the ivy bracelet off your wrist. It straightens into a silver pen. The skyscraper at your feet tilts, offering its edge as a page. You sign your name.
