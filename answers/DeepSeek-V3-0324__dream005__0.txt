As you weave through the crowded room, the hum of laughter and conversation surrounds you like a thick fog. The faces blur together—strangers sipping drinks, exchanging pleasantries, their voices rising and falling in waves.  

You catch glimpses of your friend—a familiar laugh, the flash of their coat—but each time you move closer, they slip away, swallowed by the shifting crowd.  

Then, you turn a corner and find yourself in a quieter space—a dimly lit hallway lined with old paintings. At the far end, a door stands slightly ajar, golden light spilling onto the floor.  

A voice—your friend’s?—whispers your name from beyond the door.  

Do you step forward? Or do you turn back to the party, where the noise feels safer, even if it’s full of strangers?  

(What happens next is up to you—dreams are fluid, after all.)
