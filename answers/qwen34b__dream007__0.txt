You’re in a small, dimly lit coffee shop, the air heavy with the smell of stale espresso and the hum of distant conversations. Your friend, **Mason**, sits across from you, his face flushed, hands clenched around a cup that’s been steaming hot enough to leave faint circles on his palms. The argument has escalated to the point where the barista, who’s been quietly observing, finally looks up and says, *“You two better not be arguing over the weather.”*  

The topic? **Your brother’s job**. He’s a recent grad, and he’s been working at a soul-crushing internship in a corporate office, while you’ve been chasing your dream of opening a small, independent bookstore. You’ve been pushing him to pursue his passion, but he’s been clinging to the “secure” route, telling you that “stability” is the only thing that matters. Now, he’s yelling, *“You don’t understand—this is a *career*! You think I can just… *what?* Just pick up a pen and write a book?!”*  

You lean forward, voice trembling but urgent: *“You don’t have to do it *my* way, Mason. But you can’t just wait for someone else to tell you what to do. You’ve got a mind, you’ve got a life—*you* choose what you want.”*  

He slams his cup down, the noise echoing in the quiet space. *“You don’t know what it’s like to *work* for a living. You think it’s just *fun*? You think I can just… *leave*?!”* His voice cracks, and for a moment, you both stare at each other, the weight of the argument pressing between you like a physical force.  

Then, the barista steps in, her voice soft but steady: *“You two need to talk. Not here. Not now.”* She hesitates, then adds, *“The storm’s coming.”*  

You both look up—and the sky outside the window is a swirling mass of dark clouds, lightning crackling overhead. The coffee shop’s lights flicker, and the air grows colder. You realize it’s not just the argument that’s changing; it’s the *world*. The coffee cups vanish, the barista disappears, and the shop becomes a void of shadow and light.  

Mason’s voice breaks through the chaos: *“I… I don’t want to lose you, you know. I don’t want you to… you know, *leave* me.”*  

You feel a lump in your throat, the words unspooling in your mind. *“I don’t want to lose you either,”* you say, your voice shaking. *“But I can’t watch you do this… this… *empty* thing.”*  

The storm swells, and the space around you begins to dissolve. You’re drawn into a dreamwhere the coffee shop is replaced by a vast, open plain—*your brother’s childhood home*, but with the windows shattered and the walls glowing with the light of a thousand stars.  

Mason steps into the light, his face softening. *“What if I… what if I do both? What if I do the internship, but I save money, and then… I go back to school? I’ll do it your way.”*  

You look at him, and for the first time, you see the fire in his eyes—not just the anger, but the *hope*.  

The storm clears, and the stars above you whisper: *“Choose your path. But don’t forget where you came from.”*  

You both laugh, tear-eyed, the weight of the argument lifting like smoke in the morning sun.

**Note**: The dream dissolves into a blur of light and shadow, leaving you with the sense that the argument was never just about a job—it was about love, fear, and the delicate balance between chasing dreams and holding on to the people you love.
