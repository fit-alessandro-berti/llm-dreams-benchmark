...and the air grows thick, like walking through water. The conversations aren't in words anymore, but in colors that float from their lips like smoke—blue for laughter, sharp red for gossip, a dull grey for boredom. You try to push through, but the groups shift like tide pools, closing gaps before you can slip past.

Every time you catch a glimpse of the person you know, they are further away, standing on a balcony that shouldn't exist in this venue. You climb a staircase that spirals like a corkscrew, and with every step, the noise below fades into a rhythmic humming, like a giant engine purring beneath the floorboards.

When you finally reach the balcony, the person is facing away from you, looking out at a cityscape that is actually a reflection of the room you just left. They turn around, but they don't have a face—just a smooth, mirrored surface. In the reflection of their head, you see yourself, but you aren't wearing your clothes; you are wearing the night sky, dotted with stars.

"You're late," the mirror-face says, but the voice comes from inside your own chest. "The party was never for them. It was for you."

The floor beneath you dissolves into soft sand. The music stops. You realize you aren't looking for them anymore; you are waiting for the sun to rise so you can wake up.
