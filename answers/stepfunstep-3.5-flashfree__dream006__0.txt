You begin to speak, but instead of words, a flock of origami birds unfolds from your mouth. They flutter into the air, each one a different color, swirling around the auditorium like a living kaleidoscope. The audience gasps, not in disappointment, but in awe. One by one, the birds land gently on their heads and shoulders. As they touch each person, they whisper a single, forgotten memory—a feeling of first love, a scent from childhood, a half-remembered melody. The crowd is silent, tears streaming down many faces, transformed by the shared, wordless truth. You step back from the microphone, your throat finally quiet. The stage is empty, but the birds continue to circle, weaving a tapestry of silent understanding above the heads of the crowd. Your speech, it seems, was never meant to be heard. It was meant to be *felt*.
