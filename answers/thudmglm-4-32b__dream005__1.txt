Okay, I'm dreaming... this feels so real...

...奇怪的四周環境混入了熟悉的朋友，想讓人歡聲笑語，卻又感到有些不屑。我周圍的人不以為意，卻百度卻在自己的方圓，這種感受就像坐立不安。

...encounter various groups of people and **find yourself drawn to a pair standing by a bookshelf, deep in conversation about arcane history. They gesture wildly towards an imaginary map, their excitement infectious despite your inability to fully join the discussion. You linger nearby, observing, feeling a strange mix of curiosity and your own isolation sharpening**.

**The air shifts suddenly, growing thick and heavy, smelling faintly of damp earth. Before you can react, several large, luminous bubbles drift down from the high ceiling, gently glowing in pastel colors. They float just above head height, and people seem unsure how to react – some point, some shy away, others tentatively reach out**.

**One bubble drifts directly towards you. It's warmer than the others. For a moment, an overwhelming sense of peace washes over you, dissolving the awkwardness. You realize the bubble is reflecting the faces of people you love, memories playing like a silent movie on its surface. You instinctively touch it, and instead of popping, a cascade of tiny, shimmering leaf-like confetti rains down around you, followed by a low, resonant hum that seems to come from everywhere at once**.

**As the bubble vanishes, leaving only the confetti whispering to the floor, the room around you subtly changes again. The walls seem to ripple, the sounds of conversation soften, and the air fills with a low, pleasant humming noise, like a thousand bees in the distance. You feel lighter somehow, and the image of the bookshelf conversation fades**.

**Now, the only clear thought is that you don't just need to *find* the one person you know, but you need to ask them something urgent – about the disappearance of a certain type of sweet, edible substance that wasn't there a moment ago, but feels incredibly significant. You scan the crowd again, desperately searching, feeling the pull of the next, unknown, strange shift just on the horizon...**
