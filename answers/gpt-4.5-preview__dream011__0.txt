written in a strange, unfamiliar language you have never seen before. Everyone around you calmly begins writing their answers, seemingly unaffected, while the instructor moves quietly about the room, handing out additional pages and nodding confidently in approval. A quiet panic builds within you, and you frantically wave your hand trying to signal the instructor.

As the instructor approaches, they lean down slowly and whisper, "You already know the answers. Just trust yourself." Confused but hopeful, you stare again at the alien-like symbols, and gradually they shift, rearranging slowly into images and scenes from your memories. Each question transforms into episodes from your life—moments of triumph, lessons learned, and crucial decisions once faced.

Suddenly, clarity comes over you. You realize this is not an ordinary exam; it's an evaluation of your life experiences, your intuition, your deeper wisdom. You start writing your answers confidently, your earlier anxiety dissolving as meaning pours effortlessly onto the pages. Time slows down, and a reassuring warmth settles in your chest, allowing you to confidently complete question after question, each seemingly guiding you toward your true path.

As you finish, you place your pen down calmly. You notice the instructor smiling warmly from across the room. You intuitively know you passed—not just an exam, but a crucial test of trust in yourself and your life's journey.
