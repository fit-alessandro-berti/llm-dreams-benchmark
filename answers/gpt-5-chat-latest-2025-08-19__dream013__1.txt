…notice that the puzzles aren’t random at all. Each one feels eerily tailored to you—riddles phrased in the voices of people you once knew, symbols that remind you of places you’ve been, choices that echo problems you’ve faced before.  

As you solve them, the corridors start to subtly change. At first, the walls are stone, cold and gray. But with each step forward, flashes of color and light begin to seep between the cracks, like the maze itself is alive and responding to your progress.  

The puzzles grow harder, pressing you to think in ways you never have—patterns within patterns, choices that force you to weigh not just reason, but intuition and emotion too. Some puzzles dissolve if you stop overthinking, others only yield when you’ve pushed your logic to its sharpest edge.  

Eventually, you realize something startling: the maze is mapping your mind. Every turn reflects a decision you’ve made in waking life, every door you open forces you to confront pieces of yourself you might have forgotten—or avoided.  

The deeper you go, the quieter it becomes. Until, at the very center of the maze, there is no puzzle at all. Just a mirror, standing still in a faint glow, waiting for you to look into it.  

Do you want me to continue the dream and describe what happens when you face the mirror?
