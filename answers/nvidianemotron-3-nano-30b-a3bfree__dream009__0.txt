You wake up not to the hum of your alarm or the cold kiss of morning air, but to the *smell*—woodsmoke, damp earth, and the faint, sweet rot of apples from a nearby orchard. Your skin is cool against rough, hand-spun linen sheets. You’re lying on a hard, narrow pallet in a small, dim room with walls of rough-hewn wood, not plaster. A single, small window lets in pale, dusty light, and beyond it, you see *horses*. Not carriages, not cars—*horses*, tethered to a hitching post, their breath pluming in the chill air.  

You try to sit up, but your muscles ache with a stiffness that feels alien. You look down at your hands—pale, but calloused, the nails short and practical. You’re wearing a coarse, homespun tunic, not your usual cotton pajamas. *This isn’t a dream*, you think, *this is a trap*. You stumble outside, your bare feet sinking into cool, packed earth.  

The village is *different*. No glass windows, no signs of metal. Buildings are timber-framed, with thatched roofs slanting against the sky. People move slowly, carrying buckets of water or bundles of firewood. Their clothes are dark, woolens, and their faces are lined with weather and work. A woman in a faded blue dress glances at you with wary curiosity, her eyes wide at your strange, clean clothes and your *voice*. You open your mouth to speak—*“What year is it? Where am I?”*—but the words choke in your throat.  

The dialect is *wrong*. Not just old-fashioned, but *unfamiliar*. The words sound like they’re from a different tongue entirely. You try again, louder: *“Excuse me? Do you have a phone? A car?”* The woman just stares, then shakes her head slowly, her eyes flicking to the other villagers gathered nearby. They’re whispering, pointing. One man steps forward, his face granite, and says something sharp in a language you don’t know.  

**You realize you need to *learn their language*.**  
Not just to survive, but to *exist* here. To be understood. To not be a ghost in their world. The realization hits like a physical blow: *You don’t speak their words. You don’t understand their world. And without that, you’re just… a mistake.*  

The silence stretches. The villagers watch you, not with anger, but with a quiet, ancient suspicion. You take a breath, forcing your voice to sound calm, to *fit*. You point to your own mouth, then to the sky, then to the ground. *“Language,”* you try to say, enunciating each syllable as if it’s a new song. *“Need to learn… language.”*  

The woman’s eyes soften just a fraction. She nods once, sharply, and gestures toward the edge of the village, where a cluster of cottages huddle near a river. *“Follow,”* she says—not in English, but in a word that sounds like *“Tal-ar.”*  

You step forward, your heart hammering against your ribs. The dream isn’t just a dream anymore. It’s a door. And you have to *walk through it*, word by word, to find your way out.  

*You need to learn their language.*  
*Or you’ll be lost here forever.*  

*(The dream fades as you take your first step toward the river, the sound of your own voice—so foreign, so fragile—echoing in your ears.)*
