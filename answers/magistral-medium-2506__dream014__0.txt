accept their kindness with gratitude. As they guide you through winding streets, you notice something strange—the city seems to shift and change around you. Buildings warp into unfamiliar shapes, and the sky darkens into twilight, though it was just daytime moments ago.

One of the strangers—a woman with silver hair and knowing eyes—smiles and says, *"Sometimes, being lost is the only way to find what you’re really looking for."* The group leads you to a hidden courtyard, where a single door stands at the center, glowing faintly. When you reach for the handle, the strangers vanish, leaving you with a choice: do you open the door, or turn back to the ever-shifting streets?

What happens next is up to you.
