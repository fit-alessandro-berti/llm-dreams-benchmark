**Dream Continuation:**  

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find shelter before nightfall**. The air smells of damp earth and burning wood, and the distant sound of hooves on cobblestone suggests a village isn’t far.  

You spot a narrow dirt path winding through tall grass, leading toward a cluster of thatched-roof cottages. The villagers eye you warily—your strange clothing and bewildered expression mark you as an outsider. A weathered old woman steps forward, her gnarled hands clutching a basket of herbs.  

*"Lost, are ye?"* she rasps. *"The forest is no place for wanderers after dark. Come, share a meal, and tell me where you hail from."*  

As you follow her, you wonder: **Is this the past, a parallel world, or just a dream?** And more urgently—**how will you survive here?**  

*(Would you like to shape the next part of the dream? Maybe uncover hidden dangers, learn forgotten skills, or search for a way back?)*
