…take a deep breath before you say anything else. In the fluorescent light of the café you’ve both been sitting in, your friend’s face wavers for a moment, as if reflected in water.

“I don’t think we’re really hearing each other,” you say, and the hum of other conversations around you fades away. You suggest going for a walk, just to get some air, to cool down. The two of you push through the door and step out, and in that way that only happens in dreams, the street outside isn’t the street you came in on. It’s a wide, empty beach at twilight, the tide sighing in and out.

You look over and your friend is staring at the horizon instead of at you, their shoulders no longer tense. You realize that whatever you were arguing about – the job offer in another country, the betrayal you felt, the way everything seemed to be changing – doesn’t feel as sharp here. You decide to sit down in the sand. Your friend sits beside you.

“I’m scared,” you admit, and the words dissolve into the sound of the waves. “Me too,” they say, and when you turn, their eyes are full of tears and stars.

The argument shifts into something else, softer. You talk until your voices blend with the surf and the sky turns a color you don’t have a name for. When you reach out, their hand is there, warm and solid. The important thing, you realize even in the dream, isn’t winning but not losing each other.
