You start to run, your shoes slapping against the cobblestones as you dart through winding alleys and across bustling squares. The city shifts around you—buildings twist like melting wax, street signs flicker between languages you don’t recognize, and the faster you move, the more the horizon stretches away. You fumble for your phone, but the screen swims with static, the map app dissolving into pixelated nonsense.  

A stranger hands you a compass, but the needle spins wildly, pointing at your own reflection in a shop window. Then you hear it—a faint, familiar melody drifting from nowhere. You follow it, breathless, until you spot a flickering neon arrow above a door, pulsing in time with your heartbeat.  

Inside, the room is empty except for a clock ticking backward and a single chair. As you sit, the walls fall away, revealing a starlit sky. A voice, gentle and boundless, whispers, *"You were never late. You were here all along."*  

The meeting, it turns out, was with yourself.
