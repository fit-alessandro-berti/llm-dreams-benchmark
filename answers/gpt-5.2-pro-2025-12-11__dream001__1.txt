You start to run, then slow to a purposeful walk, because in dreams haste feels like swimming through honey. The streets rearrange themselves as you look away—alleys becoming boulevards, storefronts trading places like cards in a magician’s hand. Every sign is almost readable, as if the city is shy about being understood.

You stop a passerby to ask for directions. The person turns, and their face is a blurred reflection of your own, as if you’re seeing yourself on a fogged mirror. They answer without moving their mouth: *“You already know. You’re just trying to remember it in the wrong order.”* They point up.

Above you, the sky is not sky but a ceiling of pale stone, arched like a cathedral, threaded with hairline cracks that glow faintly. A train runs across it—impossibly overhead—its windows lit with warm, domestic light. You hear the soft clatter of dishes inside, the murmur of conversation, the sound of someone laughing at something you almost recall.

You follow the sound instead of the streets.

A staircase appears where a wall should be, steep and narrow, carpeted in a pattern you recognize from somewhere you can’t place. Each step you take makes a different time of day happen: dawn, noon, dusk, midnight, then back again. At one landing there’s a small table with a telephone, the old kind with a cord. It’s ringing.

You pick it up. A calm voice says, “You’re late.”

“I don’t know where I’m going,” you say, and the panic returns like a cold hand at the base of your neck.

“You’re going to the room where you always end up,” the voice replies. “Stop trying to find it like an address. Find it like a feeling.”

The line clicks dead. The receiver becomes heavy in your hand, then suddenly it’s a book. The book opens by itself to a page that is blank except for a single sentence written in careful ink: *Ask the first door that looks like it’s been waiting for you.*

You look up.

A corridor stretches ahead, long enough to be impossible. Doors line both sides—some ornate, some plain, some painted impossible colors. You walk past doors labeled with things you’ve forgotten: **FIRST APOLOGY**, **PLAN B**, **THE NAME YOU ALMOST SAID**, **TUESDAY THAT NEVER HAPPENED**. The air smells like rain on hot pavement.

Halfway down, you see it: a door that is not labeled at all, just slightly ajar, light spilling out as though it’s been breathing.

You push it open.

Inside is a meeting room that looks wrong in a familiar way. The table is too long, the chairs too small, the walls hung with framed maps of places that don’t exist. At the far end, a large clock ticks loudly, its hands spinning with indecisive urgency, pausing, racing, pausing again. A projector hums, casting a pale rectangle onto the wall, waiting for a slide that never arrives.

Around the table sit several people. They are dressed differently—one in a winter coat, one in a suit, one in clothes you wore years ago—but they all have the same attentive posture, as if listening for something important to begin. Their faces are clearer than the city’s, but not entirely stable. They look like you, and they do not.

An empty chair waits near the head of the table. A nameplate rests in front of it, turned facedown.

As you walk toward it, everyone’s eyes follow you, not with judgment, but with a quiet patience that is worse than judgment, because it suggests you’ve been expected for a long time. The clock’s ticking becomes louder, then quieter, like it’s adjusting to your heartbeat.

You sit. The chair fits you perfectly, as if it’s been shaped by your weight.

You turn the nameplate over.

It reads: **YOU (TODAY)**.

A folder lies in front of you. Your hands open it on their own. Inside is an agenda written in your handwriting, except it’s steadier, more decisive.

1. What you have been avoiding.  
2. What you actually want.  
3. What you will do when you wake up.

Someone across from you clears their throat. A person who might be you at sixteen leans forward and says, “Start with the second one.”

Your mouth goes dry. You try to speak, but instead of words, a memory rises—small and bright: the feeling of walking into a room and not shrinking, of saying a simple truth without apologizing for taking up air. The memory has no image attached, only certainty.

The person in the winter coat taps a pen against the table. “We don’t need a perfect plan,” they say. “We need an honest one.”

The person in the suit slides a sheet of paper toward you. It’s a map—not of the city, but of your week. The streets are labeled with emotions instead of names: **DREAD**, **RELIEF**, **BUSY**, **WAITING**, **ALMOST**, **NOT YET**. A red circle is drawn around a single point: **ONE CONVERSATION**.

You look up. “With who?” you ask.

All of them answer at once, in overlapping voices that assemble into a single sentence:

“With the person you keep calling later.”

The clock stops.

For the first time since you arrived in the city, there is silence—real silence, not the kind padded by distant traffic. It feels like a door closing gently somewhere behind your ribs.

You take the pen. You write something on the paper. You don’t see the words as you write them, but you feel them—clean and plain and slightly terrifying. When you finish, the ink dries instantly, and the room exhales as if it had been holding its breath.

The projector flickers. An image appears on the wall: not a presentation slide, but a doorway in your own home, familiar down to the scuff on the baseboard. Beyond it is morning light.

The one who might be you at sixteen smiles, almost mischievous. “That’s the exit,” they say. “You can pretend you didn’t come here, if you want. But you’ll still know where the door is.”

Your chair pushes back by itself. The meeting room seems to tilt, gently, like a ship changing course. The maps on the walls ripple as though they’re made of water. The corridor outside elongates into brightness.

As you step toward the projected doorway, you glance back at the table. The others are already fading, not vanishing exactly, but returning to wherever they belong inside you. The nameplate flips facedown again.

You cross the threshold.

The city collapses behind you like a paper model folded neatly away.

You wake with your heart steady and the strange, stubborn certainty that you *do* know where the meeting is—because it was never in the city at all.

It’s in the hour ahead.
