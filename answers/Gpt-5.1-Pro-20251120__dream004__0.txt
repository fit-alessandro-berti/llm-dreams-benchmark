…and the blankness feels louder than all the swirling color around you.

It’s a simple rectangle of white, standing upright in the middle of the chaos, held by an easel that doesn’t seem to touch the ground. The world around it ripples—triangles melt into circles, circles stretch into long ribbons of light—but the canvas stays still, waiting.

You step closer.

There’s a brush in your hand that you don’t remember picking up. Its bristles are already stained with every color you’ve ever seen and a few you somehow *remember* without ever having known. When you raise your hand toward the canvas, the landscape behind you leans in, like it’s curious.

You touch the brush to the white.

Instead of paint, a *memory* appears.

At first it’s small: a faint sketch of a window from a childhood room. The light in the memory is soft and warm, and as you keep the brush there, color slowly fills it in. You can smell dust and summer air. The sound of someone laughing in the distance drifts out of the canvas, as though the painting is also a door.

You pull the brush back, startled. The image stays.

You try again—this time, you think of nothing at all, and simply drag the brush in a long line across the canvas. The stroke bends and curls on its own, forming a path that winds into the painted distance. Tiny houses appear along it, shifting quickly through styles and eras: a cottage, an apartment, a small, messy room with a desk and a glowing screen. Every place you’ve ever lived, layered into a single road.

The brush feels lighter now.

You realize you aren’t choosing what to paint. You’re *remembering*, and the canvas is doing the rest.

You test a thought: fear.
A dark shape appears at the top corner of the canvas. It isn’t a monster, or anything you recognize—just a heavy, jagged shadow that hums with unease. It leans over the painted path like a storm cloud with teeth. The colors of the landscape around you dim in sympathy.

You don’t like that.

So you try another thought: comfort.

The shadow cracks slightly. Light leaks out from inside, soft and golden. A small figure steps into the painting—also you, but younger, or maybe older, or maybe just *braver*. This version of you walks up to the shadow, reaches out, and calmly takes its hand. The shadow shrinks, folding into a smaller, round shape that now looks less like fear and more like a loyal dog made of night.

The world around the easel brightens again.

You keep painting.

You sweep the brush in a loose arc and think of the people you’ve known. Faces flicker briefly along the edge of the canvas like constellations: some clear, some blurred, some only felt as color and warmth. They don’t stay long; they drift upward, becoming little stars that hang in the painted sky.

You notice something strange: every time you paint a new memory or feeling, a corresponding change happens in the landscape behind you.

When you paint water, you hear waves at your back. Turning, you see a sea has appeared in the distance, every wave edged in neon and shadow. When you paint a door, an actual doorway rises from the ground beside you, framed by shifting shapes, leading… somewhere.

The canvas and the world are not separate. They’re mirrors, or maybe they’re the same thing.

You pause, brush hovering over white space. There’s still a large, empty patch left.

For the first time, you wonder: *What if I paint something that hasn’t happened yet?*

You think of a feeling you don’t have words for: a quiet certainty, like standing at the edge of a decision you’re finally ready to make. You imagine yourself stepping through a door, not knowing what’s on the other side—but going anyway.

You put that feeling into the brush and touch it to the canvas.

An image forms: you, older than you are now, sitting at a table lit by a soft, honest light. There are papers, or maybe drawings, or maybe small pieces of a life you chose instead of drifted into. Your face in the painting looks tired, but peaceful. There’s someone sitting across from you, their features blurry but kind, mid-laugh. Outside the painted window, the world looks ordinary, which somehow makes it glow.

The landscape around you shivers.

The floating shapes slow down, as if thinking. Colors fold into calmer shades. The distant sea smooths out. One by one, doors appear in the air all around you, each outlined with a gentle halo of possibility.

The painted you on the canvas looks up—directly at you.
Their eyes are clear. They smile, small but real, and then raise a hand, mirroring yours.

You realize your brush has disappeared.

All that’s left is your open palm and the nearest door, its surface gently rippling with shifting color. On its surface, for a moment, you see the blank canvas again—only this time, it’s inside the door, waiting for another version of you to find it.

You understand, suddenly: this dream isn’t about escaping into some unreal world. It’s about remembering that even awake, you’re holding a brush you keep forgetting is there.

The door in front of you swings inwards, just a crack.

Light spills out—not blinding, not dramatic. Just… possible.

You take a breath you don’t remember starting.

And you step forward.
