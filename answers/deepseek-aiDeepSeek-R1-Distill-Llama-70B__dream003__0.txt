The next riddle inside the box continues the celestial theme and presents a poetic challenge. Here it is:

---

"In the darkness, I am bright,  
Though I reflect, I do not emit light.  
I am full, then I fade,  
My phases mark time, though I am not made.  
I pull on the earth, yet I am weightless,  
A silent guardian of the night's stillness.  
What am I?"

---

**Answer:** The Moon

Upon solving this riddle, another hidden compartment opens, revealing a small key and a note that reads: "The journey through the stars continues. Seek the one who guides the way in the darkest night." This sets the stage for the next adventure.
