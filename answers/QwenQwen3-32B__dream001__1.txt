You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to run, but the streets seem to stretch and twist as if alive, forcing you into a labyrinth of towering glass spires that reflect not the sky, but fragmented memories—your childhood bedroom, a stormy beach, a door you’ve never opened. A crowd of faceless figures in tailored suits murmurs around you, holding hourglasses that tick backward. When you ask for directions, they only smile and shrug, their voices echoing like chimes in a windless room.  

You duck into a café with no name, hoping to catch your breath. The barista, a fox with human hands, serves you a coffee that tastes like melted clocks. “The meeting?” they say, licking their paw. “It’s wherever you learn to stop running.” Before you can ask what they mean, the floor dissolves into a river of liquid mercury, carrying you toward a bridge guarded by a giant, grinning cat who asks, “What’s the one thing you’ve forgotten?”  

Panic surges. You glance at your watch—ten minutes left. The cat yawns, “Answers cost a memory.” You hesitate, then hand over the recollection of your first laugh. The bridge solidifies, and the cat points to a skyscraper shaped like an hourglass, its apex bleeding light. You sprint upward, elevator buttons labeled with emotions: *Hope*, *Regret*, *Nowhere*. You punch *Hope*.  

The elevator ascends through clouds of static, and when the doors open, you’re standing in a conference room made of starlight. The attendees? Versions of yourself—older, younger, versions with different choices etched into their skin. The chairperson, a you with feathers for hair, says, “You’re late. The meeting was never about time. It was about arriving.”  

The room dissolves. You wake—still running—but this time, you’re not lost.
