As you step onto the stage, the lights dim slightly, casting a golden glow over the crowd—a sea of faces, some familiar, some strangers, all holding their breath. The air hums with anticipation, thick with the weight of unspoken words. You take a deep breath, your fingers brushing the edge of the notes in your hand (or perhaps you’ve forgotten them entirely—this is a dream, after all).

Then—something shifts.

The first line you intended to say *doesn’t come out*. Instead, your voice takes on a strange, resonant quality, like water rippling over smooth stones. The words that spill from you are *not yours*—they’re old, poetic, layered with meaning you didn’t know you carried. The crowd leans in. A child in the front row gasps. A man in the back stands, wiping his eyes.

You realize: *This isn’t your speech. It’s a story.*

The words weave through time—fragmented memories of a lost love, a forgotten place, the way the ocean remembers every wave it’s ever held. The audience doesn’t just listen; they *feel* it, their bodies swaying slightly, their hands reaching for one another. A woman in a red coat begins to cry, but her tears are joyful, like rain on parched earth.

Then—you see *them*. Figures standing just beyond the stage’s edge, half-hidden in shadow. They don’t move, but their presence is *alive*—like the hum of a string instrument plucked just out of tune. One of them tilts their head, and for a heartbeat, you recognize them: it’s the version of *you* from five years ago, standing in this very spot, trembling. They smile, and the memory dissolves into smoke.

The speech ends not with a bow, but with silence. The crowd stands, slow and deliberate, as if waking from a dream. One person—maybe the child, maybe the man in the back—steps forward and presses a single, perfect pebble into your palm. It’s warm. When you open your hand, the pebble is gone, but your fingers are etched with constellations.

You wake up—breathless, sunlight streaming through your curtains—and realize: *You were never supposed to give the speech. You were supposed to be the story.*
