…run.

You start to run, not because the pavement demands it but because the city seems to be folding time into narrow alleys. Skyscrapers lean in like eavesdropping giants; neon characters flare and recombine into words that almost make sense. People pass by with faces like photographs flickering—some smiling, some blank—and none of them look at you long enough to ask a question. Your watch ticks sideways and then melts into a puddle of silver on the curb. Your pockets are full of things that shouldn't be there: a brass key, a dried autumn leaf, a ticket stamped with an impossible date.

You ask for directions and the answers come in metaphors. A woman at a fruit stall hands you an orange and points toward a plaza where pigeons trace constellations. A child in a blue hat tugs at your sleeve and whispers, “Follow the shadows that are going the other way.” A billboard blinks into view: MEETING 17:00 — ENTRY THROUGH THE LITTLE DOOR. You look for a little door and find instead a seam in the wall, like a zipper forgotten by the city. When you unzip it, sunlight pours out in quadrants.

Inside the seam the streets tilt, gravity softens, and the city rearranges like a deck of cards. Buildings slide into alleys, lampposts unfurl into paper cranes, and your shoes remember how to float. Time compresses—an hour becomes a corridor. As you move, fragments of memory drift by: a classroom chalkboard, a kiss under rain, the first time you learned to ride a bike. Each memory hangs like a lamp you could take, and somewhere behind them you hear laughter that sounds like your own.

You follow the sound to a room that is both huge and impossibly small. A long table stretches into fog; chairs are set for people who are not here yet. At the head of the table sits a figure you have always known and never met—the you that chose differently at some earlier fork: softer, sterner, younger, older, or simply other. Papers lie before them with titles like “Regrets,” “Possibilities,” “Instructions for Tomorrow.” They look up with kind impatience and raise a hand to beckon you.

The meeting, it turns out, is not about schedules or contracts but decisions. You sit and the city quiets to the hum of a single clock. Questions arrive like envelopes: What will you carry forward? What must you leave at the door? How do you want to be remembered in alleys you have not walked yet? You find you can open the envelopes. One contains a map that folds itself into a paper boat and floats away; another contains a list with only one item: Begin.

You speak, and your voice is both very small and enormous. You realize that every detour you took—the wrong turn that became a short cut, the stranger who handed you a key, the puddle you almost stepped in—was an answer. The meeting dissolves into conversation and then into a quiet agreement: you will keep moving, not because time presses you, but because you have chosen the path you want to practice walking.

When you leave the room, the city is less a maze and more a choir of possible streets. The little door reseals behind you; the puddle on the curb gleams like a watch. You glance at it, and for a moment the hands point exactly to the hour you need. Whether you make it on time is a detail that matters—and yet, as you step into the crowd with the map folded into your pocket, you understand that the only important meeting was the one where you learned how to find yourself in a city that rearranges at will.

You wake—or you think you wake—and for a long slow second the smell of citrus and rain and warm metal lingers on your skin.
