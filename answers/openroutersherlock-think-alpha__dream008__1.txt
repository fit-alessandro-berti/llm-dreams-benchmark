You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you freeze, staring at the blank screen as the clock ticks backward from zero. Your keyboard morphs into a writhing nest of glowing worms, typing gibberish poetry about forgotten taxes. "Get to it!" your boss bellows, but his face melts into a giant cartoon clock, hands spinning like helicopter blades.

You dive in anyway, fingers flying—except now you're not typing code, you're painting the Mona Lisa with spaghetti noodles that keep snapping back into uncooked clumps. Coworkers sprout wings and flutter around, dropping coffee mugs that shatter into fireworks spelling "OVERTIME FOREVER." The deadline looms as a black hole sucking in desks, and you're tumbling toward it, project file ballooning into a hot air balloon made of TPS reports.

Just as the vortex pulls you in, your alarm blares—a flock of digital pigeons explodes from your monitor, and you jolt awake in sweat-soaked sheets, heart pounding. The dream fades, but your laptop hums ominously on the nightstand... waiting.
