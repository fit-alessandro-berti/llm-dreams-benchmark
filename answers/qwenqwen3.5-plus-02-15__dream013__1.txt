...as you move deeper into the maze, you notice the walls begin to breathe. The stone isn't cold anymore; it pulses with a warm, rhythmic heat, like the chest of a sleeping giant.

The puzzles shift, too. What started as rigid equations and sliding tiles now transforms into riddles written in shifting constellations on the ceiling. You realize that logic alone won't unlock the path forward; you have to *feel* the answer. When you stop trying to force a solution and instead let your mind drift, the gears of the mechanism click into place with a sound like wind chimes.

Suddenly, the corridor widens into a vast, circular chamber. In the center stands a mirror, but it doesn't reflect your face. Instead, it shows a version of yourself standing in a sunlit field, holding a key made of light. As you reach out to touch the glass, the maze dissolves into mist. The intense concentration fades, replaced by a profound sense of clarity. You aren't lost anymore; you were never lost. The maze was just a way to quiet the noise of the world so you could hear your own intuition.

You take the key from the reflection, and as your fingers close around it, you wake up, the feeling of the cool metal still lingering in your palm.
