You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel the weight of the moment pressing down like a ceiling about to crush you. The project? To design a fully functional app that can predict the future—specifically, the exact time you’ll wake up from this dream. The deadline? In *three minutes*.  

Your boss, a towering figure in a suit that seems to shimmer with the glow of a thousand screens, leans over your desk, eyes sharp as a laser. “This isn’t a joke,” they say, voice low and urgent. “The client wants results, and they want them *now*.” They vanish before you can respond, leaving you alone in the office, which suddenly feels *too quiet*.  

You glance at your computer, but the screen is blank. The clock on the wall ticks backward. You try to think, but your thoughts dissolve like smoke. Then, the office *shifts*. Walls melt into a kaleidoscope of colors, chairs float, and the floor becomes a mirror reflecting your face—but it’s not your face. It’s someone else’s: a version of you, older, wiser, with eyes that glow like stars. They whisper, *“You don’t need to predict the future. You need to stop dreaming.”*  

You snap back to reality, heart racing. The clock is now at *one minute*. You grab your laptop, fingers flying, but the software is gone. Instead, a new window opens: a blank canvas. You realize the only way to “finish” the project is to *stop* working. You take a deep breath, close your eyes, and let your mind drift…  

When you open them again, the office is gone. You’re back in your bed, the alarm blaring. But your hand is clutching a glowing orb—the same one from the dream—pulsing with the same rhythm as your heartbeat. You wonder if the dream was a warning, a test, or just your brain’s way of saying, *“You’ve been working too hard.”*  

The orb fades, and you fall asleep, wondering if the deadline was ever real—or if you’d always had the power to escape it.
