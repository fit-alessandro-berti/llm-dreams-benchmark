You quicken your pace, the air thick with the scent of ozone and damp earth. Thunder rumbles in the distance, and the trees begin to sway violently, their leaves tearing free and spiraling upward like emerald confetti. A crack of lightning splits the sky, illuminating a path you hadn’t noticed before—a narrow trail lined with strangely luminous mushrooms glowing faintly blue. Compelled by instinct, you follow it.  

The forest grows darker, but the mushrooms pulse brighter, their light reflecting off the rain that now falls in heavy, silvery sheets. The storm feels alive, as if it’s breathing around you. Ahead, the path opens into a clearing where an ancient stone circle stands, moss-covered monoliths humming with a low, resonant energy. In the center, a figure cloaked in swirling mist raises a hand toward the sky.  

Lightning strikes the ground beside you, and instead of fear, you feel a surge of electricity coursing through your veins. The figure turns—their eyes flickering like storm clouds, hair alive with wind—and beckons. As you step into the circle, the rain transforms. Each droplet becomes a tiny prism, refracting light into impossible colors. The figure whispers words you don’t understand, and the storm suddenly pulls inward, collapsing into a single point of light that spirals into your chest.  

You gasp—your body weightless, glowing—and realize you’re rising, the forest shrinking below. The storm is now inside you, a tempest of calm and chaos intertwined. The figure smiles, dissolves into a flock of starlings, and you soar with them above the clouds, the world below a patchwork of shadow and shimmering green.  

When you wake, the memory lingers like the echo of thunder. Your hands still hum. On your bedside table, a single luminous mushroom glows faintly in the dawn light.
