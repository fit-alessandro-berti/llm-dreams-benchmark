You wake up in a sun-drew valley nestled between towering cliffs and surrounded by wild forests, your eyes adjusted to the glow of bioluminescent fungi. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **build a temporary shelter using only natural materials found in the environment to protect yourself from the elements**. The earth beneath you feels rough underfoot, and the air smells of damp moss and distant storms. Gritting your nails, you gather stones, branches, and moss, molding them into a conical structure that could deter wind and insects yet withstand nighttime colder than any human hand could manage.
