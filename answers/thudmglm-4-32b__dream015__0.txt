... to find a way to preserve a small part of what came before. Wandering through the silent, crumbling ruins of a city – the sky a perpetual, hazy grey – you come across the library that once stood near the old university. Its roof is gone, but the thick stone walls still mostly stand, offering a fragile shelter.

Inside, dust swirls in the weak light filtering through broken windows. Most of the shelves are empty, collapsed, or charred. But amongst the devastation, you begin to find them:attered books, pages brittle, covers falling apart. You carefully gather them, the weight of knowledge and past worlds heavy in your hands.

Scavenging for water purification materials and any tools or salvage you might need, you set to work creating a small, hidden repository. In a more intact basement section, accessible only through a heavily barricaded opening, you begin constructing shelves from salvaged wood and metal. You line them with scraps of fabric, anything to deter the pervasive dust and damp.

It's slow, painstaking work. You face dangers – mutated creatures skittering in the shadows, rival scavenger groups, dwindling supplies. But fueled by the belief that these words, these stories, contain more than just ink on paper, you press on. You're not just collecting paper; you're trying to keep a single, fragile flame of human culture and memory alive in the dark. You decide to become a keeper of secrets from a world gone by, hoping that perhaps, somehow, this small act of preservation might matter.
