start to scan the skyline, your pulse quickening. Towering structures of impossible geometry twist upwards like crystallized smoke, reflecting a sky that’s both sunset-pink and pre-dawn blue. The air hums with an energy that’s not quite sound, a low thrumming vibration that makes your teeth buzz. Pedestrians flow past in silent rushing rivers, their faces blank as porcelain masks, ignoring your growing panic.

You frantically pat your pockets – no phone, no wallet, no map. Just the worn fabric of your coat and the unsettling awareness that this city feels… *alive*. The architecture seems to shift subtly when you look away, cobblestones rearranging themselves into unfamiliar patterns. The signposts are indecipherable glyphs that shimmer and dissolve under your gaze.

An hour. You need to *find* the place. But where? What does it even look like?

You try to retrace your steps, but every turn leads to a new plaza or canyon of mirrors and glass that reflects distorted versions of yourself. You see a flicker movement down an alley – a figure in a long coat, impossibly tall, waiting. When you approach, the alley is empty. A gargoyle on a nearby ledge seems to watch you with knowing eyes.

Suddenly, a brass pocket watchmaterializes in your hand. It’s old, ornate, and ticking backwards. The hands spin wildly, settling on... 10:58 AM? But the sky outside suggests otherwise. The thrumming energy intensifies.

You realize the city itself might be giving you clues. The *kind* of disorientation, the way the light falls... it feels specific. Not lost, but *misplaced*. Perhaps the meeting isn't in a traditional building? Something about the energy... it feels connected to the humming, the impossible structures, the silent flow of people.

You stop fighting the disorientation. Instead, you close your eyes, focusing on the thrumming energy. It feels like a current. You open your eyes and let instinct guide you, walking *with* the flow of the silent crowd, towards a district where the buildings seem more organic, like grown coral or giant, dormant machines. The thrumming leads you there.

You push through a crowd near a plaza dominated by a colossal, fractured sundial made of obsidian. As you step towards it, the obelisk-like structures lining the plaza begin to emit soft, pulsing light, coalescing into a shimmering outline high in the air – a rotating symbol that feels ancient and deeply significant. This *must* be the signal. Your meeting point.

You break into a run, the dream logic of the city allowing you to move with impossible speed through the thrumming streets. The symbol hovers directly above a doorway set into the base of the fractured sundial. It pulses rhythmically, in time with your own frantic heartbeat.

You reach the entrance – a sleek, seamless archway of dark metal. As you approach, the archway glows warmly and dissolves into mist, revealing a room bathed in soft, non-directional light. Inside, a single figure sits at a simple obsidian table, waiting. No anxiety, just calm expectation. The pocket watch in your hand clicks audibly, the hands flipping to exactly 11:00 AM.

The figure looks up, their eyes holding a depth that mirrors the fractured sky outside. "You're late," they say, their voice a resonant echo of the city's own hum. "But you found the way." You realize you weren't just lost; you were navigating the city's dream-logic, and it had been waiting. Now, the real meeting could begin.
