In your dream, the kindness of the strangers feels like a breath of fresh air—warm, unexpected, and grounding. As you step forward, their voices blend into a soft, harmonious murmur, guiding you through the chaos of the city’s neon glow and distant chatter. One of them, a woman with eyes like polished river stones, extends a hand and says:

*"You don’t have to figure this out alone. The city is vast, but we’re here to show you the way—just for a little while."*

The group leads you down a winding alley where the air smells of rain-soaked pavement and distant spices. Their paths weave together like threads of a tapestry, each person offering a piece of themselves: a map drawn on a napkin with a smile, a pocket watch that ticks backward when you hold it, a key that fits no lock you’ve ever seen. One man, his sleeves rolled up to reveal ink-stained arms, presses a small, glowing seed into your palm. *"Plant it where you feel most lost,"* he murmurs. *"It grows toward light."*

As you follow, the city’s skyline shifts—buildings stretch taller, then dissolve into something softer, like clouds shaped by hands. The strangers begin to fade, their forms dissolving into the crowd, but their voices linger: *"You were never lost. You were just waiting for the right path."*

Then—you wake up, the seed still warm in your hand, and for the first time, you realize you’re not alone in the quiet of your room. The city’s hum is just a memory, but the kindness stays. You get up, step outside, and the world feels a little brighter.

Would you like to explore another layer of the dream? Maybe the seed’s meaning, or what happens when you plant it? Or perhaps the city itself has secrets to reveal?
