...to follow the faint, persistent signal on your scavenged radio. It crackles with a weak, looping message: "Sanctuary... coordinates... still green..."

The voice is staticky, but it holds a note of hope you haven't heard in years. Your water is low, your boots are falling apart, and the horizon is a permanent shade of dust-brown. But this signal speaks of *green*.

You shoulder your pack, its weight familiar and punishing. The journey will take you through the skeletal remains of the old city, a labyrinth of crumbling concrete and hidden threats. You know the rules: move quietly, trust nothing, conserve everything.

As you pick your way through a canyon of shattered office towers, a glint catches your eye—a single, resilient dandelion pushing through a crack in the asphalt. You pause, a strange tightness in your chest. You haven't seen a flower in a decade. Carefully, you don't pick it. You simply note its location, a tiny waypoint on your mental map.

The dream shifts, as dreams do. Suddenly, you're not just walking; you're being watched. You feel the prickle on your neck, the silence that is *too* silent. From the shadow of a burnt-out bus, a pair of eyes gleams. Not the feral glow of a mutated beast, but the calculating, desperate stare of another survivor. They are gaunt, armed with a sharpened pipe, mirroring your own wary posture.

You have a choice. A tense standoff in the grey dust. Do you raise your own weapon, a scavenged piece of rebar wrapped in leather? Do you run, risking an attack from behind? Or do you do the unthinkable in this world—you slowly reach into your pack, pull out your last can of beans, and place it on the ground between you. You take two steps back, your hands open.

The stranger stares, unblinking. Then, with a movement almost too fast to follow, they snatch the can and melt back into the shadows. You exhale, your heart hammering. A foolish risk. But as you turn to continue, you see it—scratched into the rust of a nearby car door, a fresh arrow pointing west, the direction of the signal. And beneath it, a crude drawing of a leaf.

They weren't just a threat. They were a pilgrim, too.

The dream solidifies around this new purpose. The signal is not a place, but a path. And you are not alone on it. You adjust your pack, your step a fraction lighter, and follow the arrow into the deepening twilight, the static of the radio now mixing with a new sound in your mind—the faint, echoing rhythm of another set of footsteps, somewhere ahead in the ruins, leading you on.
