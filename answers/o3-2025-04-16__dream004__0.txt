…and something—some presence—places a shining brush in your palm. The handle is warm, pulsing like a tiny heartbeat, and every bristle glows with all the hues that swirl through the sky around you. The blank canvas towers above you one moment, then shrinks to postcard size the next; it floats weightless, waiting.

You lift the brush.

At the first touch, pigment flows out as living light. Where you think of crimson, a flock of ruby‑feathered birds bursts forth, spiraling into the distance. A thought of ocean blue melts into a rolling tide that spills off the edge of the canvas and pools at your feet, cool and salty, only to evaporate into drifting sapphires that chime like glass windbells.

You begin to paint your own path: a winding ribbon of silver that unspools into the horizon. The ribbon solidifies into a road, and when you step onto it, the canvas stretches beneath your feet, becoming the very ground you stand on. With each stroke you add—mountains, moonlit lilies, constellations like jeweled gears—the world rearranges to honor the image.

Soon you realize the canvas is no longer in front of you; it is you. Your skin carries constellations, your shadow sprouts wings when you imagine flight, and every breath releases motes of gold that drift upward to seed new galaxies. You feel an exhilaration that is both creation and discovery, as if you are remembering something you’ve always known.

But then the colors around you slow, thickening like honey. The brush in your hand dims, its heartbeat easing. Ahead, on the horizon of your newly painted world, you see another blank space—vast, inviting, silent. Instinct tells you it’s time to pass the brush forward.

You set it down upon a pedestal of violet mist, step back, and watch as the bristles flare one last time, waiting for the next dreamer to arrive.

And just before everything dissolves into dawn, you hear your own voice—echoing from everywhere and nowhere—whisper: “Wake remembering you can still paint.”
