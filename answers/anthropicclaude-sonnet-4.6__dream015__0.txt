# The Garden at the End of Everything

...plant something.

It seems almost absurd, kneeling in the cracked grey earth with a single seed cupped in your palm — something you found wrapped in wax paper inside a rusted tin, tucked beneath the floorboards of what used to be a library. The paper label read *Morning Glory* in faded ink, and you don't even know if seeds keep that long, if they survive whatever changed the air, whatever leached the color from the sky.

But you dig a small hole anyway.

The ground resists at first. It's been compressed by years of silence, hardened into something that almost resembles stone. You use your fingers, then a bent spoon you carry for exactly nothing in particular, and the earth slowly yields — dark and unexpectedly *alive* underneath the grey crust. You catch the smell of it and something in your chest unlocks without warning.

You press the seed in.

You cover it.

Nearby, a crow watches from the skeleton of a telephone pole. You've seen it three days in a row now. You've started leaving things for it — a button, a piece of mirror, small bright offerings. Today you leave a fragment of red glass. The crow tilts its head with the solemnity of a professor considering a thesis.

"I know," you tell it. "Probably won't grow."

The crow says nothing, which you choose to interpret as encouragement.

---

You build a small ring of stones around the planting site. Not for any practical reason — rain is rare but occasionally violent, and stones won't stop that. You build the ring because it transforms a patch of dirt into a *place*. Because your hands need something to do that isn't survival. Because there is a difference, you've decided, between being alive and *living*, and that difference might be exactly this: the utterly impractical act of making something matter.

You find yourself returning every morning.

You bring water in a cracked ceramic mug — rationing carefully, always — and you pour a small measure at the base of the stones. Some mornings there is almost no water to spare and you pour it anyway, which troubles you in the night and feels completely right in the morning light.

On the ninth day you see the first thread of green.

---

It is the most beautiful thing you have seen since everything ended.

It is the most beautiful thing, you think, that you have ever seen *at all* — this single pale filament, this comma of life pushing up through impossibility. You sit beside it for a long time. You don't touch it. You're afraid to breathe too close.

The crow lands on a stone at the ring's edge.

"Look," you say to it, pointing unnecessarily.

The crow looks. You are both very quiet for a while.

Word gets around, the way things do when communities are small and people are hungry for anything other than fear. A woman named Sable arrives one afternoon with her daughter, a girl of about seven who has never, you realize, seen a garden. The girl crouches down and studies the tendril with enormous eyes.

"What will it be?" the girl asks.

"Morning glory," you say. "Flowers. Blue and purple ones, I think."

The girl considers this. "Can you eat them?"

"Not really."

She looks at you with the evaluating gaze of a very old soul. "Then why?"

You open your mouth. You have fourteen practical answers and none of them are true. So you tell her the true one.

"Because pretty things make the other things survivable," you say. "Because if everything left is only useful, then what exactly are we surviving *for*?"

The girl looks back at the plant. Her mother puts a hand on her shoulder.

"We have seeds," Sable says quietly. "From before. We thought — we weren't sure they were worth carrying." She pauses. "We're sure now."

---

By the end of the month there are eleven gardens.

They are ridiculous, all of them. Too small, poorly defended, arguably wasteful of water and effort and hope. They contain things that cannot be eaten: wildflowers from a packet found in a gift shop, a rose cutting propagated through four careful generations of cuttings, herbs that smell extraordinary and do almost nothing.

They also contain things that *can* be eaten — because Sable's seeds include tomatoes and squash and a bean variety that grows fast and fierce — but the point is that nobody separated the categories. The useful and the beautiful went into the ground together, intertwined, because the people planting them had decided, collectively and without a meeting or a vote, that they were the same category now.

That they had always been.

---

You dream sometimes — dreams within the dream — of the world before. Of its overwhelming abundance, all that light and noise and careless plenty. You remember taking things for granted the way you breathe: automatically, without thought.

You wake from those dreams without bitterness, which surprises you.

Because here is the strange gift that the ending gave you: *attention*. Everything costs something now, so everything is noticed. The seed. The green thread. The color blue when the morning glories finally open — and they *do* open, on a grey Tuesday when the sky is the color of old tin and the air smells faintly of rain — the color is so blue, so *aggressively*, defiantly blue, that three people nearby stop walking and just *stand there*.

Someone starts crying.

No one is embarrassed about this.

---

The crow, you notice, has brought a friend.

You leave two pieces of mirror, two red buttons, two fragments of colored glass. The crows inspect your offerings with professional interest.

"We're going to be alright," you tell them. 

You don't know if it's true. Probably it's not true in any large or permanent sense. There are still the dangers, the scarcity, the nights that are too cold and the silences that are too loud and the absences where people used to be.

But the morning glories are open.

And the girl — whose name, you've learned, is Wren — comes every morning now, before anything else, before breakfast or chores or checking the perimeter. She comes to count the blooms. She keeps a small notebook with a tally.

You asked her once what she was going to do with the data.

She looked at you as if you'd missed something obvious.

"Remember," she said.

---

You are still dreaming.

The dream doesn't resolve into triumph or safety or any guaranteed tomorrow. The world stays broken. The sky stays the color of old tin most mornings. The work is constant and the grief is constant and there are nights when hope feels like a con you're running on yourself.

But every morning there are the gardens.

And in the gardens, winding up through whatever salvaged wire and bent rebar and broken chair legs you've arranged for it to climb, the morning glory grows with a kind of furious, joyful insistence —

as if it never got the message

that this was not a world for growing things.

As if it simply *decided* otherwise.

You watch it in the early light, this dreaming sleeper, this tender insurgency of blue —

and you understand, in the way you only understand things in dreams:

*This* is how it starts again.

Not with a plan.

Not with a weapon.

With a seed.

With someone foolish enough

to believe it was worth the water.

*The dream continues. You let it.*
