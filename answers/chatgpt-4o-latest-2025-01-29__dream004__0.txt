pick up a brush that materializes in your hand. The moment the bristles touch the canvas, swirling colors spill out, forming shifting patterns that pulse with life. The canvas extends, stretching beyond its borders, and suddenly, you're no longer painting—you are stepping into the scene itself.   

The sky above turns a deep indigo, speckled with floating, glowing symbols that rearrange themselves like living constellations. The ground beneath your feet is soft, as though made of woven clouds. You hear a distant laughter, and turning around, you see a figure composed entirely of flickering light.  

The figure gestures toward you, its shimmering hand leaving trails of color in the air. "This is your dream," it says, voice like a melody. "But the canvas is endless. What will you create next?"  

You take a deep breath, realizing that with every thought, shapes emerge and dissolve around you. If you imagine a door, where might it lead? If you reach for the sky, can you paint a new one?  

The brush is still in your hand—what do you paint next?
