...plant a garden.

Not just any garden—a ridiculous act of hope in the ash-choked concrete ruins where even rainwater tastes of rust and grief. You found the seed packet in a collapsed hardware store, miraculously dry inside a tin lunchbox wedged under a toppled shelf. The illustration showed a smiling sun over tomatoes that looked impossibly red, impossibly whole.

The soil you scrape from cracks in the pavement is gray and lifeless, but you mix it with charcoal from old fires and your own spit, because water is too precious to waste on dirt. You plant five seeds in the hollowed-out shell of a toilet bowl you dragged to the roof of your shelter—a former parking garage where the wind sings through rebar like a broken flute.

Each morning, you stand guard over your absurd garden with a pipe wrench and a determination that feels almost religious. Raiders laugh when they see it, but their laughter is brittle, confused. They've forgotten what it means to make something grow. You whisper to the seeds, telling them about bees that hummed, about the taste of sunlight, about a world that wasn't always waiting for the end.

On the forty-third day, something impossible happens. A green spear pushes through the ash. You stare at it, not breathing, as it unfurls two tiny leaves that are somehow *more* green than anything you've seen in years. The color hurts your eyes. It looks like a lie the world told itself to keep going.

Then you wake up. The seed packet is still clutched in your hand, but it's just a faded piece of paper. The roof is empty. Yet your fingers smell of earth, and when you lick them, they taste of rust and something else—something almost sweet, almost alive.
