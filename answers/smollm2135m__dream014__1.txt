As I lay there, watching them, I feel disoriented by the sheer number of people rushing around. I'm not sure what direction they're pointing or where to turn. My sense of direction has been slipping since waking up with a headache. Suddenly, I catch sight of this group – my family and friends are staring at me in rapt attention, their faces shining with love and concern for the little girl in distress.

I'm taken aback by the warmth of their eyes, the kindness of their smiles and handshake, and how they seem to care about my comfort so deeply. It takes me a moment to get used to this new world. One glance at their faces or the way they're smiling fills me with hope that we might be returning home soon after my trip from the airport.

As the group makes their way towards me, I feel a sense of excitement and trepidation about how many more people will see us in our daily lives. It seems like we're getting increasingly small in a sea of strangers, yet somehow we manage to stay connected, even when we seem so far apart.
