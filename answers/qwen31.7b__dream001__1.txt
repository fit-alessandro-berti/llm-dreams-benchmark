You start to search the city, but the streets are unfamiliar, and you can’t find a direction. The walls seem to shift, and the fog clings to the edges of your vision, distorting your sense of reality. Your heart races as the clock ticks down, and you notice a flickering light at the edge of the crowd—a neon sign that pulses faintly, like a heartbeat. You approach it cautiously, clutching your breath, and as you step closer, the sign reads: **"The Council of Echoes, 127A."** The numbers are unfamiliar, but the name feels familiar, as if it’s been whispered to you in a dream. You follow the path, your instincts guiding you, and soon, the doors of the building loom ahead, their surfaces etched with symbols you recognize from ancient texts. The meeting is here, but the weight of the moment presses down on you—*you’re not sure if it’s a test or a warning*.
