... start to panic, a cold sweat prickling my skin. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat against the rising tide of anxiety. The city, a dizzying labyrinth of towering chrome skyscrapers and neon signs flashing in an alien language, pulsed around me. Faces, a blur of indifferent expressions, rushed past, their hurried footsteps echoing in the narrow canyons between the buildings.
I frantically rummage through my pockets, hoping for a clue, a scrap of paper, anything. My fingers brush against something smooth and cold – a small, silver compass. It doesn't point North, though. The needle spins wildly, finally settling on a direction that feels inexplicably right.
Driven by a desperate hope, I follow the compass's pull, weaving through the crowds, my anxiety a living thing coiling in my stomach. The buildings grow taller, more imposing, their shimmering facades reflecting the overcast sky. The air hums with a low, thrumming energy, a silent symphony of the city's hidden pulse.
Suddenly, I find myself before a towering obsidian structure, its surface polished to a mirror sheen. My reflection stares back, a stranger with wide, haunted eyes. This must be it. But how do I get inside? There are no doors, no windows, just a seamless expanse of black reflecting the city back at itself.
As I reach out to touch the cold, smooth surface, a single, silver line appears, tracing the outline of a doorway. It slides open silently, revealing a blinding white light... and the feeling of falling, falling, falling through an endless void.
The meeting, the city, the compass – it all fades away, replaced by a feeling of weightlessness, a sense of profound... peace. Then, I wake up.
My bedroom is bathed in the soft glow of dawn. My heart still races, the echoes of the dream city clinging to the edges of my awareness. I sit up, taking a deep breath, the familiar comfort of my own space grounding me. It was just a dream, a bizarre, unsettling dream. But the feeling lingers, a whisper of something unknown, something... important, lost in the labyrinthine streets of a city that only exists in my subconscious.
