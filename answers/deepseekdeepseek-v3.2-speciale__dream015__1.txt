You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to search for other survivors, hoping to form a community that can restore some semblance of civilization. As you wander, you come across an old radio tower and manage to send out a signal. To your surprise, you receive a response: a group of survivors not far away invites you to join them. Filled with hope, you set off toward their coordinates. When you arrive, you are greeted warmly, and together you start planning for a better future. The dream fades, leaving you with a sense of optimism.
