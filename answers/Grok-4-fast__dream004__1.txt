a paintbrush that drips with liquid starlight. The brush hovers in mid-air, whispering secrets in a language of swirling vortices—promises of forgotten galaxies and laughter from upside-down trees. You reach for it, and the moment your fingers graze its ethereal bristles, the canvas awakens.

Ripples of emerald fire bloom across the white expanse, morphing into a flock of clockwork birds with feathers of molten glass. They take flight, their wings slicing the air into prisms that refract the sky into a thousand impossible hues: sapphire storms laced with threads of honey-gold, and clouds that taste like cinnamon regrets. One bird perches on your shoulder, its beak etching a map of your unspoken wishes onto your skin—paths that lead to oceans of whispers and mountains carved from echoes.

As you step back, the canvas expands, swallowing the horizon. Shapes twist into familiar strangers: a childhood swing set made of spider silk, swinging between the teeth of a grinning eclipse; a river of forgotten melodies that flows uphill, carrying lanterns shaped like half-remembered faces. You laugh, and the sound shatters into butterflies with wings of shattered mirrors, each flap reflecting alternate versions of yourself—braver, wilder, unburdened.

But then, a gentle tremor pulls at the edges of the dream. The colors soften, bleeding into a twilight hush, and the brush slips from your grasp, dissolving into fireflies that wink goodbye. You feel the pull of waking, the canvas folding like origami into the folds of your mind. As your eyes flutter open to the mundane gray of dawn, a single drop of starlight lingers on your fingertip, a promise that the dream waits, unfinished, for the next time you dare to paint.
