...a blank canvas floating in mid-air, humming softly like a distant melody. Intrigued, I reach out to touch it, and as my fingers brush the smooth, ethereal surface, the canvas ripples like water disturbed by a stone. Suddenly, colors explode from its edges—vibrant swirls of crimson and sapphire that twist into impossible shapes, mirroring the ever-shifting world around me.

The canvas begins to paint itself, guided by my unspoken thoughts. First, it sketches a towering tree with branches that morph into birds, their wings unfurling into rivers of gold. Then, a cityscape emerges, buildings that bend and sway like reeds in the wind, their windows glowing with memories of places I've never been. I laugh—a sound that echoes and multiplies, turning into a chorus of whispers from the landscape itself.

But as the painting grows, so does the dream's intensity. The canvas pulls me in, and I tumble through its frame into a new layer of the surreal realm. Here, the ground is made of forgotten dreams, soft and bouncy underfoot, and the sky rains ideas like shooting stars. I wander on, chasing a fleeting shape that looks suspiciously like my own reflection, wondering if I'll ever wake... or if I even want to.
