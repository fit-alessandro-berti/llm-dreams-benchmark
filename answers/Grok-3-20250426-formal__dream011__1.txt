written in an unfamiliar language, one you’ve never encountered before. The symbols are intricate, almost like a blend of ancient runes and mathematical equations, shifting slightly as you stare at them. Panic begins to set in, but you take a deep breath and glance around the room. Your classmates seem unfazed, scribbling answers with confidence, as if the questions are perfectly clear to them.

You look back at the exam paper, and suddenly, one question begins to morph into legible text: *“What is the purpose of your existence?”* The weight of the question hits you, and you realize this is no ordinary exam. Your pen hovers over the page, but before you can write, the room starts to dissolve. The desks, the walls, and your classmates fade into a soft, golden light.

You find yourself standing in an endless library, shelves towering into the sky, filled with books that hum with a faint energy. A figure appears before you, cloaked in shimmering fabric, their face obscured. They speak in a calm, resonant voice: “The exam is not about answers. It is about the questions you choose to ask.”

The figure gestures to a single book on a nearby table, its cover blank but pulsing with light. You reach for it, and as your fingers touch the cover, you feel a surge of clarity. The dream shifts again, and you’re back in the exam room, but now the questions on the paper are ones you’ve always carried in your heart: *What do you fear most? What do you hope to create? Who do you wish to become?*

With newfound resolve, you begin to write, not with answers, but with questions of your own, each one unlocking a deeper understanding of yourself. The dream fades as you write, leaving you with a sense of purpose and the echo of the figure’s words: *The exam is never finished. Keep asking.*
