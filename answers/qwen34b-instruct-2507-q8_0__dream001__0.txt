Absolutely. Let's dive into the dream and complete it together—step by step, as if the city is unfolding in real time.

You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to **wander**, the streets shifting like liquid underfoot. The sky is a gradient of soft violet and silver, neither day nor night, as if the city breathes slowly, in rhythm with the quiet hum of unseen machinery.

The buildings rise like glass spines, twisting upward in elegant spirals, their surfaces shimmering with shifting patterns—patterns that look like old equations, or maps of forgotten constellations. A single street runs through the center, paved with stones that glow faintly when you step on them. They pulse gently, like a heartbeat. You follow it, drawn not by logic, but by a pull somewhere deep in your chest.

As you walk, you notice the people—mostly silent, dressed in flowing, translucent garments that seem to fold like water. They move with grace, their eyes reflecting the city’s light in shimmering pools. Some pause to touch the walls, as if communicating with the buildings. One woman with silver hair and a feathered scarf offers you a small glass orb. "The meeting," she says, her voice like wind through reeds, "is where the sky meets the ground. It doesn’t exist in maps. Only in stillness."

You pause. "But how do I find it?"

She smiles. "You already are there. You just haven’t noticed the silence."

You turn to follow the pulse of the street, but then you hear a sound—a soft chime, like a bell made from ice. It comes from behind a glass tower shaped like a crown. You turn, and the tower shifts slightly, revealing a staircase made of solidified light that spirals downward into the ground.

When you descend, you find a small round room with four doors, each marked with a symbol: a clock, a tree, a mirror, and a key. You don’t know which one. But your instinct—it comes unbidden—tells you to open the mirror.

You step through.

Inside, it’s not a room. It's a vision of your past—your childhood home, the sound of your mother’s voice, the scent of rain, a photo of your younger self standing on a hill. And then, the vision shifts. The same room, but now it's a present-day office—your meeting. A woman in a white blouse sits across from you, smiling softly. “You came,” she says. “I’ve been waiting for you to remember.”

And then you realize—it wasn’t a meeting with a stranger. It was a meeting with *yourself*. The city was a manifestation of your inner landscape. Your anxiety about the meeting, your confusion, your fear of failure—all of it had been shaping the dream.

You realize you don’t need to go anywhere. You just need to *be*.

When the clock in the room flickers and shows 12:00, you open your eyes—not in your body, but in your mind. And suddenly, you’re back in your room, the alarm clock buzzing softly. You look at the time: 10:45. The meeting is in ten minutes.

You smile.

You didn’t find the meeting. You *remembered it*.

And in that moment, you realize: every dream is a path to something true—something you already carry.

So, you walk to your desk. You take a deep breath. And you begin to write the meeting notes.

Because now, you know where it is.

It’s always inside you.
