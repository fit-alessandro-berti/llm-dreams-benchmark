**walk away.**

The weight of the words still lingers in the air, sharp and unyielding. Your friend’s expression hardens, their voice rising—*Why can’t you just—* But you’re already turning, stepping back, the concrete under your feet cold against your bare soles. The streetlamp flickers overhead, casting long, trembling shadows.

You don’t look back. Not yet.

The night is quiet except for the distant hum of traffic and the occasional rustle of leaves. Your chest aches, but your mind is clearer now, the fog of the argument dissipating like mist under sunlight. You walk, hands shoved into your pockets, until you reach the corner where the street splits—one way home, the other to the park where you used to talk for hours.

You stop.

A memory flits through your thoughts: last summer, sitting on the same bench, laughing about something stupid. The memory feels distant now, like it belongs to someone else.

You take a deep breath, the air crisp with the promise of dawn.

Then, slowly, you turn back toward the park.

Because no matter how much you want to run, the things that matter—*they don’t just disappear.*
