 wind begins to howl, not with sound, but with a deep, resonant *pressure* that vibrates in your bones. The peaceful greens of the forest deepen to an urgent, dark emerald. The first crack of thunder isn’t a sound so much as a fissure opening in the sky itself, a jagged wound of white light.

Rain doesn’t fall. It *explodes* downward in sheets of liquid silver, each drop catching the fractured light and scattering it like shattered glass. The familiar path vanishes, replaced by a chaotic dance of wind and water. You instinctively raise an arm to shield your face, but the rain doesn’t soak you—it passes *through* you, cold and tingling, like diving into a memory.

You run, not from fear, but from a profound, magnetic pull. The storm is a living entity, and it’s calling you deeper into the woods. Branches whip against your sides, but they feel like brushstrokes from a giant, invisible painter. The world is no longer made of solid things, but of rushing *intent*.

You burst into a sudden, impossible clearing. At its center stands a single, ancient oak, its bark glowing with a soft, bioluminescent pulse—a counter-beat to the storm’s chaos. The wind ceases its roaring here, settling into a whisper that forms words in your mind: ***"You have been sleeping. Wake."***

The storm above the clearing begins to fold in on itself. The silver rain reverses, streaming upward in luminous ribbons. The thunder cracks soften into the sound of a great, sighing release. The wound in the sky stitches itself closed with threads of fading gold.

In the sudden, profound silence, the glowing oak’s bark peels back like a curtain. Inside the hollow is not wood, but a perfect, still pool of starlight. And in its reflection, you see not your own face, but the face of the forest itself—vast, ancient, and patiently, lovingly awake.

You understand then. You weren’t walking *through* the forest. You were walking *within* a dream, and the storm was the dream’s way of reminding you how to truly see. The forest breathes, and you, finally, are breathing with it.

You reach out, not to touch the water, but to touch the air between you and the tree. It is cool, and solid, and humming with a quiet, eternal song. The dream is over. The knowing has just begun.
