Here is my attempt to complete the dream scenario:

You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a strange language that you've never seen before. Perplexed, you look around at the other students who all seem to be diligently working on their exams, apparently having no trouble understanding the foreign script.  

Panicking, you raise your hand to get the professor's attention. She approaches your desk and you explain that there must be some mistake - your exam is in a language you can't read. She furrows her brow and tells you this is the exam everyone is taking and you should have studied the material. Your heart races as you flip through the pages, the indecipherable symbols blurring together.

Suddenly, you remember there was an extra credit assignment you never completed that was supposed to give you the key to translate the exam. You rummage franticly through your backpack but can't find the assignment sheet anywhere. You must have lost it! Time is running out as you watch the clock ticking away, the minutes passing faster and faster.

Just as you are about to give up in despair, you wake with a startled jolt. You're in your bedroom, tangled in sweaty sheets. It was only a dream! You breathe a sigh of relief, though the anxiety still feels raw and real. Checking your phone, you see your actual final is still a week away. You vow then and there to thoroughly prepare so the nightmare doesn't become a reality. Determined, you get up to start reviewing...
