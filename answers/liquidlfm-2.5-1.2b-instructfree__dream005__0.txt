The room hums with laughter, the scent of strangers' coffee leaks from clipped cups. I'm weaving through a crowd of unfamiliar faces, my breath hitching as I replay their silhouettes—this one holding a crumpled note, that one hunched over a book, that one with a scar brushing their temple. Every conversation is a puzzle, every glance a potential thread to tug.  

Then, a flicker of movement: a figure at the edge of the crowd, a violin playing softly. They glance up, eyes narrowing as they notice the size of my voice. A splash of color—blood, maybe, or a twisted smile. They step forward, and for a second, the room feels heavier, the air thick with the weight of something unspoken.  

You're not sure if they're curious or afraid. Was it a misstep, a warning? Or did they know you? The notes in their hand tremble slightly as they glance at yours, and a question pricks your mind: *What do they want?*  

But the music swells, and the dance begins. You move toward the edge of the group, the world blurring into a rhythm only you can hear. What are you running from? What are you running toward?  

*(End of dream)* 🌙
