**The Maze of Whispering Shadows**

The air hums with the faintest vibration, like the strings of an invisible harp, as you step deeper into the maze. The walls shift subtly—sometimes smooth and polished like obsidian, other times rough with carvings that seem to writhe when you’re not looking. The path splits again, but this time, the choices aren’t just left or right. Above each fork, a floating rune glows faintly, pulsing in time with your heartbeat.

You reach out to touch one, and the moment your fingers brush the symbol, the maze *breaths*. The walls ripple, and for a split second, you see yourself—not as you are now, but as a child, standing in a sunlit garden, holding a key that doesn’t fit any lock you’ve ever seen. The vision fades, but the key’s weight lingers in your palm (though you know you didn’t actually pick it up).

Ahead, the corridor narrows into a dead end—except the end isn’t a wall. It’s a **door of living mist**, swirling with colors that shift like oil on water. A voice, neither male nor female but *both*, whispers from within:

*"To proceed, you must answer the question that has no answer. Not because it’s unsolvable, but because the answer is the question itself."*

You hesitate. The puzzles so far have been riddles, locks, patterns—but this? This feels like a test of something deeper. The mist door pulses, and you realize: *it’s not asking you to solve it. It’s asking you to recognize that you’re already inside the answer.*

Then—

A shadow detaches from the wall behind you. It’s not a monster. It’s a **version of yourself**, older, weary, holding a lantern that casts no light. It smiles sadly. *"You’re close,"* it says. *"But the maze doesn’t want you to escape. It wants you to remember why you entered in the first place."*

The lantern flickers. The flame isn’t fire—it’s **memory**, and as you watch, it burns away the edges of your own face, revealing the child from your vision. The child holds up the key again, but this time, you see the lock it fits: **your own chest**.

You wake up—

—gasping, sitting bolt upright in bed. Your hands are clenched around something small and cold. You open them.

In your palm is a **tiny brass key**, warm to the touch, humming faintly. And on your nightstand, half-buried under a book, is a **small wooden box**—one you don’t remember owning.

The lid is slightly ajar.

**What do you do next?**
*(Do you open the box? Follow the key’s pull? Or does the dream pull you back in?)*
