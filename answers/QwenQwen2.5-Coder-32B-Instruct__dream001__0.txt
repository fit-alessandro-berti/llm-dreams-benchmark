You start to panic, but you remember a map you saw earlier in your hotel room. You quickly grab your phone and pull it up, searching for the meeting location. To your relief, the address is only a few streets away. You toss your coat on and begin to navigate the bustling city streets, trying to follow the directions on your phone.

Suddenly, you hear a group of people laughing nearby. You turn your head and spot a friend, familiar faces in the crowd. They seem to be having a splendid time, and you feel a mix of emotions—joy to see them, anxiety that you're missing out, and guilt that you're racing to your meeting.

Your friend calls out, waving you over. You hesitate, feeling torn between your obligation and your desire for a moment's respite. You make a quick decision to go to them.

They pull you into the crowd, laughing and joking, and you feel the tension in your body begin to loosen. You talk and catch up, feeling a sense of relief at least having some company.

After a few moments, your friend reminds you of your meeting, and you have to excuse yourself. They offer to see you off, and you head down the street with help, arriving just moments before your meeting starts.

When you reach the location, you step inside, feeling grateful for the chance to connect with an old friend, despite the rush. You push past the butterflies in your stomach and join the others at the meeting, ready to tackle whatever is ahead, with a bit more confidence and a heart full of warmth from your brief encounter.
