the air grows thick with the scent of ozone and damp earth. The once-gentle rustling of leaves turns into a frantic whisper as the wind howls through the branches, bending them like bows. Dark, bruise-colored clouds churn overhead, swallowing the sun whole. A single drop of rain splatters against your cheek—cold, heavy—followed by another, then a torrent.

You break into a run, your heart pounding in time with the thunder that cracks open the sky. The path beneath your feet turns slick with mud, roots snaking up like grasping fingers. Then—*a sound*. Not the storm. Something *else*. A low, rhythmic hum, almost like a chant, vibrating through the trees. You slow, breath ragged, and peer through the downpour.

There, in a clearing where the rain seems to part like a curtain, stands a circle of ancient stones, moss-grown and glowing faintly blue in the storm’s eerie light. At its center, a figure—tall, cloaked in tattered silver—raises their arms. The wind stills. The rain hangs in the air, suspended. And then the figure turns.

Their face is not a face at all, but a shifting void, stars and shadows swirling where features should be. They extend a hand, and in their palm rests a small, pulsating orb of light—warm gold, like captured sunlight. *"You’ve been lost for a long time,"* their voice echoes, not in your ears but in your bones. *"But the storm is just the door. Will you step through?"*

Behind them, the stones begin to *sing*, a harmonic resonance that makes your teeth ache. The orb floats toward you, hovering just out of reach. The forest holds its breath.

Do you take it?
