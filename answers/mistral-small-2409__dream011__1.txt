...written in a language you've never seen before. The characters are strange and swirling, seeming to dance on the page. You try to recall any languages you've studied, but none of them match this. You look around the room, hoping to find someone who can help, but all the other students seem just as confused.

Just as you're about to panic, a small, furry creature with large, wise eyes appears on your desk. It looks like a cross between a cat and a squirrel, with a tiny feathered hat perched on its head. It chitters softly and nudges the exam paper with a tiny paw.

Suddenly, you understand. The language is not one you've ever learned, but it's one you can understand nonetheless. The creature begins to translate the questions for you, one by one. The first question asks, "What is the color of the first leaf you saw fall in autumn?"

You close your eyes and remember the crisp air, the scent of woodsmoke, and the sound of leaves crunching underfoot. You see the leaf, a brilliant red, spiraling down from the tree. You open your eyes and write down "Red" in the language of the exam.

The creature nods approvingly and moves on to the next question. "What is the sound of your favorite childhood song?"

You smile, and the dream continues.
