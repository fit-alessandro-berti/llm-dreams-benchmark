...find the **architect of this stone city before the sun sets.**

The air smells of hot clay and saffron, and the people around you are draped in heavy, woven robes that rustle like dry leaves. You look down at your hands and realize you are holding a scroll made of shimmering, impossible material that feels like water but looks like paper.

You know, with that absolute, unquestioning certainty found only in dreams, that the scroll contains the blueprints for a machine that hasn't been invented yet—and the King's guards are already searching for you. You have to hide the future in the past.
