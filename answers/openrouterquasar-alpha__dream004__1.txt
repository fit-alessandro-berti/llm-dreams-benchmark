you reach out to touch it. The moment your fingers brush the surface, brilliant hues swirl outwards, painting themselves in fluid, living patterns. Mountains rise and dissolve into waterfalls of shifting color; skies ripple like liquid stained glass. You realize that with every thought or feeling, the landscape transforms—I dream joy and flowers bloom in dazzling, impossible shades; I dream fear and shadows ripple across the ground.  

Curious, you focus your mind and imagine a pathway forward. The canvas responds, shaping a luminous bridge of shimmering light. Tentatively, you step onto it, feeling no weight beneath your feet but floating forward nonetheless. Ahead, a doorway materializes, rippling with every color you’ve ever known—and some you haven’t. As you approach, you sense it’s an invitation, a threshold between endless possibilities, waiting for you to dream it into existence.
