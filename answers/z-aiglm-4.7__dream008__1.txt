...scramble to your desk, your heart hammering against your ribs like a trapped bird. You reach for your keyboard to pull up the files, but your fingers feel heavy, swollen—like thick, uncooked sausages. You try to type, but the keys are made of soft, wet sponge, sinking uselessly under your touch without registering a single letter.

Panic rising, you look up at the clock to check the time, but the face of the clock is melting like wax, dripping long, black streaks onto the carpet. The numbers have fallen off completely and are scuttling away across the floor like beetles.

You turn to explain to your boss that you can’t work like this, but when you look at the chair where they were sitting, it’s empty. Instead, a massive, silent grandfather clock is ticking loudly, echoing through the room. *Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock.*

You look back at your computer screen. The document isn't a project brief anymore; it's a mirror reflecting your own face, but your mouth is gone. You try to scream, but instead of sound, a long ribbon of colorful birthday party streamer flows out of your throat. The room begins to spin, the walls turning into liquid, and just as you feel yourself dissolving into the floor, you realize with a jolt of horror that you never actually learned how to read.

Suddenly, the floor drops out from under you, and you are free-falling through an infinite sky of spreadsheet grids, holding a single pencil that is miles long.
