unusual. They don't seem to be about the course material at all. Instead, they are riddles and puzzles. The first question reads:

"I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

What do you do?

1. Try to answer the riddle.
2. Ask the examiner for clarification.
3. Check if anyone else in the room is having the same experience.
4. Decide that this must be a dream and try to wake up.
