In the dream, you frantically begin to work, but your keyboard melts under your fingers, the letters dripping like wax. The clock on the wall spins wildly, hours passing in seconds. Your boss’s voice grows distorted, echoing as if underwater, their face now stretched and blurred. Papers pile up around you, morphing into impossible shapes—trees, birds, flames—each one whispering the deadline in a chorus of urgent sighs.   

Just as panic crests, you notice a door labeled "Escape" flickering in the corner. But when you reach for it, the floor gives way, and you’re falling—not into darkness, but into a calm, endless sky. The weight lifts. And as you drift, the dream shifts again…  

—until you wake, pulse racing, tangled in sheets, the real-world sun just beginning to rise.
