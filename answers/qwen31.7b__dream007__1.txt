You decide to listen more, letting the words settle in the quiet of the room. The tension fades as you realize the friend's fears and hopes, and in that moment, you understand the depth of their feelings. The argument becomes a mirror, reflecting your own unspoken doubts, and you decide to hold your own heart open, knowing the truth is in the silence. You leave the room, carrying the weight of the conversation but also the weight of peace, your friendship now a bridge of understanding.
