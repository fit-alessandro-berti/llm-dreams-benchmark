settle it once and for all by proposing a challenge: a debate in front of a neutral judge. The judge is someone neither of you know personally, chosen randomly, to ensure fairness. Each of you prepares your arguments carefully, gathering evidence and rehearsing your points. The debate is intense, but respectful, and at the end, the judge declares a winner. Surprisingly, the verdict isn't as important as the realization you both have during the process—the disagreement was less about winning and more about understanding each other's perspectives. With this newfound clarity, you embrace and laugh, the tension dissolving into an old joke that only you both understand. The argument becomes a distant memory, and you feel closer than ever, the bond between you stronger than before.
