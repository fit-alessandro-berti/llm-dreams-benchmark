...realize you're standing in front of a presentation screen, but the words keep shifting and blurring whenever you try to read them. Your boss's face seems to stretch and distort as they tap their watch impatiently. 

You look down at your hands and notice you're holding a stack of papers, but when you try to focus on them, the text turns into strange symbols that seem to crawl across the page like insects. The office around you begins to expand impossibly - the ceiling stretches upward into darkness, and your coworkers' desks drift away like islands.

You try to speak, to explain that you need more time, but your voice comes out as barely a whisper. The deadline clock on the wall starts spinning wildly backward and forward. Suddenly, you remember you have a presentation to give, but you can't recall what it's about. 

Your computer keyboard feels sticky under your fingers, and when you type, random letters appear that spell out words in a language you don't recognize. The fluorescent lights above begin to flicker in rhythm with your heartbeat, growing brighter and brighter until everything dissolves into white light...

And then you feel that familiar falling sensation, your body jolting as you hover on the edge between sleep and waking.
