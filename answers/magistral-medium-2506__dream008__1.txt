suddenly realize that your desk is actually a giant, sentient hamster wheel. As you hesitantly take a seat, the wheel begins to spin on its own, accelerating wildly. Your boss transforms into a stern-faced circus ringmaster, shouting, "No breaks! The deadline is in five minutesâ€”*and the hamsters demand results!*"

You frantically try to type on your keyboard, but the keys melt into jelly, and your computer screen displays only a looping GIF of a clock spinning backward. Your coworkers, now dressed as clowns, juggle staplers and sing, *"Tick-tock, tick-tock, the deadlineâ€™s a joke!"*

Just as youâ€™re about to scream, the hamster wheel launches you into the airâ€”and you wake up in bed, clutching your alarm clock, which is flashing *"DEADLINE: NEVER."*

Would you like to explore this dreamâ€™s meaning, or should we make it even weirder? ðŸ˜„
