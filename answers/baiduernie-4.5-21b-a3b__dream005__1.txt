 each group seems to be deeply immersed in their own conversations, leaving you feeling a bit isolated. Despite this, you notice an intriguing stranger standing alone in a corner, observing the buzzing crowd. As you walk over to say hello, you notice a faint scar on their cheek that you find strangely captivating. The stranger introduces themselves as Lily, and you find yourself charmed by their quiet confidence and unique sense of style. As you start to talk, you realize that although the two of you have very different backgrounds, you share a common interest in storytelling and fantasy novels. You spend the rest of the evening lost in paperback worlds, breeze through stories, and laugh together in quiet moments. By the end of the night, you find yourself walking out the door with a new friend, and you're already looking forward to your next adventure with Lily in the fantastical tales you'll create together.
