...decide to step outside for some air, hoping the cool night might calm the fire between us. The city street is unusually quiet, bathed in the amber glow of streetlights that stretch our shadows long and thin, like silhouettes from another time. We walk in tense silence, the weight of unsaid words pressing down.

Then, the cobblestones beneath our feet begin to ripple—softly at first, like water disturbed by a pebble. I glance at my friend, whose face flickers between anger and something deeper—fear, maybe. The buildings along the sidewalk start to lean inward, their windows blinking like drowsy eyes. A clock tower in the distance chimes thirteen times, each note vibrating in my bones.

My friend turns to me, not with accusation, but with wonder. "Do you feel that?" they whisper. "It's like the world is remembering something we forgot."

And then it hits me—this isn’t just an argument. It’s a rift in something older than friendship, older than memory. We’ve been here before—in dreams, in lifetimes, in echoes. The disagreement wasn’t about politics, or betrayal, or love—it was a symbol, a key. And now the dream is unraveling, revealing the truth beneath: we were never two people, but two halves of the same voice, trying to reconcile.

The ground splits gently, not with violence, but like a book opening. A soft light rises from below, humming a melody we both know—some lullaby from childhood, half-remembered. My friend reaches for my hand. The anger melts into sorrow, then into understanding.

"We don’t have to win," they say. "We just have to listen."

And as our fingers touch, the city dissolves into stars. We’re floating above a sleeping earth, watching our lives unfold not as separate threads, but as one tapestry—woven with conflict, yes, but also with forgiveness, with return.

The dream doesn’t end. It widens. And somewhere in the waking world, two people on a cold street stop arguing... and finally breathe.
