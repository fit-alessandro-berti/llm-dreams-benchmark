**Dream Continuation:**  

You’re in your office, the hum of fluorescent lights echoing in your skull. The walls seem to lean inward, the chairs creaking like old bones. Your boss, a figure you half-remember from your early days at the company, strides in, a file clutched in his hand. His face is a mask of sternness, but his eyes—*those eyes*—waver, as if he’s seen something you haven’t.  

“Start the project,” he says, his voice a low, raspy whisper. “By noon. The client’s patience is thin, and the budget’s gone.”  

You stare at the file. It’s blank. The title is smudged: *“Project: Horizon.”* You feel a chill, not from the drafty window, but from the weight of the words. You try to ask questions, but your throat is dry, and the air tastes like static.  

You rush to your desk, but the keyboard is missing. The monitors flicker with static, then show a spiral staircase spiraling into a void. You try to call a colleague, but your phone is dead. The only sound is your own breath, loud and rapid, as if you’re drowning in it.  

Hours pass. The clock on the wall ticks backward. You scurry through the office, knocking over filing cabinets, but the other employees are gone—replaced by shadows with empty faces. You find a drawer labeled *“Urgent.”* Inside is a letter:  

*“To the one who dreams: The deadline is not a number. It’s a door. Open it, and the world will fold. Close it, and you’ll never wake up. Choose.”*  

You feel a pull—a whisper in your ear, a memory you can’t quite recall. The project is not a task but a test. You remember your childhood, your mother’s hands weaving threads into a tapestry that never ended. You remember the clock in your room that never ticked.  

You stand at the edge of the staircase, the spiral twisting into a mirror. Your reflection smiles, but your eyes are empty. You step into the mirror, and the office dissolves into a sky of stars. The deadline is no longer a clock but a heartbeat.  

When you wake up, the project is done. Your boss is gone. The file is gone. But in your palm, you hold a thread of light, and the stars are whispering your name.  

You don’t know if it was a dream or a warning. But you remember the spiral, and you hope the door is still open.
