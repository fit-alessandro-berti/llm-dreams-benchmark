...look down at your hands, only to realize you are holding a bowl of storm clouds. 

The project isn’t a report or a spreadsheet; it’s a requirement to organize the lightning before the sun sets, which is happening every thirty seconds outside the floor-to-ceiling windows. Your boss, whose face is a blurred reflection of a clock with no hands, taps a rhythmic, metallic beat on your desk. 

"The client needs the electricity sorted by scent," the boss whispers, though the voice sounds like it’s coming from inside your own ears. "And don't forget to staple the shadows to the floor."

You turn to your computer, but the keyboard has turned into a row of soft, overripe fruit. Every time you try to type a command, your fingers sink into a peach or a plum, and the screen merely displays a live feed of a deep-sea creature blinking in slow motion. 

The deadline is screaming—literally. A literal scream is coming from the digital clock on the wall, which is now melting downward like warm wax, the numbers pooling into a puddle of ink on the carpet. You try to stand up to explain that you don't have the right tools, but the floor has become thick, waist-high honey. 

Suddenly, the fluorescent lights above begin to hum a melody you haven't heard since childhood. The walls of the office begin to peel away like old wallpaper, revealing not the city outside, but a vast, silent forest of giant redwoods beneath a violet sky. 

Your boss hands you a stapler made of ice and says, "Hurry. The shadows are starting to float."

You take a deep breath, and as you reach out to catch a drifting shadow, you realize you aren't wearing shoes. You aren't even on the floor anymore. You are hovering inches above the honey, and the "impossible" deadline feels less like a task and more like a secret you are about to remember. 

Just as you are about to capture the first bolt of lightning, the sound of a distant, rhythmic beeping begins to echo through the trees... and the forest starts to fade into the gray light of morning.
