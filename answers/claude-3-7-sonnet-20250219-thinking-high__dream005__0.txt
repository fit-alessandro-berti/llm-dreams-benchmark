# Lost in the Gathering

You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and notice something strange—everyone's faces keep shifting slightly whenever you look away. You approach a circle of laughing people by a window that seems impossibly tall, stretching up into darkness.

\ you begin, but realize you can't quite remember what your friend looks like anymore.

\We're all looking for someone,\, her voice echoing more than it should. She offers you a drink in a glass that feels oddly heavy. When you sip it, the liquid tastes like childhood memories.

The room suddenly seems larger than before. You wander into another area where people are dancing to music you can hear but can't quite identify. The dancers move in perfect synchronization, too perfect, and when they turn, their shadows don't follow correctly.

You feel your phone vibrate. The text from your friend reads: \I'm in the room with the blue door.\ Looking up, you see dozens of doors, all different colors, all constantly changing hues.

As you move toward what seems to be a blue door, the floor beneath you becomes increasingly soft, like walking on wet sand. You realize your shoes have disappeared.

Will you ever find your friend in this place where nothing stays the same?
