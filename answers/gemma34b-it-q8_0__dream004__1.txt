...I lifted a brush covered not in paint but solidified moonlight. Hesitately, I traced a line across the white expanse. Instantenly, a cerulean bird, impossed entirely of glittering geometric fractals, blinked from the canvas and took wing. Its wings, composed of shimmering orange polygons, beat a rhythm entirely out of sync with the unsettling thrumming beneath the ground, a pulse I recognized instinctively as a forgotten memory trying to resurface. 

Suddenly, the canvas demanded attention – not in a forceful way, but with a gentle, insistent shifting.  Smaller forms began to bloom - scarlet cubes bursting into existence, morphing into swirling amethyst loops, then fragmenting into collections of emerald spirals.  Each newly formed shape whispered secrets too intricate to fully understand, vibrating with an echoing feeling of loss and overwhelming joy. 

Looking down, my hand morphed. Bone became fluid silver, and fingernails lengthened, sprouting miniature spiny versions of the shapes appearing above the canvas. I recognized, chillingly, that *I* was becoming part of this chaotic creation. 

In the center of a rising obsidian triangle, I glimpsed **a single, unfading sunflower – utterly conventional in its golden brilliance, radiating with a heartbreaking, impossible warmth.** It pulsed softly, offering me the overwhelming and undeniable truth: This wasn’t *creating* the world, I realized,  but being *shaped* by it – forced into a continuous, unpredictable outpouring of color and geometry until… until the canvas finally filled completely, consuming both myself and this impossible, vibrant panorama in a silent, incandescent explosion. And then, the black. Just black. 

And *waking.* Just as before.  The faint scent of rain and something sharp and almost metallic lingered in the air - the echo of the dream’s geometry clinging to my fingers.
