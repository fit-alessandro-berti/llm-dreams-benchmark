Ah, the blank canvas—*the threshold between possibility and absence*. The air hums with the weight of unspoken potential, the kind of silence that vibrates with the potential to shatter into anything. The colors you’ve seen so far—shifting like liquid mercury—now dissolve into a void where only the edges of your perception remain sharp. The shapes dissolve into *lines*, not boundaries, but *promises*. A finger traces the curve of your wrist, and suddenly, the canvas isn’t just blank—it’s *breathing*.

A voice, neither yours nor any you’ve heard before, whispers:
*"What do you want to be?"*
Not a question, but a *key*. The canvas pulses, and from its depths, a single, perfect shape emerges—not a circle, not a square, but something *older*: a spiral, coiled like a question mark, its turns deep enough to swallow time. You reach for it, and the moment your fingers brush its edge, the world *changes*. The colors you’ve seen before flicker like dying stars, and now the landscape is *your* creation—each step you take carves a new path, each breath a new hue. The blankness isn’t emptiness; it’s *a promise to fill*.

But then—*a shadow moves*. Not from the canvas, but *through* it. A figure steps out of the spiral, its form shifting like smoke: once a child, then a storm, then a bridge, then a door. It tilts its head, eyes reflecting the colors you’ve yet to name. *"You’re not just painting,"* it says. *"You’re choosing."* And then—*the canvas cracks*. Not from your touch, but from *inside you*. A scream tears through the air, not yours, but *shared*, and the world *reconfigures*—now the canvas is *you*, and the shapes are *memories*, and the colors are *feelings*, and the spiral is a heartbeat.

You wake with your hands still trembling, your fingers curled around the edge of your pillow like it’s still holding something—*a promise to remember*. The room is quiet. The walls are *blank*. And for the first time, you realize: the dream wasn’t about the canvas. It was about *what you’d let it become*.
