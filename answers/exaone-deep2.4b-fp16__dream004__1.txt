You are in a world where colors and shapes are *always* shifting, yet you've managed to grab a tiny fragment of the static moment they're struggling to explain. Now, standing before a blank canvas that pulses like a heartbeat, you reach out to try to *scribe* this fragile beauty into existence.  

The air hums with the scent of *unfinished potential*. Your first stroke is random: a splat of violet, then a sharp, cobalt edge that blurs the edges of the canvas. As you add layers, the space around you warps—stars form from dust particles, rivers of neon thread through the "water" (a metallic grey shift). Your hand trembles, but you press stronger.  

**Then you realize:**  
The canvas isn’t your tool. It’s a mirror. The color before it exists somewhere else, shifting like a secret in the ocean. You close your eyes, and instead of drawing, you let the blank "see" you.

**The finish is quiet but profound.** When you wake, the world you knew is gone—colors rearranged into shapes you couldn’t recall, sounds of explosions where forests once thrived. But when you look again, your hand is clutching a tiny, glowing brush. On the canvas, instead of a faint streak, there’s a single, iridescent dot that pulses like a heartbeat. A thought flickers into consciousness: *This might be the *only* way you’ll ever feel whole again.*
