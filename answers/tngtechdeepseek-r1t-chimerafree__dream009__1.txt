You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to find shelter before nightfall. The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth, and the distant clang of a blacksmith’s hammer echoes through the narrow, cobblestone streets. Around you, villagers in coarse woolen tunics bustle past, their faces weathered and wary. 

Your stomach growls, and you clutch the unfamiliar fabric of your own rough-spun clothing, wondering how you’ll survive without a coin to your name. A merchant eyes you suspiciously as you pass his stall of turnips and dried herbs, and you quicken your pace, heart pounding. 

Then you spot an old woman tending a herb garden outside a thatched cottage. Her gaze locks onto yours, sharp and knowing. “Lost, are ye?” she croaks, her voice like wind through reeds. “Come inside. The woods aren’t safe after dark—not with the wolves, nor the lord’s men.” 

As you step into the dim, firelit hut, she hands you a clay bowl of stew. “Eat,” she says. “Then tell me how a soul like yours slipped through the cracks of time.” 

Outside, the village bell tolls, and somewhere in the distance, a dog howls. The dream lingers, unanswered, as you wonder: *Is this a curse… or a chance to begin again?*
