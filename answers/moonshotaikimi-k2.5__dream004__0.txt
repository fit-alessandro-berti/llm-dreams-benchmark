and realize it is the only still point in this kaleidoscope universe. While spiraling mountains dissolve into purple mist and the sky refracts through crystalline rain that falls upward, the canvas remains stubbornly, perfectly white—rectangle of silence amid the chromatic storm.

You reach out, and the moment your fingertips brush the surface, the blankness ripples. Not paint, but *possibility* spreads from your touch. The canvas doesn't accept color; it inverts it. The shifting auroras of the dream world begin to drain into its fibers, sucking the lavender from the clouds, the mercury from the melting trees, the gold from the breathing soil. 

As the landscape around you fades to grayscale, the canvas explodes into hyper-saturation. It is no longer blank but *pregnant* with every hue that ever existed simultaneously. You watch as your own hands begin to lose definition, becoming watercolor blots that drip upward toward the frame. 

You understand then—this is not a canvas for creating, but for *remembering*. You step through the white rectangle, and on the other side, you find yourself standing in a room where someone is sleeping, their eyelids fluttering as they dream of colors and shapes constantly changing, and of a figure stepping out from a painting that hasn't been painted yet.

The dream breathes. You breathe with it. The canvas waits behind you, still blank, still ready.
