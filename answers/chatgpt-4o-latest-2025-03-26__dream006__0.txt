speak—but no sound comes out. Your mouth moves, your thoughts are clear, but your voice seems to have vanished. The auditorium remains silent except for a distant murmur, like wind rustling in the far-off trees.

You look down and realize you’re not holding your notes. In fact, they're drifting beside you, suspended in the air, the pages slowly fluttering like leaves caught in a gentle breeze. You reach for them, but they float away, out of reach, as the stage begins to stretch—growing wider, deeper, the audience receding into a hazy distance.

Panic starts to rise, but then, from somewhere in the first row, a child’s voice calls your name. You look down, and the audience has transformed. Not a crowd of strangers anymore, but faces you recognize—old friends, long-lost loved ones, even people you’ve never met but somehow *know* in the way dreams allow.

Your voice returns suddenly, and it feels like breaking the surface of water after being submerged. You begin to speak—not from your notes, not from memory—but from your heart. And instead of a microphone, your words form floating shapes in the air, glowing softly, as the audience listens—not just hearing, but absorbing everything you say.

Then applause erupts—not loud or frantic, but warm, like sunlight cresting over a mountain ridge. The stage tilts upward gently, lifting you until you're walking on a path of stars, each step echoing with a soft chime. You look back once more before stepping forward into the unknown, the dream folding behind you like the final page of a book.

And then—

You wake up.
