feel a wave of panic wash over you. The office around you starts to distort, walls stretching and bending like they’re made of rubber. Your computer screen flickers, displaying garbled text and strange symbols you’ve never seen before. You glance at your boss, but their face seems blurred, unrecognizable, as if it’s hidden behind a shifting mist.

You try to speak, to explain that the task is impossible, but no words come out. Instead, you see your hands moving on their own, typing furiously on the keyboard. The keys light up in vibrant colors, and your hands seem to be creating something brilliant, though you have no idea what it is.

Suddenly, the room darkens, and a deep voice echoes from nowhere: “The deadline is an illusion. Finish the project, and you will uncover the truth.” Your fingers keep typing faster and faster, the keyboard glowing brighter until the light engulfs the entire room.

When the brightness fades, you find yourself no longer in the office but in a vast cosmic library filled with floating books and glowing scrolls. A shimmering figure approaches you and whispers, "You're close to understanding. Solve the puzzle before you wake." 

What do you do next?
