…wander through streets unlike any you’ve seen before. The architecture is a mix of ancient stone towers sprouting electronic billboards and futuristic metal walkways. Overhead, thin ribbons of luminescent glass form dazzling canopies, diffusing a perpetual twilight over cobblestone avenues. There are no cars—just strange, sleek pods that hover inches above the ground, and tall, narrow buses with doors that open like blossoming flowers.

You hurry along, checking your watch, but it’s not the watch you remember owning. Instead, it’s a small, floating holographic display that flickers with alien symbols. You try to tap it for clues, but it only glows brighter, the characters dancing away from your touch. You know the meeting time is approaching, and panic begins to set in. Each alley you choose leads you somewhere new and unexpected: a boulevard lined with enormous sculptures of nameless heroes, a market square where the language on the vendors’ lips is musical but incomprehensible. 

You stop at a corner where a person—at least you think they’re a person—stands, draped in layered garments of shimmering blue. Their eyes reflect the city’s lights as they peer at you with gentle concern. You ask them, “Excuse me, do you know where I’m supposed to be? I have a meeting, and I don’t know the location.” To your relief, they answer in words you can understand, though their voice echoes like a chorus:

“You must go beyond the clock spire and into the garden of soft chimes. Listen for the notes that rise and fall like breathing, and you’ll know you’re close.”

The person points across a bridge carved from translucent stone. You follow it, heart pounding. Beneath the bridge, a slow, silvery river carries glowing orbs downstream, each orb holding miniature silhouettes—tiny dreams sailing on luminous currents. As you cross, you feel strangely lighter, as though you’re shedding layers of worry with each step. On the other side, the city is quieter. The sound of distant laughter and mysterious music drifts on the air. The buildings here have organic shapes, balconies overgrown with bioluminescent vines that hum softly in the hush.

After a few turns, you come upon a slender tower crowned by a mechanical clock—its hands made of polished copper, ticking softly in a rhythm that doesn’t match your watch. The face of the clock is intricately carved with symbols that seem to morph as you stare. Just beyond this tower is a small gateway leading into a secluded garden. You hear them before you see them: gentle chimes, each note accompanied by a puff of iridescent mist. You step inside and the garden welcomes you with dappled light and a soft breeze that carries the scent of jasmine and something sweeter, stranger.

In the center of the garden is a clearing with a low stone table. Seated around it are figures in robes woven with threads of stardust. They watch you approach and smile. One of them, with eyes that seem ancient and kind, gestures for you to join them. As you walk closer, you realize that you’ve made it—this is your meeting, the crucial gathering that has pulled you through the city’s labyrinth. Yet, you cannot recall who these people are, or what they represent, only that you are safe here, that you belong.

They ask no questions, as though understanding your silent disorientation. Instead, one presents you with an intricate device—something between a compass and a kaleidoscope. When you peer into it, you see reflections of your own dreams spinning like galaxies. Another figure speaks words you cannot recall upon waking, but which wrap around you like a promise. The chimes sing softly in the background. Your heart calms.

You sit with them and the hour melts away. The meeting you feared missing is not about time or place, but about finding your center in a world of shifting streets and unfamiliar faces. As the dream begins to fade, you’re left with a sense of profound calm, understanding that sometimes, the meeting you’re desperately trying to reach lies not in the city’s secret corners, but in the quiet garden within yourself.
