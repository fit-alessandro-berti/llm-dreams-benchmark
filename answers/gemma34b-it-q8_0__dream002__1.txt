Okay, here's that dream completion! Here's what happens after reaching a dramatic shift in weather:

...You are walking along barely shaded trail, sunlight dappling through the leaves like gold dust as a gentle breeze kissed your skin. The air smelled of pine and damp earth, almost too calm for that deep of a wood. You felt utterly content, lost delightfully in my own, peaceful thoughts. Then, almost instantly, the air shifted. It thickened, becoming heavy with moisture. The playful breeze sharpened into a biting wind. Above you, the once clear blue sky bruised into shades of charcoal grey and swirling purple. The sunlight vanished abruptly, swallowed whole by the gathering storm clouds.

Instead of a gentle patter, huge, shockingly loud rumbles of thunder ripped through the woods. It shook you to the bone.  The trees, once silent and stoic, began to twist and groan in the wind, their thick branches thrashing wildly. Rain—icy, almost white rain—started in a drizzle, transforming into a blinding sheet clinging to your cheeks and clothes.

In front of you, the trail completely vanished beneath a churned-in torrent. But, bizarrely, the ground was *illuminated*. Not by sunlight, but by a network of glowing blue veins – pulsing with an inner light - that etched themselves into the forest floor itself. And they were drawing further, further across the trail, converging right in *your* direction. 

A chorus of voices started, soft at first but quickly intensifying as they reached a deafening volume. It wasn't words, exactly, but a rush of emotions – fear, longing, regret, and recognition – all swirling around you, threatening to overwhelm my thoughts. I struggled to open my eyes, to understand *who,* or *what*, they belonged to. 

I bent down, clutching at the flooded ground, desperately needing something to hold onto as everything shifted, and in my outstretched hand, I slowly realized wasn't damp earth at all… but a single, shimmering, purple amethyst, pulsating with the same ethereal blue light as the roots beneath my feet….
