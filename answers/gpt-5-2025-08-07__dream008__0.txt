…and you say, “Of course,” because that is what mouths do when the air in the room belongs to someone else. Your chair rolls forward on its own. The project brief opens like a window; inside it is a horizon with the word NOON painted across it, already leaning toward the west.

The cursor blinks in the document, a tiny metronome keeping time with your pulse. You put your fingers on the keyboard and the keys give like wet clay. The N sticks to your fingertip. The L slides away. Letters climb the screen, change their minds, and drop off the edge with a faint, papery sigh.

“Whenever you’re ready,” your boss says, smiling the way a closed laptop smiles—thin, taut, not giving anything. His tie is a measuring tape that unspools toward your chest, counting your breath. He is very good at waiting. He folds his waiting into neat little squares and stacks them where you can see them.

The clock on the wall lurches forward, then stutters. It coughs up sixty seconds at once like coins. Emails fly past the windows, a flock of white envelopes wheeling and turning, dropping shadows like check marks across the desks. The printer purrs in the corner and produces a single page that reads HURRY in a dozen fonts.

You begin. You build a slide. The slide becomes a hallway. You walk down it, and it leads to another slide, and another, each one promising an objective and opening into a room with no doors. The numbers you need are asleep in the break room, wrapped in napkins. You pour coffee over them. They dissolve into a sweet syrup that stains your hands.

“Just start,” your boss says, as if starting were a lever and not a small act of faith. You open the project plan and it’s a mirror. You open the calendar and it’s a mouth. You open your notebook and a small wind comes out of it and scatters your notes so they arrange themselves into a sentence that reads, This is familiar.

You stand. The carpet is made of sticky notes. Your shoes pick up tasks. You try to move and the notes multiply, their neon corners peeking from your soles. The more you lift your feet, the more they whisper. ASAP, ASAP, ASAP. The elevator arrives and its buttons are all labeled NOW. The door closes and there is only one floor: URGENT. You press it and the elevator doesn’t move; instead, the building slides past you, floors unscrolling like film, each office a frame where someone is starting and starting and starting.

At your desk again, you look at the clock. The numbers on its face are not numbers anymore. They are small fish, silver and restless, flicking their tails. You try to read them and they dart away. You laugh because it is either that or wind the measuring-tape tie around your wrist until your hand is a fist.

“Do you need anything?” your boss asks. His voice is the soft click of a pen. He is so patient it feels like pressure.

“Yes,” you say, surprising yourself. “Time.”

He nods, as if you’ve asked for a stapler. “Take what you need.” He turns his waiting over and pats its underside. It purrs.

You reach toward the wall clock. It’s high, but the ceiling lowers itself to help you out. You peel the clock down like fruit. It is heavier than it looks. You lift it to your mouth and bite. The hour hand crunches between your teeth. It tastes like oranges and graphite. Juice runs down your wrist. The second hand goes quiet in your cheek. You swallow. The room exhales. The flock of emails drifts apart and becomes snow. It falls straight up.

“Good,” your boss says, and now his tie is just cloth, pooling on the desk like a river that forgot where it was going. “We only needed you to do that.”

The project on your screen compresses itself into a single word: Begin. You touch it and it opens like a door to the office you wish you worked in: the windows are really sky, the lights are a soft rain of ideas, and every task is the size of your hand. You pick one up. It is warm. It hums. You fit it to another and they click into place with the satisfaction of magnets finding their purpose.

You notice your breath. It has been here the whole time, faithful, rolling in and out of you like a tide that never asks for thanks. The deadline on the horizon sits down beside you on the floor and takes off its shoes. It wiggles its toes and sighs. You draw a line across the carpet with your finger. It becomes a river. The deadline steps over it and becomes a shoreline, then a path, then a word you can carry in your pocket.

“Perfect,” your boss says, but he’s softer now, his edges smoothing into a plant on the windowsill that has needed water and finally gets it. He looks at you with leaves. He is not waiting anymore. He is growing.

You type. The letters stick where you place them. They do not wander. The hallway stays a slide and the slide stays a slide and it takes your ideas gently from here to there like a slow, bright conveyor belt. Noon strolls in, unhurried, and sits beside you. It rests its head on your shoulder for a moment, companionable.

Somewhere far off, a sound starts: the cricket you keep meaning to find. It chirps exactly three times. The light in the office folds itself into a suitcase. The project saves itself. The snow of emails melts into rain that patters the ceiling and then becomes applause and then becomes your alarm.

You wake with the taste of orange on your tongue and the knowledge that you can borrow a little time if you remember where you put your teeth. You lie there and watch your ceiling, and there is no clock on it, and nothing is waiting except the morning, which is patient, and your breath, which keeps beginning.
