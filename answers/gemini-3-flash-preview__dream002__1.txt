the emerald canopy above begins to thrash, not from the wind, but as if the trees themselves are shivering in anticipation. The air, once warm and smelling of pine needle mulch, turns suddenly sharp and cold, carrying the scent of ozone and crushed violets.

You look up, and the sky isn't turning gray; it’s turning a deep, pulsating indigo. The clouds don't drift—they swirl into a massive, slow-motion whirlpool directly above you. 

As the first crack of thunder echoes, it doesn't sound like a crash. It sounds like a deep, resonant cello note that vibrates in your very teeth. You start to run, looking for shelter, but the ground beneath your feet begins to feel soft, like walking on a heavy velvet quilt. Every step you take leaves a footprint that glows with a faint, bioluminescent gold.

The rain begins to fall, but the droplets are heavy and warm. They don't soak your skin; instead, they bead up and roll off like liquid mercury, tinkling like tiny bells as they hit the leaves. 

You find a massive hollowed-out cedar tree and duck inside. From the safety of the trunk, you watch the forest transform. The wind picks up, and as it whips through the branches, the leaves begin to detach and hover in the air, spinning in perfect geometric patterns. The storm isn't destroying the forest—it’s rearranging it.

Suddenly, the wind drops to a dead whisper. A single bolt of white lightning strikes the center of the clearing, but there is no fire. Where the bolt hit, a door made of shimmering water stands upright in the grass, rippling with the reflection of a city you’ve never seen but somehow remember perfectly.

You realize the storm didn't come to hunt you. It came to bring you your way home. You step out from the tree, the mercury rain parting around you, and walk toward the door of water as the indigo sky begins to dissolve into the white light of a waking mind.
