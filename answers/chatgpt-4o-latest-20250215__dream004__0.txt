a floating paintbrush that hums softly in your hand. The moment you touch the bristles to the canvas, colors explode like liquid light, swirling and shifting before settling into a scene you don’t fully understand. It’s a doorway—tall, ornate, and pulsing with a golden glow.

A voice, distant yet familiar, whispers, *Step through.*

Hesitant but curious, you move forward, and the instant you cross the threshold, gravity bends. You’re floating now, drifting through a sky that ripples like water. Beneath you, a city of glass rises and falls, reshaping itself as if it’s breathing.

Then, a figure emerges from the shifting structures—someone you almost recognize. Their face flickers like a dream half-remembered.

*"You’re painting this,"* they say, reaching out to touch your hand. And in that moment, you realize they’re right. The brush is still in your grip, and every thought, every breath you take alters the world around you.

But what will you create next?
