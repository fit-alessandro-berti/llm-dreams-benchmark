feel a wave of relief wash over you. Their warm smiles and genuine concern make the overwhelming city seem a little less daunting. One of them, an older woman with gentle eyes, pulls out a worn map and begins pointing to landmarks, her voice calm and reassuring. Another stranger, a young man with a backpack, excitedly shares stories about his favorite hidden spots in the city, offering to guide you there if you have time.

As they talk, you notice how their kindness seems to ripple through the crowd around you—people slowing down, smiling more, even offering suggestions or directions as they pass by. For the first time since arriving in this unfamiliar place, you feel like maybe being lost isn’t such a bad thing after all. It’s led you here, to these people who remind you that connection can bloom in the most unexpected moments.

Together, you start walking, weaving through streets filled with colorful storefronts and tantalizing aromas wafting from food carts. The group points out murals on building walls, sharing bits of history and laughter along the way. You realize that what started as a moment of loneliness has turned into something magical—a shared journey where strangers become friends, and the city no longer feels so vast or cold.

And just as you think it couldn’t get any better, one of them says, “We’re almost there. But tell us—where is it you truly want to go?” 

You pause for a moment, unsure at first, but then smile softly. Maybe the answer doesn’t matter right now. What matters is the path you’re on—and the company you’ve found along the way.
