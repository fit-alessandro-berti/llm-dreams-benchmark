...the trees begin to whisper in a language you somehow understand. Their leaves shimmer and turn silver, like thousands of tiny mirrors reflecting a sky that's now swirling with impossible colors - purple lightning crackling through orange clouds.

You realize you're not wearing shoes, but your feet aren't cold. Instead, each step makes the ground beneath you glow with soft bioluminescent light, leaving a trail of blue footprints that fade slowly behind you like dying stars.

The storm never quite arrives. It hovers at the edge of the forest, waiting, breathing. You find an ancient door standing alone between two oak trees - no walls, just a door. Through its keyhole, you can hear the ocean, though you're miles from any shore.

Your childhood pet appears beside you, young again, and gives you a knowing look before walking straight through the door without opening it. You reach for the handle, and it feels warm, like it's been waiting for you.

The moment you turn it, you're back at the beginning of the path, walking through the peaceful forest, but now you're carrying something in your pocket you didn't have before - something small and heavy that hums with its own quiet music.

The storm is approaching again, but this time, you smile.
