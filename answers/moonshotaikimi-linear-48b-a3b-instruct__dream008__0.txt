…feel the familiar buzz of fluorescent lights overhead flicker like a dying firefly. The walls seem to lean in, breathing. Your boss stands at the threshold, a silhouette cut from shadow, clutching the impossible brief with fingers that bend too far, as if made of aluminum foil.

He speaks, but his voice is a low, wet rustle—like pages being pulled from a wet book. *"You have until midnight,"* he says. *"The deadline… it’s always been there."*

You look down. Your hands are己 not quite yours anymore; your fingertips have sprouted tiny clock-faces, ticking in every direction. Time drips from you like ink from a fountain pen. The room rearranges itself—ceiling tilts to the floor, files crawl across the walls like ants, and your desk, once a slab of cheap laminate, now pulses like a heart made of oak.

You try to move, but your shoes have fused to the carpet. Each step you take peels back a strip of time, revealing the floor beneath—yesterday’s carpet, last year’s carpet, the same carpet from the century before last. Somewhere in the distance, a phone rings. It isn’t yours. It’s always been ringing, always will be.

You look at the brief again. It’s blank, but you can feel it filling itself with your memories—birthdays blur into bullet points, childhood birthdays shrink to footnotes. You read your own life back to yourself like a secondhand story.

Then your boss smiles, and his mouth opens sideways, revealing a long hallway lined with closed doors. Each door is labeled with a version of yourself, all of them stuck somewhere between “almost done” and “never started.”

*“Pick one,”* he whispers. *“But remember—whatever’s behind that door, midnight is already here.”*

You turn. The clock on your wrist ticks backward. You step forward.
