...you follow them down a narrow alleyway lit only by flickering neon signs, the air thick with the smell of rain-washed pavement and distant street food. Their footsteps echo softly, but they don’t speak — instead, they move with quiet purpose, guiding you through twists and turns that seem to rewrite the city’s layout. You glance back, and for a moment, the alley stretches impossibly long, the buildings folding in on themselves like origami. But then you’re back in motion.

One of them — a woman with silver hair woven with tiny glowing threads — stops and points ahead. There, where a crumbling brick wall should be, a door made of shimmering glass appears, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat. She smiles, not with her mouth, but with her eyes, and hands you a small, warm compass. The needle doesn’t point north — it points *toward you*, vibrating gently in your palm.

Then, one by one, they dissolve into strands of light, not disappearing, but *melting* into the city itself — their energy flowing into the lampposts, the graffiti, the rhythm of traffic. You stand alone again, but the loneliness is gone. You press your hand against the glass door, and it opens silently.

Beyond it isn’t another street.

It’s a quiet meadow, starlit and full of flowers that hum in soft, ancient harmonies. A voice — light, familiar, but not quite one you’ve heard before — whispers on the wind: *“You weren’t lost. You were being found.”*

And in that moment, you understand: the city wasn’t a maze. It was a dream too — and you were the dreamer.  
You take a step forward, barefoot on the grass, and everything begins to make sense.
