"The wind howls like a low-frequency rumble, and the first crackles of thunder become subtle tremors beneath the soil. Darkened clouds stretch into jagged shadows overhead, casting jagged silhouettes as the forest above seems to sigh under the approaching gaze of an unstable sky. A single leaf slips from a branch and falls with a splash, then the air becomes visibly humid, and you swear—squints appear in thedistance." 

This builds tension by layering sensory details (humming ground, whispers of thunder, visual shadows of clouds) while hinting at the storm’s unfolding chaos. The resolution hints at both danger and the forest’s responsiveness, leaving the reader eager to see how the protagonist confronts this change.
