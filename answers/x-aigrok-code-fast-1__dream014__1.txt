### The Dream Unfolds

The strangers, a motley crew of dream-weavers with glowing auras and mismatched clothes, smile warmly and take your hand. "Don't worry, wanderer," says the one in a top hat, her voice like wind chimes. They lead you through the neon-lit streets, where skyscrapers twist like vines and taxis hover like fireflies. One stranger, a burly man with a pirate's scarf, pulls out a crystal compass that hums and points the way. "Your destination is here," he says, gesturing to a hidden alley where a portal shimmers—a doorway to a meadow of floating lanterns.

### The Twist

As you step through, the city behind you fades, and you find yourself home—your real home, filled with warmth and familiarity. The strangers wave goodbye, their kindness a lingering echo: "Remember, you're never truly lost when others care." You wake up smiling, realizing the dream was a reminder that help often arrives in unexpected forms. What happens next in your adventure?
