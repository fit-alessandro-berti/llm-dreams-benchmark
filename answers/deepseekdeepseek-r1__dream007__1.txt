You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to... raise your voices one last time, only to notice the air around you thicken, your angry words materializing as jagged shards of ice, hovering between you. Each accusation, each interruption, freezes into glittering, knife-like shapes. You both freeze, breathless, as the room fills with their cold, sharp presence.  

Then your friend’s eyes widen—not in anger, but in awe. They reach out, hesitating, and touch one of the icicles. It melts instantly, dripping into a pool of water that reflects both your faces, twisted with frustration and fear. Slowly, you begin to speak again, but softer now, each deliberate word dissolving another shard. With every sentence, the room warms, the floor blooming with sudden wildflowers where the water falls.  

By the time the last ice vanishes, you’re sitting cross-legged amid the blossoms, exhausted but calm. “I didn’t realize,” your friend murmurs, plucking a flower, “how much it hurt just to be heard.” You nod, the dream already fading, but the scent of petals lingers—a fragile, hopeful truce.
