...feel a strange lightness in my feet. It's not the usual pre-speech jitters, more like... I'm floating? I glance down, and sure enough, my polished shoes are hovering a good inch above the polished stage floor. Panic flares, but it's a distant, muffled panic, like it's happening to someone else.

I try to plant my feet firmly, but they won't obey. Instead, I start to drift upwards, slowly at first, then with increasing speed. The expectant faces in the audience begin to tilt upwards, following my ascent. Murmurs ripple through the crowd, a mix of confusion and amusement. Some people are pointing, others are taking out their phones to record me, the speaker who literally took off.

I try to speak, to begin my carefully prepared speech on the importance of grounded perspectives (the irony is not lost on me, even in this dream), but my voice comes out as a high-pitched squeak. The microphone on the podium, which I'm now several feet above, seems miles away.

As I rise higher, the individual faces blur into a sea of upturned heads. The stage lights become harsh, blinding spots. I can see the ornate ceiling of the auditorium, decorated with swirling patterns that I've never noticed before. They seem to pulse and breathe, the colours shifting subtly.

Then, just as I think I'm going to hit the ceiling, I pass right through it. It's like going through a layer of cool, shimmering water. I'm outside, floating above the building, the city lights spread out below me like a scattered handful of jewels.

And that's when I realize, with a dizzying, exhilarating rush, that I can control my movement. I think "down," and I gently descend. I think "left," and I drift sideways, the cool night air rushing past my face. I'm flying. I'm actually *flying*. The speech, the audience, the panic – all of it fades into insignificance, replaced by the pure, unadulterated joy of weightless freedom. I swoop and soar through the night sky, laughing a sound that echoes off the distant skyscrapers, a sound that's not a squeak, but a full-throated, joyous cry. And the city, once a source of nervous anticipation, becomes my playground. I wonder how high I can go... I think to myself, "To the moon!"...and I start to ascend, faster and faster, the twinkling stars growing larger, closer...
