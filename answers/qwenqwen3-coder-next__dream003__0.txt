…whispers—faint, melodic, like wind through ancient glass chimes—rising from the box’s surface. Your fingers trace the patterns: not etched metal or carved wood, but *living light*, shimmering in shifting hues of indigo and silver. The lines aren’t static—they breathe, pulse, and rearrange themselves as you watch, forming constellations that mirror the night sky outside your window… yet you’re indoors, in a place you don’t recognize.

Then, a realization blooms:  
The box isn’t locked with metal or mechanism.  
It’s sealed by *inattention*.

You remember reading somewhere—somewhere true—that attention is the only key. You close your eyes. Breathe. Not to *force* it open, but to *listen*.  

A whisper threads through your thoughts, soft as silk:  
*“What do you most fear to open?”*

Your heart stutters. Not a monster, not a terror—but a memory: the last time you left something unsaid. The last time you walked away before saying *I’m sorry*, *I miss you*, *I’m still here*.

The box glows warmer. The light softens. A seam opens—not with a click, but with a sigh—and inside, instead of treasure or warning, lies a single, folded letter. Its envelope is blank. Yours is the first hand that has touched it in years.

The dream doesn’t tell you what it says.  
It only shows you the weight of it.  
And the trembling hope in your own fingers, reaching for the fold.  

Then—the alarm rings.  
You wake… and your palm still tingles with the warmth of that box.
