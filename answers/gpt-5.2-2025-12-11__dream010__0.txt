…you start to notice that the competition isn’t being held in any normal building. It’s taking place inside a vast, shifting office that rearranges itself between breaths—cubicles folding into staircases, elevators opening onto beaches, conference rooms floating like glass bubbles in a dark sky. Overhead, a calm voice announces each round the way an airport announces delays.

“Contestants,” it says, “please proceed to the next assessment: *Prove you belong.*”

You look down and realize you aren’t wearing your own clothes. You’re dressed like a version of yourself you’ve never met: polished, capable, and somehow already tired. Around you, other competitors wait in a loose circle, each holding an object that seems absurdly personal. A woman grips a cracked violin bow. Someone else holds a child’s report card. A man carries a stapler like it’s a weapon.

You check your hands. There’s something there too: a thin folder with your name typed on the tab in the exact font every job rejection email has ever used.

The first challenge is a hallway of doors.

Each door has a job title on it—some you wanted once, some you never dared to want, some you don’t recognize but feel in your bones. The rules appear on the wall in neat corporate lettering:

1. Choose three doors.  
2. Enter alone.  
3. Do not bring back anything that doesn’t belong to you.

People rush forward, confident, grabbing doorknobs like lottery tickets. You stand still, watching. The doors hum quietly, like servers in a locked room.

You pick the first door that makes your stomach flip: **“The Role You Told Everyone You Wanted.”**

Inside is a stage. Bright lights. A mic. An audience of colleagues—every former classmate, every coworker you ever wanted to impress, every person who ever underestimated you. The host beckons you to speak. There’s a teleprompter, but it’s blank.

A spotlight finds you with surgical precision.

You open your mouth, and the only thing that comes out is the sound of a printer struggling with a paper jam.

The audience laughs—not cruelly, not kindly. Just as if that’s what the scene calls for.

You glance down. In your folder, a page has appeared: **“Performance Review: Needs to be more authentic.”**

Your cheeks burn. You try again. This time words come, but they’re not the lines you planned. You hear yourself saying what you never say in interviews: that you’re afraid. That you want to be good at something that matters. That you’re tired of selling a version of yourself you can’t inhabit for long without disappearing.

The laughter stops. The audience becomes still, like a paused video.

The host nods once and stamps your folder: **PASS.**

You back out of the door, heart pounding, and the hallway looks different—as if it approves of you a fraction more.

For the second door, you choose **“The Role You Think You Don’t Deserve.”**

Inside is a narrow room with a single desk and a single task: a mountain of work, impossible in quantity, each item labeled with a deadline that reads *yesterday*. The only tool on the desk is a red pen.

You start to panic immediately, flipping through tasks. The red pen bleeds through the pages, staining your fingers. No matter what you complete, the pile grows. Your throat tightens. The air smells like cold coffee and old anxiety.

Then you notice a small trash bin under the desk. It’s empty, waiting.

You hesitate. The rules didn’t say you couldn’t throw things away.

You begin to cross out half the tasks. Not “later.” Not “maybe.” Just *no.* You toss pages into the bin like you’re shedding skins. With each discarded sheet, the room gets wider. The ceiling lifts. The fluorescent buzzing fades.

The pile shrinks into something human.

On the last page, the red pen writes by itself, slow and deliberate: **“Boundary set.”**

A stamp lands in your folder: **PASS.**

You exit quickly, dizzy with relief.

For the third door, you don’t choose a title you recognize. You choose the one that feels like standing at the edge of a cliff: **“The Role That Costs You Something.”**

Inside is a mirror maze, except the mirrors don’t reflect you. They reflect versions of you at different ages—some confident, some hollow-eyed, some laughing, some crying in bathrooms you remember too clearly. They move when you move, but not the same way.

In the center is a small podium with a button labeled **SUBMIT APPLICATION.**

A familiar voice—your own, but younger—says, “If you press it, you’ll get the job. But you have to choose what you lose.”

A list appears on the podium like a drop-down menu:

- Sleep  
- Stability  
- Approval  
- Time  
- Certainty  
- A person who only loves you when you’re smaller  
- The story you tell about who you are

You reach out and freeze.

Behind you, the mirrors whisper in overlapping tones: *Pick approval. It’s easiest.*  
*Pick sleep. Everyone does.*  
*Pick certainty. You don’t even have much of it.*  
*Pick the story. It was never true anyway.*

Your finger hovers. Your chest aches with the weight of what you’ve been carrying without naming.

And then you realize the trick: the competition isn’t asking what you’re willing to sacrifice for work. It’s asking what you’re willing to sacrifice to keep avoiding the life you want.

You select: **The story you tell about who you are.**

The maze shudders. The mirrors crack in thin, clean lines, like ice breaking on a lake. Not shattering—opening.

A new reflection appears in each mirror: you, as you are right now, looking straight back. No performance. No apology. Just present.

Your folder is stamped: **PASS.**

When you step out, the hallway is gone.

You’re in an enormous atrium filled with desks arranged like a chessboard. At each desk sits a competitor, typing furiously, trying to outpace one another. Above them, a scoreboard ticks numbers up and up—emails sent, tasks completed, hours logged, achievements unlocked. The air is electric with urgency.

A door at the far end reads: **FINAL ROUND.**

The announcer’s voice returns, softer now.

“Finalists,” it says, “your last challenge is simple: convince us why you should win.”

A panel waits behind a long table—faceless silhouettes in suits made of shadow. They don’t move, but you feel them watching with the weight of every authority figure you ever handed your worth to.

A microphone rises from the floor in front of you.

You walk to it.

Your folder opens by itself, and inside is everything: your grades, your mistakes, your half-finished projects, your best moments, your worst emails, the times you were brave, the times you were petty, the times you stayed too long, the times you left too soon. Paper spills like a life being audited.

The silhouettes lean forward.

You clear your throat.

You could pitch. You could polish. You could perform.

Instead, you look down at the messy heap of pages and say, quietly, “I don’t want a job that requires me to abandon myself to earn it.”

The room goes silent in a different way than before—not the tense silence of judgment, but the spacious silence of something true landing.

One of the silhouettes raises a hand. A stamp appears in the air, hovering over your folder, waiting.

“Define,” the silhouette says, voice like distant thunder, “your dream job.”

You think about it. Not the title. Not the salary. Not the admiration. Not the fantasy of becoming someone else. The actual shape of your days.

You say, “It’s work where I can be curious without being punished for not knowing. It’s work where I can make things that help people. It’s work with boundaries, with rest, with room for my life. It’s work that asks me to grow, not to shrink.”

The silhouettes don’t react.

The stamp doesn’t move.

For a terrifying moment you believe you’ve failed.

Then, from somewhere behind you, you hear a chair scrape.

You turn.

In the atrium, the competitors have stopped typing. One by one they’re looking up from their screens, listening. The scoreboard flickers. The numbers stutter and begin to reset, dropping like a drained battery.

The announcer’s voice breaks character, sounding almost human.

“That answer,” it says, “was not among the approved responses.”

A ripple of fear runs through you.

Then it continues, softer: “Which is how we know it belongs to you.”

The stamp comes down with a thunderous **WINNER** that shakes dust from the ceiling.

But instead of confetti, the whole place begins to dissolve—desks melting into water, lights becoming early morning sun, the shadow panel thinning into mist. Your folder turns into a blank notebook in your hands.

The grand prize door appears in front of you, plain and unmarked.

You reach for the knob.

It’s warm, like someone’s hand.

When you open it, you don’t step into an office.

You step into a morning.

A real one: soft light through a window, the quiet hum of a city waking up, the smell of something comforting you can’t quite name. There’s a desk, yes, but there’s also a plant you know you’ll forget to water until it droops dramatically. There are tools you recognize—your tools. There’s a calendar that includes space for rest like it’s a non-negotiable meeting.

On the wall is a single sentence, handwritten, uneven, clearly not corporate:

**“Make something true. Then stop.”**

You sit down, and your hands don’t feel like they’re auditioning anymore. They feel like they belong to you.

Behind you, the competition’s voice says one last thing, almost fond:

“You can begin whenever you’re ready.”

You look at the blank page in the notebook.

For the first time in the dream, no one is watching.

And you start.
