The dream continues, thick with salt spray and the roar of the tempest:

You grip the wheel, knuckles white as the storm worsens. Waves, black as tar and crowned with foam, rise like mountains on every side. Your ship, a sturdy but aging galleon named *The Meridian's Hope*, pitches violently. A deafening crack echoes – a sail torn free, whipping wildly in the gale. Rain lashes your face like icy shards.

Your crew scrambles, clinging to rigging or shouting over the wind's howl. First Mate Jansen stumbles up from below, rain-drenched and wide-eyed. "Captain! Mainmast is listing bad! The carpenter says the keel's taking water faster than the pumps can shift it! We can't hold her like this for long!"

You scan the churning sea, the roiling grey sky where lightning flickers constantly, revealing monstrous wave walls poised to crash. Fear is a cold knot in your gut, but it's buried deep. Your crew – raw, scared, looking to *you* – cannot see doubt. They need a rock in this maelstrom.

You meet Jansen's gaze, forcing your voice steady and loud over the storm's fury. "Mr. Jansen! Get the men to batten down the hatches! Secure any loose cargo on deck! Helmsman!" You turn to the young man white-knuckled at the wheel. "Lay her course steady! Steady as she goes! We run before the wind!"

Another colossal wave looms, its shadow falling over the deck. You brace yourself, shouting, "BRAKE! BRAKE NOW!" The ship surges forward as the wave crashes astern, sending spray high into the air like liquid glass. The deck shudders under your feet. Someone screams.

"Report!" you yell.

"Starboard side taking water, Captain!" Jansen shouts back, coughing from the spray. "Bilge pump's jammed!"

"Clear it! Get every man on those pumps! Bail if you have to!" Your eyes sweep the deck – a tangle of wet limbs, terrified faces, and determined effort. A young sailor stares at you, tears mixing with the rain, clutching a splintered railing. *They need to believe.*

You take a deep, salt-tasting breath, feeling the wood of the wheel thrum under your hands. It's not just about the ship; it's about the fragile thing you're building out here – trust, order, survival. The storm screams its challenge, the sea tries to swallow you whole. But the *Meridian's Hope* is still afloat... for now. And you are her captain.

You plant your feet wider, rain plastering your hair to your forehead, and bellow into the gale, your voice raw but unwavering: **"All hands! To your stations! We will ride this storm! Steady as she goes! STEADY!"** The words feel like anchors thrown into the maelstrom. The crew responds, a surge of renewed effort rippling through them. The battle for survival, fierce and immediate, is joined. The dream is alive, thick with danger, salt, and the indomitable will of a captain in the teeth of the tempest.
