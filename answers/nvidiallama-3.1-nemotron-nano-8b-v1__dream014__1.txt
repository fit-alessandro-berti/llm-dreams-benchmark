**Dream Continuation:**  
You feel twinges of panic as city lights clash, and your polished phone播放器 drones to no reply. Despite the crowd thrusting through neon exeeds, a collective murmur from a nearby group gently pierces the chaos. "Strangers?" someone calls out, their voices tinged with kindness.  

You swallow a knot of fear as ten synchronized steps crunch into rhythm, their hands reaching differently shaped hands, their eyes widening in communal curiosity. A volunteer offers, "You seem shaken."  

You take a deep breath, stammering “Thanks…they’ll help me find my …both a place to rest and a goodbye squeeze.”  

As you step into the caring escort, the strangers fumble papers. “Sir, lady, you’re On The Time?!” Another: “Have you shuffling swift congestion? We’re meme-dreamers—ha!" *The car stretches over pavement chaos, the script refusing to show signs. Their voices murmur a reassuring mix, “Follow us. We’ll help you dig back out.”*  

The city blurs, the strangers’ warmth coaxes confidence back. You smile, feeling inadequate for a moment. “You really do what you say,” you admit. “I never realized helping could help me find myself.”  

When you roll into a small café, the volunteer glances up, smiles kindly, and says, “You should sleep comfortably this night. We’re here whenever you’re lost, too.” Your rooms dart close again—a gratitude laugh bubbles in your throat. *Dream ends.*
