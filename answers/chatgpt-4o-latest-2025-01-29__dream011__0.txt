completely illegible, written in a script you’ve never seen before. Your heart races as you glance around the room, hoping to find someone else in the same predicament, but everyone else is calmly writing their answers. Panic starts to rise in your chest. You flip through the pages, hoping at least one question will make sense, when suddenly the words on the page begin to shift and change before your eyes. Now, instead of questions, the pages contain scenes from your life—moments both familiar and strange.

One page shows you as a child, painting with vivid colors in a sunlit room. Another depicts you standing at the edge of a cliff, overlooking a vast and endless ocean, with a heavy backpack weighing you down. You glance up at the room again, and your classmates have disappeared. The exam proctor, now a tall figure cloaked in shimmering fabric, approaches you. As they lean down, their voice echoes softly in the room: "The answer isn't on the page. It's within you. Choose one path."

You're confused but feel an odd sense of calm. The figure gestures to two doors that have suddenly appeared beside your desk. One door glows warmly, emitting soft laughter and whispers of encouragement. The other is darker, with faint murmurs of challenge and echoes of determination. The pen in your hand becomes heavy, like a key, and you realize you must make a choice. 

Which door do you choose?
