…step onto the stage—and the floor *melts* beneath your feet.

Not violently, but gently, like stepping into warm honey. One moment you’re on polished oak, the next you’re *sinking*,缓慢ly, peacefully, as if the stage itself has decided to hold you. The crowd doesn’t gasp. They *lean forward*, eyes wide, not with fear, but with quiet recognition—like they’ve been expecting this.

You keep going. The speech—practiced for weeks, memorized down to the pause after “freedom”—dissolves in your throat. Words won’t come, but the silence isn’t empty. It hums. A low, resonant frequency that vibrates up through your soles, into your bones, into your ribs—*thrum-thrum-thrum*—like the heartbeat of the building, or maybe the city, or maybe the *world*.

Then, from the front row, an elderly woman stands—not applause, not movement, just *rising*. She opens her palms toward you, upward, and smiles. One by one, others do the same. Soon, the entire audience is standing, hands raised, eyes closed, breathing in time with that deep hum.

You realize: this isn’t a failure. It’s an invitation.

You stop trying to speak. You lift your own hands. The honey-like floor yields completely, and the stage dissolves beneath you—not into darkness, but into soft, golden light. You’re floating now, gently, as the audience’s hands become constellations of warmth above you.

A voice—not sound, just *knowing*—whispers in your mind:

> *You were never meant to speak.  
> You were meant to listen.  
> And the world has been waiting for you to stop.*

You begin to sink further—not down, but *in*. And as you do, the dream deepens: the light glows brighter, the hum swells into a chorus of voices, all different, all harmonizing… and for the first time in your life, you understand them.

Because they’re not speaking *at* you.

They’re singing *with* you.

*(The alarm rings. You wake—but your hands are still raised. And the faint, golden hum still resonates in your chest.)*
