you see dark clouds gathering quickly overhead. The air grows cold and the trees around you begin to rustle as a strong wind picks up. You realize you need to find shelter soon.

As you look around, you notice a small, cozy cabin nestled among the trees not far away. It looks like an ideal place to wait out the storm. You start making your way towards it, but the path becomes increasingly difficult to navigate as the wind gusts harder and rain starts to fall.

Just as you reach the cabin, the door swings open unexpectedly. A kind-looking old woman stands in the doorway, inviting you inside with a warm smile. "Come in, dear," she says. "The storm is fierce tonight. You must be exhausted from your journey."

Inside, the cabin is filled with the comforting smell of wood smoke from the fireplace. Cozy armchairs surround the hearth, and shelves line the walls with books and curious trinkets. The old woman offers you a cup of hot chocolate and invites you to sit by the fire while she prepares a place for you to rest.

As you sip the delicious drink, you feel a sense of peace and comfort wash over you. The storm rages outside, but here, within the safety of the cabin, you feel safe and protected. The old woman shares stories of the forest and its inhabitants, weaving tales that seem almost magical. As the night deepens, she leads you to a comfortable bed in a quiet corner of the cabin.

You drift off to sleep, listening to the sound of the storm outside, feeling grateful for the unexpected kindness and the warmth of the cabin. In your dreams, you continue to explore the magical forest, guided by the wise old woman, discovering new wonders and secrets hidden among the trees.
