...not words at all but small, moving things — sentences that flitted like moths, questions that smelled faintly of rain, questions that hummed in chord progressions. Each one settled on the desk and unfolded itself differently: some became soft, patient hands offering a child a plate; one grew into a humming engine and the smell of hot metal; another split into a garden of slow green verbs that wanted tending. When you leaned in, the letters rearranged into questions you had never been asked in school.

How do you calm a stranger who has lost the only picture of their mother?
If you could teach only one truth for the rest of your life, which would you choose?
Tell the story of a machine that learns to be kind.
Design a room where a person can grieve and be reborn.
List three things you would never build, and why.

When you try to write answers, ink doesn't come out; your hands answer by moving. You cradle the paper like a patient and it grows roots where you place your palm. Each response blooms into a doorway across the room, each labelled not with a job but with a verb — to mend, to make, to persuade, to hold, to solve. The future careers sit at the thresholds, waiting politely for your decision.

You realize the exam isn't testing what you know but what you're willing to become. The proctor at the front of the room is you at every age, watching with an unreadable smile. You could copy an answer and the doorway would mirror someone else's life; you could invent a question and open a door you hadn't seen before.

So you do. You breathe, pick up the pen, and write a single line across the last blank page: Who would I be if I answered with courage? The paper warms, the moth-questions settle into quiet, and the doorway nearest you unfurls — its sign blank, waiting for the name you will give it as you step through.
