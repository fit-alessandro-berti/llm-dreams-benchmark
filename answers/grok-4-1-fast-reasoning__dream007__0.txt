You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **settle it the only way that makes sense in a dream: with a rap battle on the edge of a volcano**.

Your friend crosses their arms, steam rising from the bubbling lava below. "You're wrong, and you know it!" they shout over the rumble.

You grin wildly, the surreal logic of the dream kicking in. Words flow like molten rock:  
*"Yo, we've been tight since the sandbox days,*  
*But this beef? It's just a phase.*  
*You say the pizza's best with pineapple—nah, that's wild,*  
*Plain cheese reigns supreme, straight-up styled!"*

They fire back, rhymes sharp as obsidian:  
*"Pineapple's the king, sweet and tangy twist,*  
*Your boring slice? It don't exist!"*

The volcano pulses with the beat, crowds of shadowy figures cheering from floating islands. You drop the mic (a glowing microphone that materializes in your hand), and suddenly, the argument dissolves into laughter. The lava turns to chocolate fondue, and you both dive in, high-fiving as wings sprout from your backs.

Then, the dream glitches—your alarm blares like a volcano erupting. You wake up smiling, texting your friend: "Pineapple on pizza? Truce?"
