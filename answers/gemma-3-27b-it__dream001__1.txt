You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to **panic, a cold knot tightening in your stomach.** The city isn't like any you've seen before. Buildings twist and curve in impossible angles, constructed from a shimmering, obsidian-like material. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency that vibrates in your teeth. 

I instinctively check my pockets. Nothing. No phone, no address, no even a scrap of paper. Just the clothes on my back – a surprisingly comfortable, though utterly out-of-place, tweed suit. 

Okay, breathe. Think. The meeting… it felt *important*. Crucially important. Like the fate of… something rested on it. But what? And with whom? The details are frustratingly blurry, like trying to grasp smoke.

I decide to ask for help. I spot a figure gliding through the crowd – not walking, *gliding*. They’re tall and slender, draped in flowing, silver fabric, their face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. 

“Excuse me!” I call out, my voice sounding thin and reedy in the city’s hum. The figure pauses, turning slowly. As they turn, I notice they don’t have a face *under* the hat. Just… swirling, iridescent mist.

“Lost, are you?” the figure asks, the voice a chorus of whispers. It doesn’t seem surprised to see me, more…expectant.

“I… I have a meeting. In an hour. I don’t know where to go.”

The figure tilts its head, the mist within the hat swirling faster. “The Obsidian Accord. A weighty gathering. You are expected. But the path… is not straightforward. You must follow the echoes.”

“Echoes?” I repeat, confused.

“Listen. Not with your ears, but with your… remembering. The city remembers for those who have forgotten. Focus on the *feeling* of the meeting. The urgency. The… weight.”

I close my eyes, trying to conjure the feeling. A sense of responsibility, a looming deadline, a feeling of being profoundly unprepared. As I concentrate, a faint, rhythmic pulsing begins to resonate within my chest. And then, a sound. Not a clear sound, but a fragmented echo of a melody, a snippet of conversation, a fleeting image of a… a clock tower?

“There!” I exclaim, opening my eyes. “I think… I think I heard something. A clock tower?”

The figure gestures with a long, slender hand. “Follow the echoes. They will lead you to the Chronarium. The Accord convenes within. But be warned. Time flows differently there. An hour may be a moment, or an eternity.”

And with that, the figure glides away, disappearing into the swirling crowd, leaving me standing alone, listening for the faint, fragmented echoes that will hopefully lead me to my mysterious meeting. I start to walk, following the pulsing in my chest and the whispers of forgotten sounds, the obsidian city looming around me, a labyrinth of impossible architecture and unsettling silence. The clock tower… I have to find the clock tower.
