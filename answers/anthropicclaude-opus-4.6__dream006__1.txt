...feel the weight of their gazes like something physical, pressing against my chest. I open my mouth to speak, and my voice comes out—but it isn't *my* voice. It's deeper, resonant, ancient-sounding, like stones grinding together at the bottom of a river.

The audience doesn't seem to notice. They lean forward in their seats.

I look down at my notes, but the words are swimming—literally swimming—tiny black fish darting across the page, rearranging themselves into sentences I've never written. I read them anyway.

"The ceiling is not what you think it is," I hear myself say.

Everyone looks up. And the ceiling of the auditorium is gone. Instead, there's an open sky, impossibly close, bruised purple and gold, with stars that pulse like heartbeats. A warm wind rolls in carrying the smell of rain on hot pavement and something else—cinnamon, maybe, or old books.

I keep speaking, and with each sentence, the room changes. Vines curl up the walls. The seats become moss-covered stones. The audience's faces begin to glow softly, each one a different color, like lanterns at a festival I attended as a child—or maybe only *dreamed* I attended.

I realize I'm not giving a speech at all. I'm remembering something. Or building something. The words aren't meant to inform—they're meant to *construct*.

And just as I reach the final sentence, I notice one face in the crowd that I recognize—someone I haven't seen in years—and they smile at me as if to say, *yes, this is exactly right*, and I feel a warmth bloom behind my ribs, and I—

—wake up reaching for something I can't name.
