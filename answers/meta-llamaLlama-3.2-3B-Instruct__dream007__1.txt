Wait, I think I'm still awake. This doesn't feel like a dream... Okay, let me continue the scenario in my dream, if that's what it is.

You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to take a break and go for a walk to clear your head. As you walk, the conversation doesn't feel like it's done, and you find yourself thinking about what was said and replaying the argument in your head.

As you turn a corner, you see a beautiful lake in front of you, with a small wooden dock that stretches out into the water. The sun is setting, casting a warm golden light over the scene. Your friend appears on the dock, and you walk out to join them, the argument momentarily forgotten.

But just as you're about to talk, a strange thing happens. The lake begins to ripple and churn, and a small boat appears out of the water. It's an old, weathered wooden boat, with a single rower standing at the oars. The rower looks up and catches your eye, and you feel a sense of recognition, as if you've seen them before.

Your friend notices the boat too, and they both turn to you with a mixture of curiosity and concern. "What is that?" your friend asks, their voice barely above a whisper.

The rower begins to row, and the boat glides across the lake, leaving a trail of ripples behind it. As it approaches the shore, you feel a sense of calm wash over you, and the argument from earlier seems to fade away.

The rower pulls up alongside the dock, and a figure jumps out of the boat. It's a younger version of your friend, with the same bright smile and sparkling eyes. But this version is standing on the dock, looking at you with a curious expression.

"What's going on?" you ask, feeling a sense of confusion and wonder.

Your friend turns to you, and their expression is serious. "I think we're just starting to see things," they say. "Things that have been hidden beneath the surface for a long time."

The younger version of your friend takes a step forward, and you feel a sense of recognition, as if you're seeing a part of yourself that you'd forgotten. "Come on," they say. "Let's go for a swim."
