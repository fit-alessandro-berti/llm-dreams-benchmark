Here’s how your dream unfolds:

You’re sitting at your desk in your workplace when an email pings into your inbox. It’s a project brief with a jaw-dropping demand: redesign the entire company website from scratch, and the deadline is tomorrow morning. Your heart kicks into overdrive, thumping loudly in your chest, and a clammy sweat beads on your forehead. Your boss looms nearby, arms crossed, his eyes fixed on you, waiting for you to spring into action. You glance around for support, but the office is eerily empty—your colleagues have vanished without a trace.

Determined to reason your way out, you stand and march toward your boss’s office. But when you push the door open, the familiar room is gone. Instead, you step into a cavernous warehouse, its walls stretching endlessly into shadows. Your boss stands in the center, surrounded by teetering stacks of ancient computers and snarls of tangled wires. He looks at you, his expression unchanging, and says, “Well, what are you waiting for?” You open your mouth to argue that the deadline is insane, but your voice emerges as a feeble whisper, swallowed by the vast space. He doesn’t react, just repeats, “Time is ticking,” his words echoing.

Suddenly, water begins seeping up through the floorboards, cold and relentless. Panic surges as you realize the only way to stop the flood is to start the project. You snatch a dusty laptop from a shelf and flip it open, fingers flying across the keys—but the keys are soft, like jelly, and your hands sink into them, slowing your every move. The water climbs higher, lapping at your knees, then your waist. A massive clock looms on the wall, its hands spinning chaotically, mocking your efforts. You know you have to finish before the flood consumes you.

The water reaches your neck, icy and suffocating. With a final, desperate burst of energy, you slam the “save” button. Instantly, the flood recedes, draining away as if it never existed. The warehouse dissolves, and you’re back in your office. Your boss is there, smiling faintly. “Good job,” he says. “You made it just in time.” Relief washes over you, but your heart still pounds.

Then you wake up, tangled in your sheets, the dream’s stress lingering like a shadow as you catch your breath. It was only a dream—but it felt all too real.
