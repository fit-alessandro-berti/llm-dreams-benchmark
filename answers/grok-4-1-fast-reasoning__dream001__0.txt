You start to panic, your heart racing like a trapped bird as you spin in circles, the city's skyscrapers twisting upward into an endless sky painted in swirling purples and golds. Neon signs flicker in languages you half-recognize—hieroglyphs mixed with emoji—promising "Meetings This Way" but pointing in every direction at once.

You hail a taxi, but the driver is a giant talking owl with glowing eyes, who nods sagely and says, "The meeting is where the clock forgets time." The cab lifts off the ground, soaring between buildings that fold like origami, and you clutch the seat as streets below turn to rivers of liquid starlight.

Suddenly, you're at the meeting—a grand hall of floating crystal tables. But everyone's a version of yourself: one in a suit made of clouds, another playing chess with shadows. "You're late," they chorus, laughing, "but the meeting started before you dreamed it."

You reach for your notes, only to find your hands are made of sand, slipping away. The room melts into a beach at dawn, waves whispering secrets, and the important meeting? It was just the tide coming in, pulling you under into peaceful sleep.

You wake up, groggy, with sand in your shoes and a vague sense of relief. What a weird dream.
