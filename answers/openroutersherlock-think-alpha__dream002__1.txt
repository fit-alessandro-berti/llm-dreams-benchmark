You feel a storm approaching and the sky cracks open like a shattered eggshell, spilling rivers of electric blue lightning that dances between the ancient oaks. The wind howls your name, whipping leaves into swirling vortexes that form faces—whispering secrets of forgotten worlds. Rain begins to fall, but it's not water; it's liquid starlight, warm and tingling against your skin, making the forest glow with an otherworldly luminescence.

You run, heart pounding with exhilaration rather than fear, as the ground beneath you shifts. Roots erupt like serpents, coiling playfully around your ankles, guiding you deeper into a hidden glade where the storm converges. At the center stands a colossal tree, its bark etched with glowing runes that pulse in time with your breath. Thunder booms a laughter that shakes your bones, and from the canopy descends a figure—half deer, half woman, with antlers woven from storm clouds and eyes like twin galaxies.

She extends a hand. "Dance with the tempest," she murmurs, her voice the rumble of waves on cosmic shores. You take it, and the world spins into chaos: trees become towers of emerald fire, animals morph into winged companions that soar beside you, and you leap through portals of rain, tasting freedom in every drop.

The storm peaks in a symphony of light and fury, lifting you skyward on currents of pure dreamstuff. Colors explode—violets bleeding into golds, shadows singing arias. Then, gently, it fades. The forest reclaims its peace, the sky clears to a velvet night speckled with fireflies that wink like knowing stars.

You awaken on your bed, the echo of thunder still thrumming in your chest, a single glowing leaf resting on your pillow. The dream lingers, inviting you back whenever you close your eyes.
