As you approach the blank canvas, it shimmers faintly, as if breathing. The kaleidoscope of colors swirling around it seem drawn to its surface, like moths to a flame. Tentatively, you reach out, and the moment your fingertips graze the canvas, it ripples like water.  

A burst of indigo bleeds into the frame, followed by swirling gold tendrils that twist into the silhouette of a tree. Its branches grow in real time, sprouting leaves that detach and float into the air, dissolving into the dreamscape around you. Suddenly, the ground beneath your feet softens—you look down to find grass, luminous and glowing, spreading outward from the canvas.  

The tree’s trunk splits open, revealing a doorway filled with starlight. A voice—neither yours nor entirely foreign—whispers, *“What else do you see?”* You blink, and the canvas is blank again, but now it hums with potential. As you trace a shape in the air, a coral-red bird erupts from the white space, soaring into a sky that wasn’t there a moment ago.  

The world reshapes itself with every thought, every flicker of feeling—angry zigzags morph into jagged mountains, a sigh melts the horizon into watercolor waves. You realize the canvas isn’t just a tool. It’s a mirror, a compass, a key.  

And then, somewhere in the haze, you notice your own reflection staring back from the canvas—except your eyes are galaxies, and your skin pulses with the same chromatic rhythm as the world around you.  

The dream deepens.
