As you approach the blank canvas, it hums with potential, its surface shimmering like liquid glass. Without thinking, you reach out and touch it—and suddenly, your fingertips dissolve into the canvas, becoming part of the scene. The world around you shifts in response: the sky bleeds into hues of molten gold and violet, while the ground beneath your feet sprout geometric patterns that pulse in rhythm with your heartbeat.

From the corners of the canvas, shadowy figures emerge—half-formed creatures made of brushstrokes and memory. One whispers in a voice like wind through paper: *"What will you paint into existence?"*

You hesitate, then pluck a color from the air—a shade of blue that doesn’t exist in your waking world—and drag it across the canvas. The line you draw curls off into the distance, becoming a river that winds through the landscape. The shapes around you ripple, rearranging themselves into bridges, trees, and distant spires as if the world itself is being rewritten by your hand.

But then, from the depths of the canvas, something stirs. A figure—a silhouette with hollow eyes—steps forward. It points to a corner of the canvas that’s fraying, peeling away like old wallpaper. Beyond it, you glimpse another world, one where the rules of color and form are even stranger.

Do you follow the fraying edge, or do you paint over it before it unravels completely?

*(What happens next?)*
