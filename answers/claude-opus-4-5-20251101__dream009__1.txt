*blinks awake slowly, feeling rough wool against my skin*

...I need to **find water.**

The thirst hits me first—dry, insistent. I'm lying on a straw pallet in what appears to be a small timber-framed structure. Through gaps in the wooden shutters, pale morning light streams in, carrying the smell of woodsmoke and something earthier. Livestock, maybe.

I sit up carefully. My clothes are wrong—or rather, they're *right* for wherever this is. A simple linen tunic. My hands look the same, but feel rougher somehow.

Outside, I hear the creak of a cart wheel, voices speaking in something that sounds almost like English but tilted, the vowels shifted in unfamiliar ways.

*Medieval? Earlier?*

I know I need to:
- Find that water source (follow the sounds of people—settlements cluster near water)
- **Listen before I speak**—my accent, my words, could mark me as dangerously foreign
- Figure out the local power structure before I accidentally offend someone who could have me killed
- Find a useful skill I can trade—can I remember anything about herbal remedies? Arithmetic? 

A church bell rings in the distance. Seven times.

I take a breath and push open the door, stepping into a muddy lane where a woman carrying a basket stops and stares at me with curious, wary eyes.

*What do I say?*
