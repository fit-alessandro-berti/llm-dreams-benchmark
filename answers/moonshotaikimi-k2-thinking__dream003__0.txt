...symbols that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them. You trace a spiral with your fingertip, and the wood—or is it bone?—feels warm, almost breathing. The patterns begin to glow faintly, pulsing in rhythm with your own heartbeat, which you suddenly realize you can't hear anymore.

The box has no seams. No hinges. Just a solid mass of moving symbols. As you hold it, you notice your fingerprints are appearing on its surface, but they're not the ones you were born with—they're loops and whorls you've never seen, belonging to someone older, someone who has touched this box before in a memory that hasn't happened yet.

A sound emerges: not from the box, but from inside your own skull. A humming that vibrates through your teeth. The patterns resolve into a map—not of any place, but of a moment. A specific instant in time where you are standing, right now, holding this box, in a room that doesn't exist yet. 

The key, you understand with dream-certainty, is the thing you're not thinking about. The box opens with the weight of a forgotten name, the taste of a color you've never seen, the exact number of times your childhood cat blinked on the morning it disappeared. You reach for that memory—the one you've been avoiding—and the box's surface becomes liquid. Your hand passes through.

Inside, there's only a mirror. And in the mirror, you're not holding a box at all. You're holding your own head, and the intricate patterns are carved into the bone, glowing softly through the thin places where thought shines out. You try to scream, but the box swallows the sound and uses it to lock itself again.

You wake up holding a small, ordinary wooden block. But your fingerprints are still wrong.
