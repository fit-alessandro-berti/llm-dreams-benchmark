Despite the hardships, you decide to plant a garden. Not just any garden—a defiant riot of green against the cracked earth, where rusted rebar pokes through like the bones of forgotten skyscrapers. Your hands, callused and streaked with the ash of yesterday's scavenging, dig into the soil with a makeshift trowel forged from a hubcap. The sun hangs low, a bloated orange orb mocking the scarcity below, and in the distance, the howls of the pack-rats echo like a bad memory you can't quite shake.

You remember the seeds from your dream-within-a-dream: a crumpled packet of cherry tomatoes pilfered from an abandoned greenhouse, their label faded to whispers of "Heirloom" and "Resilient." Water? That's the cruel joke. You've rigged a rainwater trap from tarps and scavenged gutters, but the skies have been stingy, dribbling just enough to tease hope. As you pat the dirt over the first sprout, a shadow flickers at the edge of your vision—a lone figure in a hooded duster, silhouetted against the crumbling overpass. Raider? Survivor? Or just the wind playing tricks on your frayed nerves?

You call out, voice hoarse from disuse: "Hey! You got a light? Or maybe... some company?" The figure pauses, then approaches with the deliberate gait of someone who's weighed every step since the world ended. It's a woman, her face half-hidden by a scarf woven from old maps, eyes sharp as shrapnel. "Garden, huh?" she says, crouching beside you, her gloved fingers brushing the soil. "Bold move. Last one I saw got trampled by ferals. But... I've got news. There's a convoy heading north at dawn. Rumors of clean water. Real soil. A place where things grow without fighting for it."

Your heart thuds, a mix of thrill and terror. Join her? Risk the wastes for a whisper of paradise? Or stay, nurture this fragile patch of rebellion, and dare the world to try and take it? The pack-rats howl closer now, and the first stars prick the bruised sky like hesitant allies. In the dream, choices feel infinite, but the ground beneath you trembles faintly—a reminder that even in reverie, nothing's promised.

What do you do next? The dream bends to your will... for now.
