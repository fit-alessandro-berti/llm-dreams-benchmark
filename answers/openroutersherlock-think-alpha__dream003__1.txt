symbols that seem to writhe like living vines under your fingertips. The patterns pulse with an otherworldly light, shifting from crimson to sapphire, whispering secrets in a language you almost understand—echoes of forgotten lullabies from your childhood.

Drawn irresistibly, you trace one spiraling rune, and the box hums to life. A soft click echoes through the dreamscape, and the lid creaks open on its own, revealing not gold or jewels, but a swirling nebula of stars contained within, miniature galaxies birthing and dying in endless cycles.

You reach in, your hand passing through the void like mist, and pull out a flawless mirror. Your reflection stares back—not your waking self, but a luminous version of you, wings of iridescent feathers unfurling from your shoulders. "The key was always you," it whispers, voice harmonizing with the box's hum.

The dream fractures then, the box dissolving into fireflies that lift you skyward. You soar over endless oceans of cloud and dream, the mirror clutched tight, until the first light of dawn pulls you gently awake, the patterns lingering faintly on your skin.
