…walk to the podium. Your notes are waiting, but when you glance down, the words are shimmering like water, impossible to read. The expectant silence grows louder, a physical pressure in your ears. You clear your throat, and the microphone amplifies it into a sound like a landslide.

You open your mouth to speak, but your opening line has vanished. Instead, you hear a faint, familiar melody—a lullaby from childhood, played on a distant piano. The audience doesn’t seem to notice. They are still waiting, their faces kind and patient.

You take a deep breath, deciding to speak from the heart instead of the vanished text. As the first word leaves your lips, you realize you are not speaking at all. You are singing the lullaby. Your voice, clear and strong, fills the auditorium. And one by one, the members of the audience begin to softly hum along, their eyes closed, a thousand people remembering the same forgotten dream. The stage beneath your feet feels like soft grass. The ceiling above dissolves into a sky full of stars. You are no longer giving a speech. You are leading a chorus into the quiet, beautiful night.
