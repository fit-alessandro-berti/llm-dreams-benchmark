You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you gratefully accept, following them through neon-lit alleys that twist like veins of light. Their faces shimmer, half-familiar—echoes of old friends, perhaps?—as they lead you to a hidden rooftop garden blooming impossibly with starlit flowers. Laughter bubbles up, warm and weightless, dissolving your solitude into a shared feast of glowing fruits that taste like forgotten memories. But as the city skyline warps into swirling galaxies below, one stranger whispers, "This way home isn't straight," and you leap into the dream's embrace, soaring weightless toward a dawn that tastes like cinnamon and possibility. Then, the edges blur... and you wake, heart racing, with the faint echo of their voices lingering like morning mist.
