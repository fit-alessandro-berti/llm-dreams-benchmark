...find that your computer has been replaced by a typewriter made of melting ice. The keys are cold to the touch, and the paper is a frozen sheet that cracks every time you try to type a letter.

Your boss stands behind you, wearing a suit made of loud ticking clocks, and he says, "We need this done by the time the ice melts. The clients are watching." You look over your shoulder and see the clients are actually shadowy silhouettes standing in the corner, holding umbrellas that are dripping black rain onto the carpet, which is turning into a swamp.

You try to type, but your fingers stick to the ice keys. Every time you pull one free, it makes a sound like a scream. The cursor on the screen—which is now just a mirror reflecting your own panicked face—starts to bleed digital tears. The deadline counter above the door isn't counting down minutes; it's counting down the years of your life, and the number is dropping rapidly.

You open your mouth to ask for an extension, but instead of words, small moths fly out. Your boss nods solemnly and hands you a cup of coffee that is boiling over with sand. "Drink," he says. "It fuels the urgency."

You wake up just as the typewriter collapses into a puddle and the moths begin to eat the shadows.
