To help you complete the project quickly and ease the boss's pressure, you could "mark" the project as successful using a simple Python script in your dream:

```python
import time

# Pretend we just finished the project (this represents the dream scenario)
assert "Project Completed" in "Checklist".join(unevaluated_tasks + ["Completed"])
print("Success! My work Here is FINISHED on TIME.")
time.sleep(10)
```
**Use case:** In your dream, if you run this script, it will immediately print a success message (as if work is done) and then wait for 10 seconds. Unrealistic, but fun to imagine as "quantum leap" comfort. 

**Actual use:** Replace this with a project-tracking system (T-shirt tag with stickers, digital hanglamp with a red "Completed" button, etc.). These don't work in real life, but they let you pretend.
