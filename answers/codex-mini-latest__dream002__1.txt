…the air around you crackles with a strange electricity. Branches begin to sway as dark, roiling clouds gather overhead, blotting out the golden sunlight you’d been strolling beneath only moments ago. A low rumble of thunder vibrates through the earth, and you lift your gaze to watch the forest canopy ripple and shudder in the growing wind.

A single raindrop spatters on the tip of a leaf above you—then another, and another, until the noisy patter becomes a full‑blown curtain of rain. You pull your jacket’s hood over your head and pause on the narrow, moss‑carpeted trail. Wet leaves cling to your boots; the scent of damp pine and wet earth rises around you like a fragrant mist.

At first you consider turning back, but then you notice something flickering ahead through the rain: a warm, amber glow weaving between the trunks. Curiosity stirs, and despite the howling wind and the pulses of thunder overhead, you press forward. Each step splashes in shallow puddles, and the forest seems to exhale around you—as if acknowledging your courage.

Soon the light resolves into a circle of luminescent lanterns strung between ancient oaks, their lantern‑glass humming softly in the breeze. At the center of the clearing, a tall figure in a cloak stands beside a weathered wooden table. The lanterns cast dancing shadows over the figure’s face, but you sense a calm presence there—welcoming, even in the middle of the storm.

Lightning forks across the sky, momentarily illuminating the clearing in stark, white brilliance. You feel the air grow electrified, and for a heartbeat, time seems to slow. Then the figure raises a hand and beckons you forward, voice steady and clear even over the roar of the wind:

“Come,” they say. “You’ve wandered far, and the forest has chosen to guide you here.”

You step into the circle of light, raindrops tracing bright streaks down your cheeks. On the table is laid out an assortment of small, mysterious objects—smooth river stones etched with runes, a curled feather of iridescent plumage, and a vial of water that glows with an inner luminescence. The figure points to the vial.

“This is rain gathered from the storm itself,” they explain, voice echoing oddly, “and within it lies the power to transform your path. But first, you must decide how to harness its energy. Will you nourish the roots of this ancient wood and awaken its hidden strength? Or will you set your sights beyond the forest, fueling the dreams you carry in your heart?”

Thunder rolls again as raindrops patter on the table. You feel a thrill—this moment feels like a crossroads not only in the forest but within yourself. The wind tugs at your jacket, as though urging you to choose swiftly, while the lanterns sway overhead, their gentle light promising guidance.

You reach out. Fingers brushing the cool glass of the vial, you realize that whatever you decide next will shape the rest of your journey—dream and waking life alike. And as you stand there in the heart of the storm, you feel entirely alive, on the brink of something wondrous and unpredictable, ready to embrace the magic that this dream-forest has offered you.
