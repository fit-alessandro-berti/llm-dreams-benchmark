…a faint, rhythmic pulse beneath the polished mahogany, like a tiny heart made of glass.  

You run your fingers along the seams, and each ridge you press—clockwise, counter-clockwise, in sequences of three, four, seven—changes the pitch of the pulsing. A hidden music begins to play, low at first, then rising into a lullaby you half-remember from a childhood that never was.  

The lid eases open on its own, light spilling out in ribbons of color that taste like citrus and sound like laughter. Inside lies not gold or jewels, but a single snowflake caught in a drop of amber. As you reach for it, the snowflake unravels into a slip of parchment that reads:  

“Unfold me, and the sky will fold you.”  

You hesitate. The box begins to hum, deeper and deeper, until your bones vibrate in answer. Your reflection in the lid starts to speak without moving its lips, repeating the warning: “Unfold me, and the sky will fold you.”
