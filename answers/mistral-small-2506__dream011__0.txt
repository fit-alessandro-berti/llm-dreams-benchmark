**Dream Continuation:**

As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language you’ve never seen before—twisted symbols and looping script that seem to shift when you blink. The room grows colder, and the air hums with an eerie static. The other students around you are writing furiously, but their faces are blank, their hands moving as if controlled by invisible strings.

You glance at the clock—it’s counting down, but the numbers are wrong. The hands spin backward, and the digits melt into liquid silver. A whisper slithers through the air: *"You already know the answers."*

Your pencil hovers over the paper. When you press it down, the page ripples like water, and the symbols rearrange themselves into a single, glowing question:

**"What do you fear most?"**

The room vanishes. You’re standing in a vast, empty library, shelves stretching into darkness. A book on a pedestal opens itself, revealing a mirror instead of pages. Your reflection stares back—but it’s not quite you. It smiles, and the voice whispers again:

*"Choose."*

Do you answer the question? Do you run? Or do you wake up—only to realize the exam was never real… but the fear was?

*(Would you like to explore a specific direction for the dream?)*
