# The Dream

You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are **written in a language that shifts every time you blink.**

At first, it looks like English — but the letters rearrange themselves, slithering across the page like living things. You catch fragments: *"Define the weight of an unfinished thought"* and *"Calculate the distance between who you are and who you pretend to be."*

Your pencil feels impossibly heavy.

You glance around. The other students are writing furiously, confidently, their pens scratching in perfect rhythm, like a heartbeat. Nobody else seems troubled. The girl next to you has already filled three pages with luminous silver ink you're certain didn't come from any pen.

You look back at your paper. The questions have changed again:

**Question 1:** *Draw a map of every choice you've ever avoided.*

**Question 2:** *Who will you disappoint?*

**Question 3:** *This question is watching you.*

The clock on the wall has no numbers — just a single hand spinning backward. The professor at the front of the room is your mother. No — your childhood self. No — a mirror, reflecting someone older than you are now, mouthing words you can't hear.

Your pencil finally touches the page, and instead of graphite, it leaves a trail of light. You begin to write, and somehow — impossibly — **you know every answer.** But the moment you try to read what you've written, you realize the words are meant for someone you haven't become yet.

The bell rings.

You wake up.

And for just a moment, you can still feel the pencil's warmth in your hand.
