...written in a language you don't understand. Panic starts to rise in you as you realize you've been studying in a foreign language all semester. You scan the room, but no one else seems to be having this problem. You look at the clock - you only have 10 minutes left to start the exam. What do you do?

1. You decide to try and ask the professor for help, but you're not sure if they speak your language.
2. You try to remember any familiar words or phrases in the language, hoping to decipher the questions.
3. You decide to wing it, guessing answers based on what you think you know about the topic.
4. You decide to take a deep breath and try to calm down, hoping that your panic won't cloud your judgment.
5. You decide to change your seating position, hoping that might somehow change the dream or help you see things differently.
