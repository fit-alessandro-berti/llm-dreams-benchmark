You stare at the stack of papers your boss thrusts into your hands—blueprints for a machine that defies physics, something that looks like a coffee maker crossed with a time machine and a flock of origami birds. "Due by lunch," she says, her voice echoing like it's coming from the bottom of a well. Lunch? It's already 3 a.m. in dream time, and the clock on the wall is melting like a Salvador Dalí fever dream, its hands spinning backward while ticking forward in Morse code: *hurry up hurry up*.

You sit down at your desk, which suddenly sprouts legs and starts tap-dancing across the office floor. The keyboard under your fingers turns to jelly, keys squelching out nonsense words—"quantum flan" and "regret.exe"—as you type furiously. Emails flood in from alternate universes: one from your future self warning you not to eat the stapler, another from a client who's actually a sentient spreadsheet demanding revisions in haiku form.

Your boss hovers nearby, her face morphing into a giant hourglass, sand pouring from her eyes. "Progress?" she demands, and in panic, you blurt out the first thing that comes to mind: "It's alive!" Because it is—the project file on your screen has grown tentacles and is slithering toward the printer, birthing copies of itself in neon ink. The office erupts into chaos: colleagues morph into squirrels hoarding USB drives, the vending machine belches confetti laced with deadlines, and the ceiling rains Post-it notes with your childhood fears scrawled in crayon.

You grab a tentacle, wrestle it back into the code, and hit "compile." The machine hums to life, whirring like a choir of malfunctioning dial-up modems. Lights flicker; the room tilts 45 degrees. And then—poof—it's done. Not just done, but *extraordinarily* done. The machine brews perfect coffee that tastes like success, folds time into neat pleats so you can redo yesterday's regrets, and launches a thousand paper cranes into the sky, each carrying a tiny "A+".

Your boss claps—slow, thunderous applause that shakes the foundations—and transforms into a flock of golden geese, honking approval as they soar away. The office dissolves into a beach at dawn, waves lapping at your feet, the impossible project now a sandcastle you kick over with a laugh. You wake up tangled in sheets, the alarm blaring like a victory fanfare, and for a split second, you swear you smell coffee.
