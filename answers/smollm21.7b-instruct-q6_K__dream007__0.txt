Suddenly, there's a knock on the door. I rush towards it expecting it might be mine, but when I open it, I find out it belongs to my neighbor, frantically shaking from fear. She whispers urgently in my ear... "It was outside before you found this house! It sounded like shattering glass coming from your yard!" 

Now the tension is palpable as both you and your friend are staring at her, demanding answers about who or what could have been causing such noise around your shared property line.
