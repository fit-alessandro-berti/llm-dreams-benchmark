In the vast, unfamiliar city, you take a deep breath and decide to ask for directions. You spot a bustling street market nearby and approach a friendly-looking vendor who speaks English. You explain your situation, and the vendor smiles warmly.

"Ah, I can help you," they say. "The meeting is at the Grand Central Plaza. It's a grand building with a clock tower. You can't miss it. Just follow the main avenue, and it's straight ahead."

You thank the vendor and set off, following the main avenue. The city is a mix of old and new, with towering skyscrapers and narrow, winding streets. You pass by people from all walks of life, each with their own unique attire and expressions.

As you walk, you notice that the city is filled with a strange, ethereal glow. The buildings seem to shimmer in the light, and the air is filled with a soft, melodic hum. You feel a sense of peace and wonder, as if you've stepped into a dream within a dream.

After what feels like an eternity, you finally arrive at the Grand Central Plaza. The building is indeed grand, with a massive clock tower that casts long, dancing shadows. You enter through the ornate doors and are greeted by a grand lobby filled with people in elegant attire.

You spot a sign with your name on it and make your way to the designated room. As you enter, you see that the meeting has already started. You take a seat and listen intently as the others discuss the agenda. You feel a sense of relief and accomplishment, knowing that you've navigated this unfamiliar city and made it to your meeting on time.

As the meeting wraps up, you thank your colleagues for their patience and leave the building. You take one last look at the Grand Central Plaza, feeling grateful for the strange and wonderful experience. You know that this dream will stay with you, a reminder of the magic that can be found in the most unexpected of places.
