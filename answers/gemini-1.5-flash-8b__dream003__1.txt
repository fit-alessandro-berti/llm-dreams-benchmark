You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and swirling symbols etched into the surface, resembling constellations, but impossible ones.  They pulsed with a faint, inner light, shifting and reforming in a hypnotic rhythm.  A faint, metallic scent, like polished obsidian, emanated from the box.  Touching a particular symbol, a tiny, almost invisible glyph nestled between two larger ones, a whisper, not of sound, but of feeling, vibrated through your fingertips.  It seemed to be a question, a plea, a demand.  "Unlock me."

The box, seemingly solid, began to shimmer, a series of iridescent facets unfolding like a flower.  A subtle hum filled the air, resonating in your chest.  You realized the box wasn't an object, but a portal, a gateway to another dimension, or perhaps another time.  Within the opening, you saw a swirling vortex of colours; indigo, amethyst, and emerald, intertwining with each other.  And in the centre, a figure stood, draped in shimmering fabrics that flowed like liquid light.  They weren't human, not quite.  Their form was fluid, like smoke coalescing into shape, their eyes, glowing embers, fixated on you.

They reached out a hand, not of flesh and bone, but of constellations themselves, the intricate patterns mirroring those etched on the box.  A voice, not of words, but of thoughts and emotions, resonated in your mind.  "The key," it whispered, "is not found, it is *remembered*."  The image of the face faded, the vortex tightened, and the box closed again, but not with a snap, but with a gentle sigh, returning to its former, seemingly solid form.  You were left alone, the scent of obsidian lingering in the air.  You felt a surge of understanding, a sudden recall of a forgotten dream, a whispered secret from a past life.  You knew, with absolute certainty, that the answer, the key to unlocking the box, wasn't to be found in some tangible place, but within the depths of your own memory.
