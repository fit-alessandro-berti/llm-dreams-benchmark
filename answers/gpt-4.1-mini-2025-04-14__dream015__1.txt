explore the remnants of a once-thriving city. As you navigate through crumbling buildings and overgrown streets, you spot a faint glimmer of light flickering in the distance. Curiosity pushes you forward, and as you approach, you discover a small group of survivors huddled around a campfire. They welcome you cautiously, and together you share stories and resources, forming the fragile beginning of a new community. Amidst the ruins, hope starts to bloom once again.
