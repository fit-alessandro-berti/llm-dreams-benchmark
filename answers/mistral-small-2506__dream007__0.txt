walk away. The air between you feels thick with unspoken words, and the weight of the argument lingers like a storm cloud. As you turn to leave, the world around you begins to shift—colors bleed into one another, and the ground beneath your feet feels unstable, as if reality itself is softening at the edges.

Suddenly, you realize you’re no longer in the place where the argument happened. The streets have melted into a vast, shimmering desert, the sand glowing faintly under an impossible twin sun. Your friend is nowhere to be seen, but their voice echoes in the distance, distorted and distant, as if calling from another dream.

You start walking, unsure of where you’re going, but the desert stretches endlessly in all directions. The heat is oppressive, yet you don’t feel it—your body moves as if through water, slow and dreamlike. Then, you notice something strange: footprints in the sand, leading away from you. They’re not yours. They’re too large, too deep, as if someone—or something—much bigger has passed this way.

As you follow them, the landscape changes again. The desert gives way to a dense, whispering forest, the trees towering and ancient. The footprints lead to a clearing where a figure stands, their back turned to you. It’s your friend, but something is wrong. Their silhouette is too tall, too still, as if they’re not quite real.

When they turn, their face is smooth and featureless, like a mask of polished stone. Their voice, when it speaks, is layered with echoes, as if multiple versions of them are speaking at once.

*"You walked away,"* they say. *"But you can’t outrun this."*

The dream twists again. The forest vanishes, and you’re standing on the edge of a cliff, the wind howling around you. Below, an endless abyss swirls with colors and shapes—memories, maybe, or fears. Your friend’s voice is gone, but their words linger in your mind.

You take a step forward. The ground crumbles beneath you.

And then—

You wake up.

Your heart is pounding, your sheets tangled around your legs. The argument from your dream still feels raw, but the details are already slipping away, like sand through your fingers. Was it real? Or just another layer of the dream?

You reach for your phone, half-expecting a message from your friend. The screen is blank.

But as you set it down, you notice something strange—a single, large footprint in the dust on your nightstand. Too big to be yours.

And the dream isn’t over yet.
