You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in hieroglyphics that shimmer and shift like liquid gold on the page. You blink hard, thinking it's just nerves, but when you look again, the symbols start dancing off the paper, forming tiny figures that march across your desk like an army of animated stick people.

Panic surges through you. This exam is everything—your dream job as a quantum physicist hangs in the balance. You've studied for months, memorizing equations and theories, but none of that prepared you for this. The first question morphs into a riddle: "If a black hole swallows a star, what color is the echo?" You stare, dumbfounded, and try to scribble an answer, but your pencil turns into a wriggling snake that slithers away, leaving ink trails that spell out "WRONG" in looping cursive.

The room around you begins to warp. The other students fade into shadows, their faces melting like wax candles, and the proctor at the front—wait, is that your childhood teddy bear wearing a mortarboard? It growls, "Time's ticking, dreamer," in a voice that sounds suspiciously like your old high school principal mixed with a cartoon villain.

Desperate, you flip the page, only to find the next question is a mirror reflecting your own face, but older, with wrinkles and a beard you don't have. It asks, "Who will you become if you fail?" You reach out to touch it, and suddenly you're pulled inside the paper, tumbling through a vortex of floating equations and forgotten homework assignments from grade school.

Inside this paper world, you land in a vast library where books fly like birds, and the shelves stretch into infinity. A wise old owl perches on a podium and hoots, "The real test is not in answers, but in questions unasked." You chase after a fluttering page that might hold the key, but it leads you to a door labeled "Exit Exam." Pushing it open, you step into... your own bedroom?

The alarm clock blares, jolting you awake. Heart pounding, you sit up in bed, drenched in sweat. It was just a dream. But as you glance at your nightstand, there's a single sheet of paper with a hieroglyph scrawled on it, glowing faintly in the dawn light. Was it? You shake your head, laughing it off—dreams are weird like that. Time to get ready for the real exam. Or is it?
