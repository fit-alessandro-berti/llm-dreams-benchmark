...climb the skeleton of the tallest skyscraper, a rusted needle piercing the bruised, heavy clouds.

You aren't climbing to scavenge or to hide. You are climbing because you are carrying a violin case that feels heavier than it should, as if it contains the weight of history.

The wind howls through the exposed girders, smelling of ozone and wet ash. Below you, the shadows of things that hunt in the dark are prowling the streets, but they cannot reach you here.

When you finally pull yourself onto the roof, the world stretches out in a panorama of gray ruin. You open the case. Inside isn't an instrument, but a collection of captured storms—swirling miniature clouds trapped in glass jars.

You pick up the jar labeled *“Spring Rain”* and smash it against the concrete.

Because this is a dream, the water doesn't just wet the ground; it rewrites it. Moss erupts instantly from the impact site, racing across the roof in a vibrant, impossible green. Vines shoot up from the dead steel, blooming with bioluminescent flowers that hum with the sound of bees that no longer exist.

You continue to break the jars. You release *“Golden Hour Sunlight”* and *“Quiet Sunday Morning.”*

The apocalypse doesn't end with a battle, but with a garden. The gray city below begins to be consumed by aggressive, beautiful life, flowing down the side of the building like a waterfall of ivy and light. You sit on the edge of the roof, dangling your feet over the new world you are making, watching the ruins turn into a forest.
