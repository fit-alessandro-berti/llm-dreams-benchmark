You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around.  Cobblestones, surprisingly clean, pave the narrow streets.  The air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and roasting meat, hums with a low, rhythmic chanting.  You're dressed in…well, you're dressed in something.  Roughspun linen, certainly, but it feels oddly familiar despite its unfamiliar cut.  Your head throbs, and the world swirls in a dizzying kaleidoscope of colours you've never seen before.  You stumble, and then catch yourself on a weathered wooden beam.  You realize you're in a bustling marketplace, the chatter a confusing jumble of unfamiliar tongues.  Around you, people are haggling over wares – intricately carved wooden bowls, spices piled high in woven baskets, and fabrics the colour of sunsets.  You're completely disoriented, utterly lost.  You need to…  find out who you are, where you are, and how you got here.  But more urgently, you need to figure out how to survive.  The strange feeling of emptiness in your stomach, the pounding in your head, and the unfamiliar chill in the air, tell you that you haven't eaten in days.  You need to find food, and quickly.
