Certainly. Here's a continuation of the dream:

---

The air between you crackles with unspoken words, thick as storm clouds. Your friend’s face contorts—a mix of fury and sorrow—and in the dream-logic of this moment, their voice begins to echo as if spoken through water. You try to respond, but your throat tightens, each syllable dissolving into a flock of dark birds that scatter across the room. The walls around you warp, stretching into an endless corridor of mirrors, each reflecting fractured versions of your argument: *you, shouting; you, pleading; you, walking away.*  

Suddenly, the ground softens like moss beneath your feet, and the furniture floats upward, defying gravity. A clock on the wall ticks backward, its hands bleeding ink onto the floor. Your friend reaches out, but their fingers dissolve into smoke, reforming as a key. The key drops into your palm, cold and heavy, and in an instant, you’re both standing in a field of tall grass under a twin-moon sky.  

The grass whispers secrets as it bends toward you, and you realize the argument was never about the thing you thought—it was a door, and the key unlocks a memory neither of you dared to share. A childhood house materializes in the distance, its windows glowing amber. You turn to speak, but your friend’s face has softened, their features blurring like watercolor.  

“Wait,” you say, but the wind carries their reply: *“We’re always arguing in circles. Maybe this time, we’ll remember the center.”*  

The ground splits open, not violently, but like a curtain drawing back to reveal a spiral staircase descending into light. You hesitate, then grasp their hand—solid now, warm—their palm pressed to yours like a vow. Together, you step into the glow, and the dream folds inward, a origami crane dissolving into a single feather…  

Then, silence.  

You wake with the taste of salt on your lips, unsure if it’s from tears or the ocean you now swear you heard roaring in the distance.
