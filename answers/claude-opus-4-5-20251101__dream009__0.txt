*blinks awake, feeling rough wool beneath my fingers*

...I need to **find water.**

The thirst hits me first用rimal, undeniable. My lips are cracked. The air smells of woodsmoke and something animal, like livestock nearby.

I sit up slowly. I'm in a low structure, wattle and daub walls, a packed earth floor. Through a small opening, golden light slants in. Dawn or dusk悠 can't tell. Somewhere outside, I hear the rhythmic *chunk* of wood being split.

My modern clothes feel wrong here. Too bright. Too synthetic. Already I understand: I need to blend before I need to eat, before I need shelter, before I need answers.

I step outside.

A village stretches before me葉hatched roofs, chickens pecking in the dirt, a woman carrying an earthenware jug on her hip. She glances at me without recognition but also without alarm. As if I belong here.

In the distance: a river, threading silver through fields of something golden. Barley, maybe. Or wheat.

I start walking toward the water, but I feel it葉hat dream-knowing葉hat something is waiting for me there. Someone. That I didn't arrive in this time by accident.

The woman with the jug watches me pass, and just before I reach the riverbank, she calls out in a language I shouldn't understand but somehow do:

*\'re early. She hasn't risen yet.\

*What happens next?*
