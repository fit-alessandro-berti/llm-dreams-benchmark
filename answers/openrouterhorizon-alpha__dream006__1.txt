…speak, but the words come out as a flock of small paper birds. They flutter from your mouth in a rustling hush, catching the stage lights, and the audience tilts their heads to follow them. You try again, reaching for a sentence you practiced, and instead a single bright ribbon pours from your lips, spelling your first line in cursive midair before dissolving into confetti.

A murmur ripples through the room; it sounds like wind moving through leaves. You glance down at your notes, but the pages are blank except for the faint watermark of your own heartbeat. It drums a rhythm you recognize, and when you look up, the podium has become a narrow pier over a dark, calm lake. The first row of seats is now a shoreline. Someone coughs, and a ring of ripples spreads across the water, gently tapping against your shoes.

You inhale, and the stage inhales with you, wood planks rising and falling like a sleeping animal. Your throat loosens. You decide to tell the truth. You say, I am afraid, and a small boat slides out from your chest and lands with a soft splash. It is sturdy, plain, and the oars are your hands. The audience leans forward as one, not to judge but to listen, and their faces soften into lanterns.

You speak of the time you couldn’t find the right door and learned to knock on the sky instead, and a door appears overhead, opening into a blue that smells like rain on dusty summer streets. You speak of how you carry your childhood in your pocket like a smooth stone, and you feel its cool weight, and some people in the back reach unconsciously for their own pockets. You speak of a voice you almost lost, and your words return as warm breath on frozen glass, drawing a circle you can see through.

The lights shift. Snow begins to fall, but it is slow and glows faintly, and each flake is a letter. They cling to your sleeves, spelling out names of strangers and the names of the trees outside. When you laugh, it echoes from somewhere you stood long ago, and your laugh then and your laugh now braid together like twins meeting midair. The boat drifts along the pier, and without meaning to, you step onto it. The audience steps with you, their chairs becoming lily pads that hold.

You apologize for not being ready, and a thousand hands flutter dismissively, as if shooing a gentle myth. You thank them for their patience, and gratitude spreads like warmth from a cup passed around. Someone in the balcony whispers a question that arrives in your ear as a feather: What are you trying to say? You close your eyes and feel the answer come not as a sentence, but as a door opening inward.

When you open your eyes, your mouth releases not birds this time but a tide. It’s made of ordinary things: the steam from morning tea, the sound of a train slowing, the scrape of a key in a lock that finally turns. The tide carries a single quiet truth to the edge of the stage and lays it there, shining like a wet stone: We are here together, and that matters.

You let the silence after be long enough to be true. In that silence, you realize the crowd is not a crowd at all but a mirror: every face is yours, at different ages, wearing different mistakes and hopes. They are expectant because they already know the speech; they are waiting to hear it from you. You bow your head, and all the mirrors bow back. The paper birds return, folding themselves into your palms. The ribbon ties itself around your wrist, warm as a pulse.

You take a breath and begin again, and this time the words land gently and stay. They do not dazzle. They do not need to. They click into place like stones across a stream, and together you and your many selves walk across them, over the water that is listening, until you reach the other side where the curtain is a horizon, and the applause is rain. You feel it on your face, and you look up, and every drop spells your name correctly, even the one you haven’t chosen yet.

Somewhere behind the lights, a door closes softly. Somewhere in front of you, a door opens with a sound like a page turning. You step through, still speaking, and the audience rises, and the lake becomes a room again, and your note cards fill with writing, and your heart steadies, and the dream remembers you, and you remember it back. And in that overlap—stage and shore, fear and voice—you find the sentence you came to deliver, waiting like a hand extended in the dark, and you take it.
