As you continue walking through the forest, the sky darkens rapidly, and the once gentle rustling of leaves is replaced by a fierce howling wind. The trees around you sway violently, their branches creaking and groaning under the force of the gusts. You can hear the distant rumble of thunder, and the air becomes thick with the scent of rain.

Suddenly, the first drops of rain begin to fall, heavy and cold, splashing against your skin and soaking through your clothes in an instant. The forest, once serene, now feels alive with energy, as if the storm itself is a living entity. Lightning flashes across the sky, illuminating the dark clouds in brief, blinding bursts, and the thunder grows louder, echoing through the trees like a primal drumbeat.

You quicken your pace, seeking shelter, but the path ahead seems to twist and turn in unexpected ways. The rain falls harder, and the wind pushes against you, making each step a challenge. You duck under a large tree, hoping for some respite, but the branches offer little protection from the relentless downpour.

As the storm intensifies, you notice something strange: the forest seems to be changing. The trees appear to shift and morph, their shapes becoming more abstract, almost surreal. The ground beneath your feet feels unstable, as if it might give way at any moment. You realize that this is no ordinary storm—it’s a manifestation of something deeper, something tied to the dream itself.

You take a deep breath, trying to steady yourself, and decide to embrace the chaos. You step out from under the tree, letting the rain wash over you, and begin to run, not away from the storm, but into it. The wind whips around you, and the thunder seems to roar in approval as you surrender to the dream’s wild energy.

And then, just as suddenly as it began, the storm begins to subside. The rain slows to a drizzle, the wind dies down, and the clouds start to part, revealing glimpses of a clear, starry sky. The forest returns to its peaceful state, and you find yourself standing at the edge of a clearing, where a soft, golden light beckons you forward.

You step into the clearing, and the dream begins to fade, leaving you with a sense of calm and a lingering memory of the storm’s raw, untamed beauty.
