The room is surprisingly small compared to the size of my body. I step into it cautiously, hoping that I don't slip or fall out. I turn inward, looking around at the various options before me, mentally rehearsing a series of questions and scenarios to help myself get through this challenging maze in under fifteen minutes.

As if on cue, I see a small opening in the corner behind a tree. My mind racing, I approach the door with greater excitement than caution. The rusty doorknob clicks shut softly, followed by a slight humming noise that seems out of place among all the other sounds in this dimly lit space until my left hand touches the button and it stays there forever.

With renewed determination, I take another step forward. My footfalls hit smooth stone beneath foot as the door opens more smoothly to reveal a warm, cozy room filled with soft lighting. I can hear the faint murmur of voices echoing in the distance and feel the comforting scent of baking cookies wafting on my breath from within the warmth of this bed where I am resting during the night's adventures.

In every step forward, I recall that there are no stairs or elevators present here. My body is capable of navigating most any narrow alleyway without trouble. My eyes scan for the clue that will unlock the room and I begin to move upward, my heart beating in time with the music of a vintage organ drifting softly through this space. With deliberate stooping back and upstretching arms, I step into this small yet well-lit space, feeling the warm glow from the candles casting long shadows upon the walls as I continue my journey through the labyrinth of life.
