You are participating in a competition where the grand prize is your dream job. As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and—suddenly—the rules shift.

The stage dissolves into a forest of floating books, their pages fluttering like wings. Each book contains a memory: your first failed presentation, the midnight panic before your thesis deadline, the quiet moment you cried after being rejected from your dream internship. The judges? They’re not people—they’re echoes of your past selves, each wearing the outfit of a different year, their faces blurred just enough to feel like ghosts you’ve outgrown.

A voice, neither male nor female, hums from the treetops: *“To win, you must not prove you’re the best. You must prove you’re still growing.”*

Your next challenge: walk through the Library of Regrets. Every step you take, one of your fears surfaces—a whisper, a嘲笑, a mirror showing you as a failure. But instead of running, you stop. You open each book. You read the worst part. And then… you write a new ending in your own handwriting.

One page: *“I thought I wasn’t good enough to speak up.”*  
You scribble: *“I spoke anyway. And someone listened.”*

Another: *“I quit when it got hard.”*  
You write: *“I came back. Because I cared.”*

The forest begins to glow. The books rise into the sky, turning into lanterns. The echoes step forward, now clear—their faces are yours, but older. Wiser. Smiling.

One of them hands you a key shaped like a pen.

“You didn’t win the job,” it says.  
“You became the person who deserves it.”

You wake up.

And on your phone, a notification glows:

*“Congratulations. You’ve been selected for the role. Start date: tomorrow. We’d love to hear your story.”*

You smile.

Because now you know—the dream job wasn’t the prize.

It was the courage you finally learned to give yourself.
