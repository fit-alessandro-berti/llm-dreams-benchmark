find yourself drawn into surprising conversations. The first group you approach is standing under a string of twinkling lights. They are laughing about something you can’t quite catch, so you politely ask, “What’s so funny?” They turn to you with wide grins and tell you they’re discussing dreams—how some are bizarre, others prophetic, and some so vivid they linger throughout the day.  

Before you can respond, one of them turns to you and asks, “Do you ever dream that you’re somewhere you don’t know anyone?” The question feels strange, almost as if they’re aware of the very dream you’re currently in. You start to respond, but a tug of curiosity pulls you away from the group, and you wander further into the gathering.

Next, you approach a table where a small circle of people is playing a card game you don’t recognize. The cards are illustrated with abstract images: a staircase leading to nowhere, a clock without hands, a key floating in a stormy sky. You try to ask about the rules, but everyone at the table speaks in whispers, their voices blending together in a hum that’s soothing yet incomprehensible. You reach for one of the cards, curious, but before your fingers touch it, a hand gently taps your shoulder.

You turn to see the one person you actually know, but their face isn’t clear. You can’t quite remember their name, but their presence feels warm and familiar. They take your hand and lead you through a winding hallway that wasn’t there before. The walls are lined with mirrors, but none of the reflections look like you or the person guiding you. Instead, they show dreamlike scenes of distant places: a desert lit by three moons, a forest where the trees shimmer like glass, a city suspended upside down in the clouds.

The mirrors seem alive, and as you gaze at one, its surface begins to ripple. Without thinking, you step forward, drawn in by a sense of yearning to explore what’s on the other side. The moment you touch the glass, you’re pulled through, and you find yourself standing in—

Would you like to continue the dream from here?
