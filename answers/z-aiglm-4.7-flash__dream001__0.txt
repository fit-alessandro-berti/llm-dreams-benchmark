You start to panic, but then you notice the pavement melting beneath your feet, turning into a silent river of quicksilver. Without a word, a sleek, silver glider appears in the air, offering you a ride. You step inside, and the wind rushes past your face not with chaos, but with a melody that matches your racing heartbeat. The cityscape below shifts and folds like paper, revealing shortcuts you never knew existed. Ten minutes later, you glide effortlessly through a window into a ballroom floating in the clouds, where your bewildered colleagues are already waiting, sipping tea and smiling at your arrival, as if they had been expecting you all along.
