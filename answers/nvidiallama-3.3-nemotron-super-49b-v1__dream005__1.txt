**Continuation of the Dream**

...and navigate through a kaleidoscope of unfamiliar faces, the din of conversations enveloping me like a warm, overwhelming blanket. The air is thick with the scent of freshly baked canapés and the distant tang of champagne. I clutch my glass of mimosa, a self-proclaimed lifeline in this sea of strangers, as I scan the room for the one familiar face—Emily, a coworker from a project last year.

As I edge past a group engaged in a heated debate about the latest sci-fi movie, one of them, a tall, bespectacled man with a passionate gesture, accidentally knocks against my arm, causing my mimosa to wobble precariously in my hand.

"Oh no, I'm so sorry!" he exclaims, his eyes widening in alarm as he quickly grabs a handful of napkins from a nearby table to steady my drink.

"No harm done, thanks to your quick reflexes," I reply with a smile, taking a napkin from him to wipe a minor spill on my sleeve. "Guess I owe you one. I'm... [pausing briefly, realizing I hadn't introduced myself in the dream yet] ...May."

"I'm Max," he responds, extending a hand, which I shake. "And you're clearly on a mission, judging by your 'lost in thought' expression before our little accident. Lost someone?"

I nod, "Actually, yes. Trying to find Emily. We worked on a project together last year. Tall, curly brown hair?"

Max's face lights up. "Emily Wilson? I think she's out on the backyard patio, leading some sort of impromptu gardening workshop. I was just heading back there myself, fascinated by her plant rehabilitation techniques."

Together, Max and I navigate through the house, the crowd thinning out as we approach the patio doors. The transition from the warm, bustling interior to the cool, serene outdoors is refreshing. The backyard is a lush, vibrant oasis, with Emily indeed at its center, surrounded by a semi-circle of attentive listeners as she coaxes life back into a wilted orchid.

As we approach, Emily looks up, her face illuminating with a warm smile upon seeing me. "May! Right on time to save me from these plant murderers!" The group chuckles, and Emily hands her orchid to a willing volunteer before embracing me briefly.

"May, this is everyone... and apparently, you've already met Max here," she says, glancing at Max with a hint of amusement.

As the workshop winds down, Emily suggests we grab some fresh air away from the crowd, leading Max, myself, and a couple of others who tag along, intrigued by the dynamic, to a quaint, secluded corner of the garden. There, under the soft glow of string lights beginning to twinkle as dusk approaches, conversations flow more deeply, connections are made, and the initial anxiety of being alone in a crowd dissipates.
