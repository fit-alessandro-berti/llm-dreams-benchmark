...feel a warm sense of relief wash over you. Their faces blur slightly, as dreams often do, but their voices are clear and welcoming. One person hands you a small, glowing map that seems to shift and change as you look at it, showing not just streets but memories and emotions as pathways.

"You're not really lost," one of them says with a gentle smile, "you're just between chapters."

As they walk beside you through the city that now feels less intimidating, the buildings begin to soften around the edges. Streetlights bloom into dandelions, and the rush of traffic transforms into a soothing hum. You realize that following them doesn't mean giving up control—you're learning to trust the journey itself.

The dream whispers its secret: sometimes being lost is just how we discover new ways to find ourselves.

Would you like to continue this dream in a different direction?
