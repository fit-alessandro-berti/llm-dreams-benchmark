decide to leave the safety of the bunker, because the silence inside was louder than the storms outside. You shoulder your pack, check the seals on your filtered mask, and push open the heavy steel door.

Day 1: The Scorch
The world outside is a bleached expanse, the sun a white coin hammered into a pale sky. The wind is steady, carrying a fine dust that glitters with mica and something else, something that stings your eyes. You follow the ghost of an old highway, its asphalt fractured into stepping stones. A long-dead convoy sits where it died; you scrape rust from a fuel tank and manage to coax a few drops of usable liquid into your reserve. You are not alone. High above, a kite-shaped drone drifts on thermal currents, its camera lens a single black eye. It doesn’t descend. Not yet.

Night 1: Static
You make camp in the ribcage of a toppled water tower. As the temperature plummets, you build a tiny fire of twisted sage. From a nearby ridge, you hear it: a voice, thin and broken, carried over the radio. It’s not words, just a melody of static that resolves into a woman’s hum, a lullaby from before the fall. You answer, pressing the transmit key. The hum stops. The radio goes dead.

Day 2: The Signal
You follow the ridge to its source: a crumbling radio station, its antenna bent like a question mark. Inside, you find a generator humming on the last dregs of fuel and a console wired to a solar array on the roof. On the screen, a message flashes: *If you are reading this, I am at the Sky Needle. Bring the key.* There is no key. But there is a map, and a photograph of a woman with a pilot’s eyes, standing in front of a helicopter that looks like a dragonfly made of glass.

Day 3: The Test
The Sky Needle is a tower that pierces the smog layer, a relic of the old world’s ambition. You climb. The stairs are gone, so you use the maintenance ladder, your muscles burning with the effort. At the top, you find a small platform and a wind turbine. There is a person there, sitting with their back to you. It’s the woman from the photo, though older, scarred. She doesn’t turn around.
“You found the station,” she says. Her voice is the hum from the radio. “Do you have the key?”
“I have the map,” you reply, holding it out.
She turns. Her eyes are the color of the storm. “The map was the key. You had to be willing to walk to find it, not just wait for the voice to save you.”
She gestures to the horizon. A storm is brewing, a wall of black cloud. But inside the cloud, there are lights. Not lightning. Lights.

The Choice
The woman, who calls herself the Keeper, offers you a choice, presented with a simple object she pulls from a leather satchel:
1.  **The Helicopter:** A small, functional vehicle fueled by solar cells and distilled water. “It will take you to the Sanctuary,” she says. “It’s safe. Boring, but safe. You’ll live.” But the seat is singular.
2.  **The Radio Array:** She points to the complex machinery humming around the tower. “This can broadcast a signal across the entire continent. We can call the scattered survivors together. But the power surge will burn out the turbine. The tower will be dark within a day, and we’ll have to defend this spot against everyone who hears it.”

You look at the storm, and the lights within it. You look at the solitary seat of the helicopter. You reach for—

*How does the dream end?*
