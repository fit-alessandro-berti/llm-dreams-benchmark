...stop running. You realize that in a dream, the scarcity is only a reflection of your own fear. You kneel down on the cracked asphalt of a ruined highway, where the grey dust swirls like restless ghosts.

From your tattered pocket, you pull out a single, dried sunflower seed. It feels heavy, pulsating with a warmth that defies the cold wind. You press it into a fissure in the concrete.

You don't water it with water; you water it with a memory of the sun.

Instantly, the ground trembles—not with an earthquake, but with a deep, earthen breath. A stalk bursts forth, spiraling upward at impossible speed. It is not made of plant matter, but of stained glass and fiber-optic light. It grows higher than the hollow skeletons of the skyscrapers, piercing the toxic smog.

The "dangers" lurking in the shadows—creatures made of rusted metal and teeth—creep closer. But as the giant glass flower blooms, it releases a pollen of golden light. When the light touches the monsters, they don't attack. They dissolve into flocks of butterflies and drifting dandelion seeds.

The world is no longer hungry. The glass flower drips nectar that tastes like vanilla and safety. You lie down at the base of this impossible tree, watching the grey sky crack open to reveal a universe of neon purple stars, knowing that as long as you stay asleep, you are the gardener of the wasteland.
