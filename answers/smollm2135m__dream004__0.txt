"Ah, an intriguing image! I see the emptiness of the painting expanding. As I step past it, the colors swirling around me begin to change - from delicate pinkish hues bleeding into vibrant reds... And the shapes, they appear distorted because nothing in this world can withstand their transformations. The air is filled with a sickly feeling that seeps deep within my bones," I say aloud, attempting to draw a clearer image.

My gaze drifts upward as I move closer to the canvas, and for awhile, I'm still immersed in the surreal dreamscape of this seemingly insignificant yet captivating world.
