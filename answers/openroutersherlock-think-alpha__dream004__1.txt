You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and feel an irresistible urge to touch it. Your fingers brush the surface, and suddenly, the canvas ripples like liquid mercury, sucking you in with a gentle whoosh.

Inside, you're floating in a void of swirling nebulae—emerald greens melting into fiery crimsons, cubes unfolding into infinite fractals. Your thoughts become brushes: with a whisper of "ocean," waves of sapphire crash across the canvas-walls, drenching you in salty mist. You laugh and paint "wings," sprouting iridescent feathers that lift you higher, soaring through tunnels of velvet stars.

But then the canvas trembles. Shapes rebel, twisting your creations into mischievous beasts—grinning elephants with polka-dot trunks chasing rainbow serpents. You chase them, heart pounding with glee, until the whole realm folds inward like origami, compressing into a single glowing point.

You awaken with a start, the blank canvas from your dream now etched faintly on your bedroom wall, waiting for your next stroke.
