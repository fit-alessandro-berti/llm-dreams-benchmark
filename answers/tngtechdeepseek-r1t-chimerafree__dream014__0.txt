You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you hesitantly accept, their warmth melting your unease. They lead you through winding streets that shift like liquid—neon signs blurring into constellations, cobblestones softening to sand. One stranger hums a melody you half-remember from childhood; another hands you a lantern glowing with bioluminescent light.  

As you walk, the city transforms. Skyscrapers bloom into ancient trees, and the noise fades to a symphony of whispers guiding you forward. You realize the strangers’ faces are familiar now—echoes of old friends, ancestors, or perhaps versions of yourself you’ve yet to meet. They bring you to a bridge arched over a river of stars, where one murmurs, *"You were never lost. You were always arriving."*  

When you wake, the words linger like a compass in your pocket, still warm from their hands.
