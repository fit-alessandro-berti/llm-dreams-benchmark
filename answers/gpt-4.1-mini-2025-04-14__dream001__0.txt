You start to walk through the bustling streets, scanning every sign and asking passersby for directions, but everyone seems to give you conflicting answers. The buildings around you shift subtly, their shapes bending and twisting as if the city itself is alive and playing a trick on you. Suddenly, your phone buzzes, but when you check it, the screen shows only a swirling mist instead of your notifications. Heart pounding, you take a deep breath and decide to follow a faint, glowing path that appears on the pavement, hoping it will lead you to your meeting. As you walk, the noise of the city fades into a calm hum, and the glowing path grows brighter, guiding you toward an unknown destination that promises answers—or perhaps even more mysteries.
