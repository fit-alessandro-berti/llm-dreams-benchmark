adapt quickly to survive. The air smells of woodsmoke and wild herbs, the hum of distant conversation is in a language you only half understand. Your clothing has changed: rough homespun fabric against your skin, heavy boots laced with rawhide. 

You step outside, blinking in the softer, golden light. A dirt path winds between low, timber-built houses and livestock roam freely—pigs, chickens, a pair of shaggy cows. Hunger rumbles in your stomach and you realize you'll need to find food, water, and perhaps shelter for the night.

First, you approach a nearby well, watching how a group of villagers draw water with a wooden bucket. They glance at you curiously but not unkindly. You mimic their movements, grateful as cool, clean water slips down your throat.

As you wander further, you notice a gathering at the village square. A market is forming—tables laden with root vegetables, bread loaves, and the sharp tang of cheese. People barter and trade. You pat your pockets, but find only a strange token—a coin with a symbol you don't recognize. It might be enough to buy you something, if you can muster the courage to speak.

Feeling both fear and excitement, you step forward, ready to negotiate, to learn—and to discover who you must become in this strange old-new world.
