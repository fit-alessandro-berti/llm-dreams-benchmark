…walk, at first calmly, then faster, shoes skimming asphalt that doesn’t sound quite right. The streets are too long, like they’ve been stretched while you weren’t looking. Buildings rear up—glass, brick, ornate facades—each one with too many windows, every window lit, every light a tiny impatient eye.

You check your pockets for an address, a name, anything. Your fingers find a folded paper that wasn’t there before. It’s blank except for a single moving dot. As you watch, the dot slides upward across invisible lines, as if it’s tracking your position on a map that refuses to reveal itself. You’re late already, you can feel it, though your watch face is brimming with numbers that rotate like a combination lock and never resolve into a time.

You choose a direction.

The city responds.

The crosswalk signal becomes an open eye. It blinks green, and you hurry across. Cars wait patiently, all the drivers turned toward you, faces obscured by a pale fog on the inside of the glass. You hear your name through the closed windows—whispered, sung, mispronounced. You don’t remember giving your name to anyone.

Street signs are wrong. One reads “ALMOST THERE.” Another: “TURN BACK.” Another simply says “SOON.” You spin in place, trying to get oriented, and notice the skyscrapers shift a few degrees, like tall people politely making space in a crowded elevator.

Your phone appears in your hand—of course you had it all along. There’s one calendar event:

MEETING
Location: Wherever You Think It Is
Time: In An Hour Ago

Your heart jolts. You try to call someone, anyone—your boss, a friend, a stranger—but every contact name slowly morphs into your own. When you press call, your own voice answers from distant speakers in the sky: “I’m on my way.”

You duck into a side street to escape the gaze of the towers. It narrows too fast, walls sliding inward with every step until your shoulders brush both sides. Dim yellow bulbs hang overhead, swinging without air. A door appears to your left, just a door, freestanding in the alley with no frame, no building.

Carved into the wood: THIS ISN’T IT.

You open it anyway.

You step into a lobby that might be a hotel or an office or a train station, an impossible intersection of all three. Marble floors, thick red carpet, escalators ascending into a ceiling painted like a cloudy sky that moves too quickly. People pace in circles, each holding folders stamped with the same symbol: a small, black keyhole.

“Excuse me,” you say to the nearest person, but when they turn, it’s your face, slightly older. “Conference rooms are down there,” they say, pointing at an elevator bay. Their eyes are ringed with fatigue you suddenly recognize.

You rush to the elevators. The buttons aren’t numbers; they’re words:

- SOON
- LATE
- BEFORE
- NEVER
- HOME

You slam “SOON.”

The elevator doors don’t open. Instead, the entire wall steps backward like a sliding stage set, revealing a train platform. A train sighs in, completely silent, all its windows dark. Above it, a sign:

EXPRESS TO YOUR APPOINTMENT

This feels correct. It also feels like a trap. But your chest is tight with urgency, so you get on.

Inside, every seat is occupied by different versions of you: younger, older, dressed for jobs you don’t remember ever having, holding notebooks, flowers, briefcases, nothing. They all look up when you enter.

“You’re cutting it close,” one of them says.

“Where is it?” you ask.

They answer in overlapping echoes: “You know.” / “You knew.” / “You will.” / “Sit down.”

The train lurches. Outside, the city blurs into a time-lapse of its own life—construction cranes snapping buildings into place, trees sprouting from bare dirt, billboards flickering through decades of ads in seconds. You’re sweating. You try to open your calendar again, and the screen shows a mirror instead. In the reflection, your clothes have changed. You’re wearing exactly what you would wear to the most important meeting of your life.

A chime. The doors open onto a floor high above the city, though you don’t remember the train going up. A corridor stretches ahead, carpet swallowing your footsteps. At the end: a glass door with your name etched cleanly at eye level.

This is it. This has to be it.

Your pulse slows as you reach for the handle. As your fingers touch it, the glass goes opaque. New words etch themselves beneath your name:

YOU’RE LATE

The door clicks locked.

Panic claws up. You rattle the handle, knock, slam your fist. On the other side, muted voices, the shuffle of papers, a chair scraping. You can almost make out someone saying, “Well, if they’re not here…”

“I am here!” you shout. “I’m here!”

Silence.

Then, from behind you, a soft sound: the clearing of a throat.

You turn.

It’s you again—but not quite. They’re dressed simply, no watch, no briefcase, no frantic look in their eyes. Calm. They hold the original folded paper—the one with the moving dot. Now the map is fully drawn: the city’s veins and spirals, all converging at a single point not where you stand, but far away, in a quiet park shaped like a question mark.

“You were supposed to meet yourself,” they say. “Not them.”

You blink. “I don’t understand. I missed it, didn’t I? The meeting.”

The other you smiles with something like pity and something like relief. “You keep dreaming it’s with someone else. A boss. A judge. A committee. A chance.” They offer you the paper. The map’s ink shivers, alive. “It was always just you.”

You look back at the locked door, then at the map. The city seems to hold its breath.

“If I go now,” you ask, “will they still be there? Will I?”

“That depends,” they say. “On whether you keep walking toward rooms full of strangers, or toward the one person you’ve been late to meet your whole life.”

You hesitate, then choose.

You let go of the useless door handle.

The hallway ripples, its length shrinking to a step. The building’s walls turn transparent, revealing streets re-threading themselves, untangling into a simple path leading to green, to open sky. Each distant traffic light turns green in sequence, like an invitation.

You take a breath that feels like your first honest one in years, and you start to walk—not fast, not frantic this time, just forward—as the dream-city gently folds itself around your decision, guiding you where, somehow, you’ve known you were meant to be.
