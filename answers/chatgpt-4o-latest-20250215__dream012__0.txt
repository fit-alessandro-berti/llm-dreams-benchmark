feel the weight of responsibility pressing down on your shoulders. The wind howls like a chorus of ghosts, and the rain lashes against the deck with a fury that threatens to rip the ship apart. Lightning cracks across the sky, illuminating the fear in your crew’s eyes. You tighten your grip on the ship’s wheel, steadying yourself as the vessel bucks beneath you.  

“We hold the course!” you bellow, your voice cutting through the storm. “Trust the ship, trust each other!”  

A monstrous wave rises ahead, a wall of darkness ready to swallow you whole. The crew braces themselves, some whispering hurried prayers, others clenching their teeth in defiance. You take a deep breath, your pulse steady, your mind sharpening.  

And then—something impossible happens.  

The wave does not crash. Instead, it *parts*, as though some unseen force is guiding your ship through the tempest. For a fleeting moment, an eerie calm settles over the deck. Time slows, the sound of the storm fades, and you swear you hear a whisper carried on the wind.  

*"This is not the end."*  

Then, as suddenly as it came, the storm collapses inward. But you are no longer on the same sea. The skies clear, revealing a twilight horizon that shimmers like liquid gold. The water beneath your ship is smooth and glass-like, reflecting constellations you do not recognize. The air hums with something ancient, something alive.  

Your crew stares in stunned silence.  

“Captain,” your first mate says, his voice barely above a whisper. “Where are we?”  

You look out at this strange, celestial ocean, feeling an odd sense of déjà vu.  

“I don’t know,” you admit. “But I think we were meant to find it.”  

Far ahead, on the horizon, a silhouette emerges—a towering island, its peaks crowned with light, its shores pulsing with an unseen energy. You feel an unexplainable pull, as if this place has been waiting for you.  

And so, with steady hands, you turn the wheel. The adventure is just beginning.
