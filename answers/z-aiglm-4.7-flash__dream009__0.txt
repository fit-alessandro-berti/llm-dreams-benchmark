...realize you need **to bridge the silence with a greeting that transcends time.** The air is thick with the scent of woodsmoke and unwashed bodies, and the stark, grey stone beneath your feet feels colder than the pavement you left behind. Your hand reflexively brushes against the empty pocket of your jeans, seeking the reassurance of a familiar switchblade or smartphone, but finding only the rough, coarse wool of a stranger's tunic. You need to communicate your peaceful intent to the crowd of robed figures watching you from the shadows, because you know that in this era, silence can be mistaken for a threat.
