The sky above, once a brilliant blue, is now dark and foreboding, with clouds that seem to swirl and twist in every direction. I can hear the distant rumble of thunder, and the air is electric with the promise of a storm.

As I walk, the trees seem to grow taller and closer together, their branches creaking and groaning ominously in the wind. I feel a few drops of rain start to fall, pattering against my skin and making the leaves beneath my feet slick with moisture.

Suddenly, a loud clap of thunder booms through the forest, making me jump. I look up to see a bolt of lightning illuminate the dark sky, and for a moment, I see a figure standing in the distance. It's a woman, her long hair streaming behind her like a banner, and she's beckoning me towards her.

I'm left standing alone, surrounded by the howling wind and the flashes of lightning. I take a deep breath, and then I start to run, dashing through the forest as the storm closes in around me...
