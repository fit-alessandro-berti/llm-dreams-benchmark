follow them into a hidden alleyway that shimmers like liquid silver under the neon lights. The strangers' faces morph into glowing masks of forgotten memories—your childhood dog, a long-lost friend, the face of your first love—all smiling with eyes like swirling galaxies.

They lead you through a door that wasn't there before, into a rooftop garden floating above the city, where trees whisper secrets in languages of wind and fireflies. "Home is not a place," they say in unison, their voices a chorus of rain on cobblestones, "but a feeling you carry."

You reach out, and the world tilts; the city below dissolves into stars, and you realize you're not lost—you're the map. Laughter bubbles up from your chest as you soar, weightless, into the dream's endless sky... until the first light of dawn tickles your eyelids, and you wake with a smile, the city's hum echoing softly in your heart.
