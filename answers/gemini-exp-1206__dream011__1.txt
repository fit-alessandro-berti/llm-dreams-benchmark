... you notice the questions are **written in a language you've never seen before, a series of swirling, iridescent symbols that seem to hum faintly on the page.**  Panic starts to rise, a cold tide in your chest. You look around, but everyone else is scribbling away furiously, brows furrowed in concentration. They seem to understand the cryptic script.

Suddenly, a small, **paper bird, folded from a corner of the exam, unfolds itself and flutters onto your desk.** It chirps, a sound like tinkling glass, and nudges your pen with its origami beak. As you hesitantly reach out to touch it, the symbols on the page shift, resolving themselves into images. Not words, but moving, living scenes.

The first question shows a **field of dying flowers, their petals turning to dust.** You instinctively know you must help them. You close your eyes, picturing the vibrant blooms they once were, imagining the warmth of the sun, the coolness of the rain. When you open your eyes, the image on the page shimmers. Tiny droplets of water appear on the wilted petals, and the flowers slowly begin to unfurl, their colours returning.

The paper bird chirps again, pleased. The next question transforms, showing **a caged bird, beating its wings against the bars.**  This time, you know what to do. You focus on empathy, on the bird's longing for freedom, the wind beneath its wings. As your thoughts take flight, the cage door on the page swings open, and the bird within soars into a brilliant blue sky.

Each question is a similar challenge, a problem requiring not knowledge, but **understanding, compassion, and the power of imagination.**  You realize this isn't an exam of facts and figures, but a test of your heart, your ability to connect with the world on a deeper level. You're not just answering questions, you're shaping reality, mending what's broken, setting things free.

As you work, the room around you dissolves, replaced by the vibrant landscapes depicted on the exam paper. You become a part of the dream, a conductor of its magic, weaving a tapestry of hope and healing. The final question appears, **a blank space, swirling with potential.**  The paper bird lands on your shoulder, its fragile body warm against your skin. You know, without a doubt, that this final question is not about finding an answer, but about choosing a path, about creating the future you desire... and you smile, knowing you are ready.
