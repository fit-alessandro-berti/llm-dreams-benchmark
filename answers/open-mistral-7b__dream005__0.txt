feel a bit overwhelmed by the crowd and the noise. You spot a group of people laughing and chatting animatedly in the corner. You approach them, trying to blend in, but you can't quite follow their conversation. Feeling a bit out of place, you decide to move on.

As you walk through the crowd, you see another group of people huddled around a table, engrossed in a game. You watch for a moment, intrigued, but then remember that you're looking for your familiar face.

Suddenly, you hear a familiar voice calling out your name. You turn around and see your friend waving at you from across the room. Relieved, you make your way towards them, feeling a sense of relief wash over you. You spend the rest of the evening catching up with your friend and meeting a few new people along the way.

The dream ends with you feeling content and satisfied, knowing that you've made a connection in the sea of unfamiliar faces.
