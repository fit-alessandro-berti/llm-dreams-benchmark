The spotlight hits me like a physical force, warm and overwhelming. A wave of expectant faces rises from the sea of chairs—thousands of eyes locked on me, waiting. My throat tightens. *Why can’t I remember my notes? What if I forget the first sentence?* My palms slick with sweat, I wipe them on my suit, but the fabric feels like sandpaper. The microphone hums to life, and my voice cracks as I try to speak:  

“L-ladies and gentlemen—”  

A sudden stillness falls. The crowd doesn’t move. The hum of the mic fades into silence. Then, something shifts. The faces at the front begin to shimmer, dissolving like ink in water. The seats, the walls, the entire auditorium melt away—not into darkness, but into a vast, starry expanse. I’m standing alone on a floating platform of light, suspended in the cosmos. The “crowd” isn’t gone. It’s *everywhere*—a torrent of glowing constellations, swirling nebulae, and distant galaxies, all pulsing in harmony with the rhythm of my heartbeat.  

And then I understand: I’m not giving a speech *to* them.  
*They’re the speech.*  

No words come. Instead, my thoughts expand outward, merging with the cosmic tide. Words dissolve. Meaning becomes texture: the warmth of a distant sun, the echo of a dying star’s song, the silence between planets. I realize—the dreams I’ve forgotten, the fears I’ve buried, the love I’ve held inside—*this* is what they’ve been waiting for. Not a polished monologue, but the raw, trembling truth of what it means to be alive in this vast, beautiful strange universe.  

A whisper rises from the stars themselves, not in sound, but in light:  
***“You were always part of it. Just breathe.”***  

I close my eyes. And for the first time in years, I feel utterly, perfectly held.  

*(The dream ends not with applause, but with the quiet hum of galaxies turning.)*
