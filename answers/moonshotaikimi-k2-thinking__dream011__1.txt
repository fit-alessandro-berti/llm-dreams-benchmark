...written in a language you don't recognize, yet somehow you understand you were fluent in it just yesterday. The first question reads: *"If a memory has no witness, does it cast a shadow? Calculate the weight of its silence using the quadratic formula of regret."*

You flip through the pages, but they're all glued together at the edges, forming a single thick sheet that dissolves at your touch. Each question you manage to read transforms as you read it:

Question 2: *"Your third-grade teacher's laugh had 12 syllables. List them in reverse alphabetical order."*

The exam booklet is growing heavier. The pages are now made of glass, and the words swim beneath the surface like tropical fish. You try to write with your pen, but it writes only in the color of sounds—the answer to question 3 emerges as a deep blue hum that makes the proctor weep ink.

The proctor is your future self, but they're aging rapidly, crumbling to dust as they whisper: *"You have always been taking this exam. Your first word as a baby was the answer to question 7."*

You look around. The other students are filling their papers with elegant, confident answers. One of them is you from a parallel timeline, and they're waving—no, they're dissolving their exam into a bird that flies away. Your own hands are turning into questions marks.

The clock on the wall is melting, but backward. For every minute that passes, you lose a year of your life. The exam paper now asks: *"What is the sound of your career ambitions at the moment of evaporation? Please provide three examples from your childhood."*

Suddenly you remember: you never enrolled in this course. You never even chose this career. The entire university is inside your childhood lunchbox, and the exam is being graded by your father who left when you were six. He writes in the margins with a voice like rustling leaves: *"See me after class."*

But there is no after. There is only this moment, stretching infinitely, the questions now written on the inside of your eyelids, and you realize you've been asleep during every lecture, and the final exam is dreaming you.
