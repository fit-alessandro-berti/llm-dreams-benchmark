You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to **speak—but the words that leave your mouth shimmer like liquid gold, coalescing into delicate, fluttering birds that rise above the crowd**. Gasps ripple through the auditorium as the creatures swirl, their wings casting prismatic shadows on the faces below. You falter, then notice the birds aren’t fleeing; they’re listening. 

The audience leans forward, their critical stares softening into wonder. You breathe deeper, your voice gaining strength, and with each sentence, more birds hatch midair—a cacophony of colors, shapes, and songs. The stage beneath your feet morphs into a vast oak tree, roots spiraling into the earth as the ceiling dissolves into a twilight sky. The crowd is gone now, replaced by a forest of towering silhouettes, their branches swaying in rhythm with your cadence. 

You realize you’re not reciting a prepared speech at all. You’re improvising, weaving stories from memories and myths, and the forest drinks it all in. When you finish, the oak beneath you blooms with luminous flowers, each petal etching your words into the night. A breeze lifts you upward, the tree shrinking to a seedling in your palm as you drift skyward. 

You wake with the taste of sap on your tongue and the lingering hum of wings, unsure if the speech was a dream—or if the dream was the speech.
