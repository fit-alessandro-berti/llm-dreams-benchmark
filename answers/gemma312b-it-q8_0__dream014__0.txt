You are feeling lost and alone in a a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help me find my way and you… immediately hesitate. Not from distrust, mind you, but from something else altogether. A pull, a knowing. It isn’t my destination they're trying to lead me *to*, it’s showing me how to navigate a feeling rather than a place.

They are all shapes and sizes, ages swirling together – but each has remarkably still, amber eyes, mirroring anxieties I hadn’t spoken aloud. One, an elderly woman woven in patchwork scarves, says softly, “You seem… adrift.”

I stumble for an answer, "I, uh, I forgot where I was going." Which felt like simultaneously the truth and a gross simplification. These aren’t ordinary faces. Their kindness vibrates - it rings a note inside me I didn't know existed. Fear is battling alongside it, like static to music.

Rather than guiding me with frantic hand gestures and hurried instructions, one of the strangers – a young man perched upon a stack of books piled precariously beneath a faded awning – simply points. "See that pigeon pecking for seed?" He asks. 

Confused, I nod.

"See how it focuses? Its world is just that one spot, the hunger to find enough. You're noticing grand skylies and overwhelming crowds trying to 'find the destination' but missing the simple, nourishing moments."

Another stranger, a girl with bright, spiraled hair, adds, “Lost is a feeling, dear. Not a location.” She holds out a single violet. 

Slowly, carefully, taking in her scent and its velvet texture. Then my eyes focus again – no longer frantic searching of towering buildings and rushing figures - instead, I notice the sun warm on my cheeks. Small cracks in the sidewalk blooming with defiant little flowers.  The hum of conversations, some pleasant, one heartbreaking.

A profound quiet descends within me. My “feeling lost” begins to soften, peeling back at layer at a time like petals unveiling a core of quiet resilience. There isn't just one objective - just experiences, layers of feelings. It isn't so much about finding a way out of the city, as about finding my presence *within* the overwhelming. 

Finally, that warmth radiating from the strangers - less a comfort *given*, and more a recognition that, somehow all I ever needed was within me all along to find my way. Slowly, they dissolve as shadows shifting – becoming one thing becoming many — while the city noise now a soothing, familiar thrum. 

I am not *not* lost. 
It just doesn't feel quite so terribly lonely.
