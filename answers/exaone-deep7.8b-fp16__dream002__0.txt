Your dream continues as you stand in the heart of the forest, the air suddenly brisk with a hint of rain. The sky above you darkens prodigiously, clouds swirling into a slate-gray wedge that hums with invisible energy. Thunder rumbles faintly behind you, like a distant growl, and the wind whips through the trees, carrying with it the scent of wet soil and impending storm.  

You feel the ground slipper *slick*, and your breath quickens as reality sharpens—the world is no longer pastoral. The trees come alive around you: their branches claw upward like desperate hands, leaves scurrying into the dark. A beam of light escapes from the clouds far above, piercing the gloom, illuminating a glint of silver beneath the trunk of an ancient oak. Could it be a escape hatch... or an unlucky projectile?  

The thunder booms, growing urgent. Raindrops miss you, then hit the shield of your hands, the brim of your hat, or just dissolve against the rough bark of a nearby pine. Your clothes grow drenched, but your curiosity (and nerve) remain undimenished. You decide to follow the silver glint—half-panicked, half-eager—and find the small compartment hidden beneath the bark. Inside, wrapped in a frayed linen bandage, sits a compact waterproof bag filled with snacks and a flask of strong tea.  

As the storm crashes overhead, you bundle oneself into the bag, eating quickly while you peer out. The tempest pelts you for a while, but then, with a sudden turn, the clouds part like a purple veil. Sunlight floods the clearing, and the first raindrops have stopped.  

You step out, shaking droplets into the wind, your heart still racing but your mind alight with raw, primal exhilaration. The forest, now bathed in golden light, seems to breathe gratitude. You glance back at the shadowed tree that had whispered secrets in the dark—no longer a threat, but a silent guardian.  

Your dream ends there, leaving you with the tang of rain, the echo of thunder, and an unshakable sense that some mysteries are both beautiful and dangerous.
