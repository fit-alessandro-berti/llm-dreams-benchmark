…written entirely in ancient Sumerian cuneiform, but that’s not even the weird part.

The questions are about you. Not “you” in the abstract, college-student sense. They’re hyper-specific:

1. On the night of March 17, 2019, why did you pretend to be asleep when your mom checked on you at 2:13 a.m.?
2. Rank the following regrets in order of how often they keep you awake: a) the text you never sent, b) the apology you never gave, c) the door you slammed in 2011.
3. Calculate the exact number of times you’ve refreshed an ex’s Instagram story while claiming you were “just curious.”

You flip the page in panic and realize there are no pencils. Instead, there’s a single red crayon and a note that says, “Write in blood if you have to.”

The professor (who looks suspiciously like your childhood goldfish that died under mysterious circumstances) is walking between the desks, whispering, “Time’s almost up… and you still haven’t figured out question zero.”

You look down and see there’s a Question 0 written on the back of your hand in fading ink:

“Who were you before they told you who you had to be?”

The desk starts melting. The crayon turns into a feather. The walls of the exam hall peel away like old wallpaper, revealing an endless hallway of lockers, each one slamming open and shut with a different version of you inside (some successful, some failures, some wearing outfits you swore you’d never wear).

You stand up to scream that this isn’t fair, that this wasn’t on the syllabus, but when you open your mouth, nothing comes out except the sound of your alarm clock.

…Except the alarm clock is still going. It’s been going for six minutes now.

You’re awake. You’re late for something. And there’s a faint red smear on your hand that almost looks like the beginning of an answer.
