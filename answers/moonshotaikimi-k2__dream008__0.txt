—and you reach for your keyboard, but it bends like rubber. The keys melt between your fingers, spilling into the letters in the air. The conference room around you tilts, the floor becoming a slow conveyor that carries you past cubicles shaped like hourglasses. Sand trickles from one side of the office to the other, piling up beside little clocks strapped to people’s ankles. Every second that falls off melts into silver coins that roll away under desks.

Your boss is still watching, impossibly tall now, neck telescoping upward until his head knocks a ceiling tile loose. “Show me wireframes,” he booms, voice echoing from fluorescent lights that flicker like strobe. His tie slithers down and taps your shoulder—once, twice—each tap typing a line of code directly onto your skin. You look at your arm: HTML tags, CSS rules, JavaScript promises, looping tattoos. You scratch them; the code bleeds parentheses.

Somewhere behind you a siren howls—D flat—that’s the deadline itself, condensed into brassy sound. It blossoms into a red comet and swoops toward your monitor, leaving a tail of half-burnt sticky notes. You grab the comet like a stylus, smearing its tail across the screen. Wherever you draw, whole pages materialize in color: a landing page blooming petals that hiss into CSS grids, a backend API crystallizing from the hiss. Settle, you think, and the pages freeze into fresh documentation.

The conveyor floor ejects you at a door labeled “Launch at Dusk.” You tumble through it—not into the hall, but straight upward, into night sky that feels like brushed velvet. Constellations are wi-fi symbols and the moon is literally the GitHub logo. From its open “fork,” a silver rope lowers; your team, headless yet familiar, slides down handing you their exact missing heads. When you fit each head into place, the eyes open and pulse in warm welcome. Their mouths chant commit messages: “Merge, merge, merge.”

Below, the building has turned into a single, giant hourglass. The top bulb strings your code commits, each commit a glowing node. The bottom bulb waits empty except for a single hour remaining. You stare. The hourglass tilts, thin waist fracturing. You dive, clutching the silver rope, weaving the commits into a cascade that splashes safely into the bottom bulb just as the hour runs out. The glass reseals, glowing gold.

Gravity returns—you land back in your chair. Keyboard solid again. One browser tab open: “Deployment successful.” The conference-room clock now reads the exact final second of the deadline; as you watch, it clicks backward one second, then stops, red second hand tapping the glass as if winking.

Your boss shrinks back to normal size. He scrolls through the live site on his phone, nods once, and smiles with ten thousand teeth that are actually tiny launch buttons. “Good,” he says, voice now soft as lint rollers. An office plant unfurls into a banner: “Sprint complete. Nap permitted.” The lights dim to lullaby blue.

You lean back. The chair peels apart into clouds. Beneath the carpet, whales made of monospace font glide. And despite every impossible thing that just happened, you close your eyes, pull a blanket of sleeping semicolons over yourself, and let the next dream pull you gently under.
