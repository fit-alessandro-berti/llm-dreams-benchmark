You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and...

...the rooms keep shifting. Not dramatically — not like a nightmare — but subtly, the way rooms do in dreams, where you walk through a doorway expecting the kitchen and find yourself in a garden instead.

The first group you pass is laughing at something you almost heard. One of them turns and looks at you with a face you nearly recognize — a teacher, maybe, from a school you haven't thought about in years. She raises her glass as if you're old friends. You smile back and keep moving.

The music is coming from everywhere and nowhere. Something orchestral that occasionally becomes a song you know, just long enough to make you reach for the words before dissolving again.

You check your phone to text the one person you know, but the screen shows only your own reflection, slightly wrong. Your hair is different. You look rested in a way you can't remember being.

A man hands you a drink without explanation. It tastes like something from childhood — a specific afternoon, a specific kitchen window, light coming through at a particular angle. You want to ask him how, but he's already talking to someone else.

The crowd thickens. You pass through a room full of people speaking languages you almost understand. One phrase catches you — *you were always going to end up here* — though you can't be certain anyone actually said it.

Then, through a set of glass doors, you see the person you've been looking for. They're standing with their back to you, and the doors are right there, and your hand is on the handle, and—

the light changes to that specific amber that means the dream is ending—

and you understand, with the calm certainty that only exists in this state, that finding them was never really the point.

The gathering continues without you. The music resolves into something beautiful just as you—

wake.
