You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you gratefully accept, following them through the neon-lit streets that twist like veins of light. Their laughter echoes like a forgotten melody, pulling you deeper into the crowd. As you turn a corner, the city morphs—skyscrapers dissolve into ancient trees, and the strangers' faces shift into those of old friends you haven't seen in years. You realize this isn't just a path home; it's a journey through memories, where every step uncovers hidden doors to places you've always longed to revisit. The dream fades as you reach a glowing horizon, waking with a sense of warmth and possibility.
