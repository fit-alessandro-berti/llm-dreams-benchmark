You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to plant a garden.

Not just any garden—on the broken concrete of what was once a schoolyard, beneath a sky smudged with ash and stars, you dig with your bare hands, chipping away at the cracked pavement. The soil beneath is poison-drunk, but you’ve spent weeks collecting rainwater in rusted buckets, filtering it through charcoal and cloth. You scavenge seeds from abandoned pantries: bean pods curled like fossils, sunflower shells that crack open like secrets, the last tomato seed from a jar labeled “For Emergencies Only.”

The others call you mad. “The earth is dead,” says Mara, her face half-hidden behind a scarf woven from cable wire. “You’re wasting water. You’re wasting breath.”

But you whisper back, “Plants don’t care if the world ended. They just want to grow.”

Every night, you talk to the seeds. You tell them stories of forests that once reached the clouds, of laughter echoing in grocery aisles, of rain that didn’t taste of metal. You sing to them—off-key, cracked lullabies your grandmother used to hum.

And then, on the seventh day, a green shoot breaks through the ash.

It’s tiny. Fragile. A single leaf, trembling in the wind.

You collapse beside it, weeping—not from sorrow, but from the unbearable weight of hope.

By dawn, the others gather. They don’t speak. They kneel. One by one, they pull their own hidden seeds from pockets and boots—lettuce, melon, onion, pepper—from the last remnants of a world trying to forget itself.

The garden grows.

Not because the earth healed.

But because you refused to believe it was dead.

And somewhere, across the ruined miles, another gardener digs. And another. And another.

The world didn’t end.

It chose to begin again.
