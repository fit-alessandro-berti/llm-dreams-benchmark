You are dreaming. You are about in a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectfully at you, and you begin to hum. 

A strange melodic humming fills the vast echoing silence where a speech was expected. The expectation visibly drains from their faces. Not confusion, exactly. More…amusement, slowly blossoming. A girl near the front giggles, and her friend nudges her playfully back to silence. 

Instead of words, a tiny, silver hummingbird materializes in your hand, hovering within an invisible force field. It shines, pulsating with soft colors, and begins mimicking your hum – but with an even more complex series of trilling notes.

It’s enchanting, breathtaking. The audience begins to sway to its song, some laughing, some completely still, transfixed.

You realize you *don’t need* words. The little bird speaks for itself, weaving a tapestry of sonic beauty that speaks of swirling galaxies, blooming coral reefs, rustling leaves. It's a history not contained in dates or statistics, but felt. It communicates feeling – belonging, a longing for connection, a quiet hope for the future.

You watch it weave its magic, and with each elaborate trill, tendrils of luminous grass begin to unfurl across the stage floor, blossoming into flowers you're never seen before; luminous blues and silvers, pulsing faintly with light. 

Then, a voice. But not spoken through a vocal cord. It’s *felt*. A gentle assurance within your mind: “This is enough.”

Looking out at the audience, you don't see judging critics, or an expectation of structured thought. You only see softened faces - tears mixing with smiles - and a deep sense of shared understanding. 

As you raise your hand slightly towards the bird, its light expands, spreading like captured sunlight until the walls of the auditorium seem to shimmer, and the very air tastes like honeysuckle and warm rain. Then... everything dissolves into a shower of sparks, and the sensation of gentle floating...




You suddenly jolt awake, the lingering warmth of unheard melodies still singing within you.
