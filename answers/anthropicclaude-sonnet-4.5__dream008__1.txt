You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you...

...look down at your hands, but they seem unfamiliar—sometimes too many fingers, sometimes too few. The project brief keeps changing every time you try to read it, the words sliding off the page like water.
