You start to scan the endless grid of streets, hoping for a familiar landmark—any hint of a map that might lead you to the venue. The city is a maze of towering glass and steel, but it hums in a language you can't quite translate: the lights flicker in Morse, the cars glide silently, and the buildings seem to breathe. The air smells of rain on hot asphalt, and a faint perfume of oranges wafts from somewhere ahead.

Your watch flashes an urgent reminder: ten minutes and the meeting will commence. Panic rises, but the city responds like a living organism, as if it knows you’re in distress. Ahead, you notice a narrow alley lined with glowing lanterns that seem to pulse in sync with your heartbeat. You slip into it, hoping the dimmer light will hide your hurried steps.

In the alley, a lone figure stands beneath the lantern: a street musician, fingers dancing across a violin. The music is unlike any instrument you've heard; it's a cascade of whispers, a hum that seems to pull at the walls themselves. The violinist looks up, and for a moment, you realize the eyes don't belong to any real person—they're mirrors, reflecting your own face back at you.

“Lost,” you say into the wind, your voice echoing against the brick.

The violinist smiles, a slow, crooked grin that doesn't quite reach its eyes. “The city is a mirror of the mind,” it says, voice vibrating through the instrument. “If you look inside, you’ll find what you seek.”

You feel a chill, not from the air but from the realization that every corner of this strange metropolis is a fragment of your own thoughts—an echo of your memories. The city’s map is a collage of your life’s pathways, rearranged. The meeting you were supposed to attend? It turns out to be an appointment you've been avoiding—a confrontation with the person you are.

The violinist’s song shifts. The notes become a gentle lullaby, and with each chord, familiar landmarks emerge from the city’s facades: a small park with a bench where you first fell in love; a bakery that smelled of yeast from your childhood; the library that housed your first book of poetry.

You follow the melody, and every step feels like walking through your own past. The street names morph into the names of people who influenced you. The city is guiding you to a building that looks like no one’s memory—its façade is blank.

You step into the structure, and the air changes. The lights dim, and a single chair sits in the center, surrounded by an aura of calm. A voice—your own—whispers, "You need to meet yourself." The meeting you feared is not with another person, but with the parts of you that have been left behind, the dreams that slipped away like fog.

You sit in the chair, breathing slowly, and begin to speak. The city watches, its neon lights flickering in sync with your words. You talk to yourself about the decisions you made, the paths you did or did not choose, the love and fear that shaped your journey. You listen to your own voice, as if it were another person sitting across from you, listening.

When the hour you thought was the deadline arrives, the city doesn’t rush. Instead, it slows its pulse. There’s no urgent meeting to be had; the city itself has become your meeting place. In the quiet, you feel a release, a letting go of the anxiety that has been gnawing at the edge of your mind.

The violinist’s music fades, and the city’s lights dim to a soft twilight. The dream begins to blur, like the edges of a painting as if the canvas is being pulled away. You feel a gentle tug, but it’s warm and reassuring, not fearful.

You wake to the sound of an alarm on your phone—an honest reminder that it’s actually nine o'clock, and you’re already late. But in the space between the dream and reality, you carry a new understanding: that sometimes the most important meetings are not with others, but with ourselves.
