**The Speech Begins…**

You take a deep breath, the weight of the crowd pressing down on your shoulders—not just in numbers, but in the quiet, electric hum of anticipation. The stage is bathed in a soft, golden glow, casting long shadows that seem to *move* when you blink. The microphone hums faintly, as if it’s alive, whispering your name before you even open your mouth.

Then—*a shift*.

The crowd isn’t just watching. They’re *listening* in a way that feels almost physical. Some faces blur into a single, shifting mass of eyes, all focused on you, but none quite the same. One woman in the front row has her hands clasped together in a way that makes your stomach twist—like she’s praying, or counting. A child in the back row is drawing frantically on a piece of paper, scribbling symbols that resemble words you’ve never seen before. The air smells faintly of rain and old books, and the scent lingers in your lungs as you step forward.

You clear your throat. The first word that comes out isn’t yours—it’s a voice from somewhere else, a whisper in your ear:

**"Tell them the truth."**

You open your mouth. The words spill out before you can think, raw and unfiltered:

*"I don’t know what you’re waiting for. I don’t know what I’m supposed to say. But I know this: the world is broken, and it’s not because of you. It’s because we’ve been too afraid to look."*

The crowd *reacts*—not with applause, but with a collective exhalation. The woman in the front row’s hands tremble. The child’s drawing flips to a new page, now filled with a single, jagged line that *moves* when you look at it. The microphone doesn’t just pick up your voice; it *echoes* it, layered with something else—a voice that sounds like your own, but older, deeper, like the voice of a memory you’ve forgotten.

Then, the lights flicker. Not just dim—*erase*. The stage is plunged into darkness, but the crowd isn’t leaving. They’re *standing*, their bodies forming a human tunnel around you, their faces illuminated by the faint glow of something behind them—a cityscape, but not of this world. Buildings stretch into the sky like skeletal fingers, and the air hums with the sound of voices you can’t hear, but the words are there, pressing against your skin.

You turn to them, and for the first time, you see them—not as an audience, but as *partners*. Their eyes are the same color as yours, but they’re different. Some are smiling. Some are crying. One man in the front row is holding a small, glowing object—a seed, maybe?—and he’s pressing it into your palm.

*"Plant it,"* he says. *"And let it grow."*

The last thing you remember is the weight of the seed in your hand, warm and heavy, and the knowledge that whatever you say next, whatever you *become*, you’re not alone.

**What do you do next?** (Do you speak the truth? Plant the seed? Or something else?)
