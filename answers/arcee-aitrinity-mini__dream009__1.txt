You wake up lying on a coarse, woven mat in a small, dimly lit stone room. The air smells of damp earth and woodsmoke, not the sterile scent of modern cleaning products. Sunlight streams weakly through a small, high window covered by thick, woven reeds. You're in a completely different era.

**You realize you need to:**

1.  **Assess Your Situation & Find Food/Water:** Your stomach rumbles fiercely. Your modern clothes feel strange and out of place. Searching your pockets yields only lint and a faded picture of someone familiar in a completely different context. The room has a simple wooden door, but no lock. Stepping outside onto a narrow, stone-paved alleyway, you see no cars, only a few rough carts pulled by tired-looking horses or oxen. A low, distant clatter suggests a mill or workshop. Your first desperate need is water and sustenance. You scan the alley: a well in the corner, a small, rough stone structure beside it. You approach cautiously, dipping a bucket – it's cool and clean. Nearby, a small, open-fronted building has a large barrel on a wooden stand, labeled crudely with "Agua" in faded paint. You take a deep, quenching drink. Hunger gnaws stronger. Looking back down the alley, you see a sign above a doorway: "Panadería." You need bread, and soon.

2.  **Understand Your Surroundings & Find Shelter:** The sheer unfamiliarity of everything is overwhelming. You see people moving along the street, dressed in simple, practical clothing – wool tunics, rough linen, leather boots. They don't look surprised to see you, but neither do they engage you in conversation. One woman carries a large, woven basket on her head; a man gestures at you with a thick wooden staff. The architecture is different: houses built close together, often with shared walls, sloping roofs covered in thatch or tiles, small windows with wooden shutters. You notice the lack of electricity, running water inside houses, modern signage, and any digital devices. Your modern phone is useless, a dead slab in your pocket. The sheer scale of the era – the technology level, the social structure hinted at by the signs and people's occupations – hits you. You need to find a safe, dry place for the night and understand *why* you're here and how you can possibly return, but that feels impossibly distant right now.

3.  **Communicate & Seek Help/Information:** You attempt to speak to the woman carrying the basket. "Hello?" You try, but your words sound wrong in this environment – too sharp, too loud, perhaps. She glances at you, her expression unreadable, and hurries past without a word, casting a brief, wary look back. A man with a large, calloused hand gestures towards the Panadería door. "Pan?" he says simply, pointing. You nod vigorously. He gives a short, gruff nod and walks away. You realize basic gestures and simple words like "bread," "water," "help," and "house" are your only tools. You need to learn enough of this language to survive, and fast. You also need to find someone – a traveler, a priest, a scholar, or perhaps a kindly village elder – who might be willing to listen to your impossible story or at least help you find shelter and food. The dream shifts, focusing on the immediate struggle: finding your next meal and a place to rest your head in this bewildering, pre-modern world. The larger mystery of your arrival and how to return will have to wait until you're fed and somewhat safe.
