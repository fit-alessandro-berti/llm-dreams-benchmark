You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panic, your heart pounding in your chest. The city is a maze of towering skyscrapers, their glass facades reflecting the setting sun in a way that makes it hard to tell where one building ends and another begins. The streets are bustling with people, but everyone seems to be in a hurry, their faces a blur as they pass by.

You glance at your watch—4:58 PM. The meeting is at 5:00 PM, and you have no idea where it’s supposed to be. You pull out your phone, but the signal is weak, and the screen flickers uncontrollably. You try to call the person you’re supposed to meet, but the call drops before it even connects. 

You start walking, hoping that something will look familiar, but everything seems foreign. The streets are lined with strange signs in a language you don’t understand. The buildings are a mix of futuristic architecture and old-world charm, as if the city is a blend of different eras. You pass by a street vendor selling what looks like food, but it’s unlike anything you’ve ever seen—strange shapes and colors that seem to shift as you look at them.

Suddenly, you hear a faint ringing sound, like a church bell in the distance. You follow the sound, weaving through the crowds, your footsteps echoing on the cobblestone streets. The ringing grows louder, more insistent, guiding you deeper into the city. 

As you turn a corner, you see it—a large, ornate clock tower standing in the middle of a small square. The clock’s face is circular, with numbers that glow a soft, eerie blue. It’s 4:59 PM. You realize that the ringing is the clock’s chime, signaling the start of the hour.

You look around the square, hoping to find a clue about where to go next. There’s a small café across the street, its windows adorned with intricate patterns that seem to move when you’re not looking directly at them. You decide to enter, hoping to find someone who can help you.

Inside, the café is dimly lit, with a cozy atmosphere that contrasts sharply with the chaos outside. The barista, an elderly man with a kind face, greets you warmly. You ask him about the meeting location, but he just smiles and hands you a small, folded piece of paper. 

You unfold the paper to reveal a series of cryptic symbols and a single word: “Follow.”

Confused, you look up at the man, but he’s already tending to another customer. You glance around the café, noticing a group of people sitting in the corner, all wearing identical black suits and sunglasses. They seem to be watching you.

You feel a sense of urgency, knowing that time is running out. You quickly leave the café and follow the directions on the paper, which seem to be leading you towards the edge of the city. The streets become quieter, the buildings more sparse, until you find yourself in a deserted area with only a single, ancient-looking building standing alone.

The building is old, its walls weathered and worn, with a heavy wooden door that creaks as you push it open. Inside, the air is thick with the scent of incense, and you see a dimly lit room with a single figure sitting at a large, wooden desk.

As you approach, the figure turns around, and you realize it’s someone you recognize—though you can’t quite place who. They smile at you, and in that moment, you know that this is where you were meant to be.

The clock outside strikes 5:00 PM, and you take a deep breath, ready to face whatever comes next.
