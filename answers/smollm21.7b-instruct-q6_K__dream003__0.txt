...symbols etched onto its surface which seem to match constellations in the night sky. You feel an inexplicable urge to unravel these mysteries. Suddenly, a soft voice whispers in your mind, "Dreams are a treasure trove of possibilities." You begin to mentally dissect the patterns, aligning them with celestial bodies. The sound seems to fade away, but you sense it's guiding you through this labyrinthine puzzle.

As dawn breaks outside your window, you feel an eagerness to unravel more secrets from this dream world.

Inside lies a single note, written in familiar handwriting: "The true essence of reality awaits in where our mind meets the cosmos." This moment is your realization that dreams not only hold answers but also act as mirrors reflecting parts of who you are deep within.
