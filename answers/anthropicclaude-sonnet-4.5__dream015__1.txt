# Dream Continuation

Despite the hardships, you decide to **climb the rusted skeleton of what was once a skyscraper**.

Each handhold crumbles slightly under your grip, raining orange flakes into the wind. As you ascend, the wasteland below transforms—what seemed like endless gray chaos reveals hidden patterns. There are gardens growing in the blast craters. Small lights flickering in the subway entrances. Smoke rising from communal fires.

At the top, you find something impossible: a child's swing set, somehow intact, swaying gently in the wind. Seated on one swing is **a figure made entirely of photographs**—thousands of faces from the old world, layered and shifting like a hologram.

"Everyone thinks they're the last one," the figure says without moving its mouth. "But look."

It points to the horizon, where you now see them: dozens of other climbers on dozens of other ruins, all standing at the highest points, all looking around for the first time, all seeing each other simultaneously.

The figure hands you something—a seed, but it's warm like it's been held in someone's palm for years.

"The world ended," it whispers. "Now what will you begin?"

The swing set starts to dissolve into butterflies made of rust and starlight, and you realize you have to decide whether to climb down or **jump and see if you can fly**.

*What do you do?*
