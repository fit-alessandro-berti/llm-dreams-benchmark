and you decide to simply stop speaking. You close your mouth, but the words keep pouring out anyway, visible as thick, gray smoke that begins to fill the room. 

Your friend stops shouting. They watch the smoke coil around their ankles, then their waist, and their angry expression softens into confusion. As the smoke thickens, the walls of the room begin to breathe, expanding and contracting like a giant lung. You realize you aren't standing on a floor anymore, but on the surface of a dark, still lake, though your shoes remain dry.

The reason for the argument slips away from you, like a name you can't quite recall upon waking. You look at your friend, but their face is no longer familiar; it is a shifting mosaic of every person you have ever loved and lost. They reach out a hand that is now made of translucent glass, and when their fingers brush your cheek, it makes a sound like a wind chime in a breeze.

The anger dissolves into a heavy, underwater silence. You understand, with the absolute certainty that only exists in dreams, that if you apologize, the sky will turn green. You open your mouth to speak, but instead, you begin to fall upward, away from the lake, away from the friend, into the soft, white static of waking up.
