You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you realize your desk has turned into a boat floating in the middle of the office. The walls stretch into an endless hallway lined with ticking clocks, each one running faster than the last. Your keyboard has no letters, only shifting symbols, and every time you try to type, the keys melt like wax.

You look up and your boss’s face flickers into a giant stopwatch. The ceiling peels away to reveal a sky full of glowing spreadsheets raining down like snow. You grab one, but it turns into a paper airplane and flies off. You try to chase it, but your feet are stuck in a pool of sticky ink.

Then, out of nowhere, a coworker hands you a cup of coffee. It’s steaming, and the aroma feels like time slowing down. You take a sip and the clocks begin to rewind, the hallway folds back into your office, and your keyboard clicks into focus with every letter lighting up.

Your boss nods, satisfied, and you start typing furiously—only to realize you’re typing on a typewriter made of clouds, and each word you finish becomes a bird that flies out the window.

Right before the final word leaves, you wake up.
