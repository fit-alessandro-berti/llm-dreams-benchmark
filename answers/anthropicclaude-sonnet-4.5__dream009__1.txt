# The Dream Continues...

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find water before nightfall**.

The sun hangs lower than you'd like, casting long shadows through a dense forest of unfamiliar trees. Your throat is already dry, and you notice the air smells different—cleaner somehow, but also wild and untamed. There are no power lines cutting through the sky, no distant hum of traffic, no contrails from airplanes.

You hear a stream before you see it, following the sound through undergrowth that catches at clothes you don't remember putting on—rough-woven fabric, primitive but practical. When you kneel at the water's edge, your reflection stares back at you, but something is subtly different about your face, as if you've been here longer than just this moment.

As you cup the cold water to your lips, you notice carved symbols on nearby stones. They're not from any alphabet you recognize, yet somehow their meaning tickles at the edge of your understanding. 

Then you hear voices approaching through the trees—speaking a language that shouldn't make sense, but does. They haven't seen you yet. You have seconds to decide: reveal yourself to these people, or hide and observe first?

**What do you do?**
