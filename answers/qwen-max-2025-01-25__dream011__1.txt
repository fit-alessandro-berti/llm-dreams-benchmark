completely unfamiliar. The words on the page seem to shift and blur, as if they're written in a language you've never seen before. You glance around the room, hoping for some clarity, but everyone else seems focused and confident, their pens moving steadily across the pages.

Panic begins to rise in your chest, but then something strange happens. A small, glowing figure appears at the edge of your desk—a creature no taller than your hand, with shimmering wings like liquid light. It leans toward you and whispers, "The answers aren't on the paper. They’re within you."

Before you can react, the exam booklet flips itself over, and instead of questions, there’s now a single mirror embedded in the page. Staring back at you is your own reflection, except it looks... different. Calmer. Stronger. Wiser. As you gaze into its eyes, memories flood your mind—moments from your life when you overcame challenges, solved problems creatively, or helped others without expecting anything in return.

Each memory feels like an answer unfolding inside you. The first question reappears on the page, and though the words still look foreign, you instinctively know what to write. Your pen glides effortlessly, filling the space with responses that feel true and profound.

But just as you finish the last question, the room begins to shake. The walls dissolve into swirling clouds, and the other students vanish one by one. The tiny winged creature flutters up to eye level and says, "This was never about the test. It's about trusting yourself."

You wake up suddenly, heart racing, only to realize you're holding a pen in your hand—and scribbled on your palm are the words: **"Trust the journey."**

What do you think this dream means?
