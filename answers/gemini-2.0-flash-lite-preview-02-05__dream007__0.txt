You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **...walk away. It’s not a dramatic, slam-the-door kind of walk away, but a slow, deliberate turn, a silent acknowledgement that the current space is no longer safe. The argument, which had been raging in a chaotic whirlwind of words, suddenly feels like a broken record stuck on repeat. I can see my friend’s face, contorted with frustration and hurt, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to focus. Everything around us, the cozy, sun-drenched café where we’d been laughing just moments before, starts to blur. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee, the gentle hum of conversation, the cheerful music playing softly in the background – all fade into a distant echo.**

**I start walking towards the door, each step feeling heavy, like wading through thick molasses. I don't say goodbye, don’t offer any final words. The silence is a choice, a desperate attempt to preserve what's left of the connection between us. As I push open the door, a gust of wind whips past, carrying with it the faint scent of rain and a chilling sense of loneliness. The outside world feels stark and unfamiliar. The normally bustling city street seems deserted, the familiar sounds replaced by a deafening quiet.**

**Then, something strange happens. The street begins to morph. The buildings around me soften, their sharp edges dissolving into swirling colors. The pavement beneath my feet transforms into a lush, green meadow, dotted with vibrant wildflowers I don't recognize. I feel a tug on my sleeve and turn to see… not my friend, but a small, luminous creature with iridescent wings, hovering beside me. It doesn’t speak, but its presence radiates a sense of peace, a gentle reassurance that everything will be alright. A path opens up before me, leading away from the blurred café and into this fantastical landscape, and I begin to follow it, drawn forward by an unseen force. The weight of the argument, the hurt, the unanswered words – they slowly begin to dissipate, replaced by a growing sense of wonder and a quiet hope for a resolution, somewhere, somehow.**
