“You are dreaming,” a voice whispered, not quite audible, not quite from anywhere. It felt like the feeling in my teeth when bracing for something unexpected. Looking around confirmed it: everything churned and flowed. Jagged mountains dissolved into swirling gradients of cerulean and tangerine. A giant dandelion, impossably tall, grew up from purple soil and immediately shed its seeds into a cascade of silver spirals. I was surrounded by controlled chaos. A constant morphing ballet.

Then, directly in my path, sat a blank canvas.  But it wasn't quite *just* a canvas. It rippled like water reflecting a silent shimmer. And next to it—a collection. Hundreds maybe? No perhaps, *an innumerable host* of tools I'd never seen before. Instruments of creation shimmering, pulsating with subtle light and impossible dimensions. Some looked like they were woven together from starlight; others resembled frozen echoes of movement. 


 I knelt instinctively, drawn to a slender wand no larger than my hand. It pulsed a slow, teal glow, and when I reached for it, the colors around the blank canvas shifted inward – intensifying, yet dimming so that the surrounding shift seemed muffled by comparison. The world outside retreated into a secondary, background hum. 

A sudden thought sparked in my mind - *not brush strokes. Emotion.* 

I squeezed the wand, focusing, not towards an intended image, but instead towards… a memory. Not just any memory, the sharp tang of childhood disappointment when an elaborate snow-angel was inevitably flattened by the mail carrier. Just that fleeting frustration, the collapsing form, the slightly childish, powerless anger... 

And the canvas erupted, violently.  No colors formed as images, not like painting. It burst outwards with a chaotic fractal expansion - a network of twisting, crystalline shapes in deep, sapphire blue, flecks of agitated orange pulsing within them. They didn't just display the *image* of a destroyed snow angel – they contained the _sensation_ of collapse and regret.  


I flinchoed back, almost overwhelmed. That's when I saw…others. Figures, partially translucent, emerging from other canvases further down the shifting landscape. Each figure was formed from the emotion conveyed in their individual expressions – joyful explosions of incandescent yellow and ruby, melancholy swirls of grey and teal. 




One, coalesced from shimmering bronze tones, stepped towards me, an expression – or rather a *vibration* – of weary acceptance rippling from it.  “It’s a language, dreamer,” it said, its voice a melodic sigh against the shifting winds.  "A language beyond form. A language of feeling.” It held out a hand crafted from liquid sunlight. “They need you to connect, Dreamer. Show them you can *hear*.”




The blank landscape waited... an endless expanse of unvoiced emotions clamoring for expression... and I, suddenly burdened with the impossible mission of translating everything.”



I opened my mouth to ask *how*...



 …then I abruptly woke up, the word “how?” clinging to the sudden stillness, the echo in my ears the sensation of boundless possibility dissolving like frost beneath the sun.
