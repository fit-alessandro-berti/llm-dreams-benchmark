You begin to speak, and the words don’t stay neatly in your mouth—they rise up like silver moths and settle on the crowd, each person catching a line that feels tailor-made for them. The stage breathes; the floor tilts and then steadies, as if the room itself is listening. The microphone hums a soft note and morphs into a compass that points toward the back of the hall. When you say your first real sentence, you realize you’re using a dream voice: imperfect, intimate, fearless. The speech becomes a conversation with the audience, not a performance you’re delivering but a map you’re sharing.

Faces soften into landscapes—faces you know, strangers you’ve never met—until the crowd feels like a chorus rather than an audience. The words rearrange themselves into little gifts: “Ask for help,” “Try again,” “Be kind to your own mistakes.” The room fills with a gentle wind that carries your phrases to every corner, and the edges of the stage blur into a horizon where the ceiling dissolves into stars.

You step closer to the edge of the platform, and the curtain behind you ripples open like a doorway. Beyond it, a garden of doors waits: one labeled Courage, another Curiosity, a third Kindness. You reach for Courage, open the door, and step through. The moment you do, the crowd erupts—not with loud applause but with a warm, resonant cheer that feels like it’s coming from inside you, lifting you up as if you were floating.

And then you wake, smiling at how your dream gave you a voice you didn’t know you had, ready to speak truthfully whenever you choose.
