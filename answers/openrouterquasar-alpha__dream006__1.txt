speak, but the words feel tangled in your mouth. The microphone suddenly melts like wax, dripping through your fingers. Glancing down, you realize you’re barefoot, standing ankle-deep in a shallow pool of shimmering water that’s appeared from nowhere. The audience begins to ripple and blur, their faces shifting like reflections on the water’s surface. You take a deep breath, and as you find your voice, the scene transforms — the auditorium walls dissolve into a vast, starlit night, where your words float upward, becoming constellations. Calm washes over you as you continue, your voice echoing confidently across the infinite sky.
