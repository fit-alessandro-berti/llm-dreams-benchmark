...written not in ink, but in shifting constellations of light that pulse softly on the page. Each question rearranges itself the moment you try to focus—letters dissolving into starlight, numbers blooming into origami birds that flutter just out of reach.  

The proctor, a woman with eyes like twin eclipses, leans over your desk. Her voice hums like distant radio static: *“The exam isn’t about answers. It’s about what you’re willing to unlearn.”*  

You glance around. Other students aren’t writing—they’re folding their test papers into paper boats, releasing them onto a sudden river flooding the classroom floor. The water is warm, smelling of rain and old library books. One boat brushes your ankle, and you see your own childhood handwriting on its hull: *“Why do grown-ups forget how to wonder?”*  

The final question stabilizes before you, glowing steady and silver:  
**“What will you sacrifice to become who you’re meant to be?”**  

Your pen hovers. Outside the window, the sky cracks open like an egg, spilling dawn over everything.  

*(You wake with your hand still clutching the pen. The exam paper on your desk is blank. But your palm is stained with stardust.)*
