As you approach, the canvas does not lie flat—it hovers, trembling like a bubble of stillness in the river of shifting forms. The world around you melts into softer edges: emerald spirals soften to lavender mist, angular mountains sigh into rolling hills of mother-of-pearl.

You reach out. Your fingertips do not touch a surface, but *pass through*—into a space that is cool and silent and utterly empty. Not blank like paper, but blank like a paused breath. And then, from the center, a single line appears. It is not drawn—it *unfolds*, a filament of silver light that coils and knots itself into a shape that is neither circle nor square, but something that feels like the echo of a memory you’ve never had.

The line multiplies. Not with your will, but with the world’s. The colors outside the canvas—the churning cerulean, the flickering amber—begin to *seep* into the frame, not as paint, but as living texture. A bloom of coral becomes a floating archipelago within the canvas. A streak of gold hardens into a bridge that arches to nowhere.

You realize the canvas is not a portal *to* this world. It is a **mirror** of its soul—capturing not what is, but what *could be*. And as you watch, the shapes you’ve seen in the shifting landscape begin to settle *inside* the frame, finding a coherence they never had in the real. The chaos is being given a home.

Then, the canvas turns its face toward you. Not a face, but a *question* in luminous form. It waits. Not for you to paint, but for you to *name* what you see. And as your lips part to speak the first word, the entire dream holds its breath—the colors pausing mid-shift, the shapes hovering, suspended, waiting for your sound to give them final form.

What do you name the shape on the canvas?
