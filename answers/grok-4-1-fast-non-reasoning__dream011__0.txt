You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are all written in ancient runes that shift and morph like living tattoos on the page. Panic rises as you realize the proctor is your childhood pet goldfish, now a stern professor in a tiny tweed suit, glaring at you through comically oversized glasses.

You scribble frantic answers anyway—poems about quantum pizza, equations for folding socks perfectly—but the runes rewrite themselves into riddles: "What walks on four legs in the morning, flies on two at noon, and juggles flaming chainsaws at night?" Your pencil turns to spaghetti mid-sentence, splattering marinara across the desk.

Suddenly, the room warps into a vast library floating in zero gravity. Books flap like angry birds, quoting Shakespeare in pig Latin. You grab one titled *The Answer Is Always 42*, but it explodes into confetti that reassembles as a mirror showing your future self: a billionaire astronaut-pirate riding a unicorn through a candy nebula.

The goldfish proctor booms, "Time's up! Your grade is... delicious!" You wake up drenched in sweat, pencil in hand, only to find your real alarm clock blinking: "Ace the interview today. You've got this."
