The first thing that hits you isnâ€™t sightâ€”itâ€™s *smell*. Woodsmoke thick as smoke, sour milk, damp earth, and something sharp beneath it all: sweat and raw meat. Your eyes snap open to a world of rough-hewn timber, thatch roofs, and mud-streaked cobblestones underfoot. No streetlights. No hum of electricity. Just the guttural roar of a crow from a skeletal oak and the distant clatter of hooves on stone.  

Youâ€™re standing in a market square, but itâ€™s *wrong*. Clothes are coarse wool and linen. Faces are lined with exhaustion, cheekbones sharp as knife edges. A woman in a faded headscarf stirs a pot of murky stew over an open fire, her breath tightening in the cold morning air. Someone yells in a language thatâ€™s half-familiar, half-alienâ€”Old English? Middle High German? The words claw at your ears like static.  

*You need to find shelter before dusk.*  
*You need to eat something.*  
*You need to understand whereâ€”and *when*â€”you are.*  

A skeletal dog roots through a pile of refuse. You stumble toward a stone bakery, its oven glowing faintly through the door. A baker presses a small loaf into the hands of a man in a tunic patterned with faded embroidery. *Nobles*. The thought makes your chest tighten. Youâ€™re in ragsâ€”your modern jeans and jacket gone, replaced by rough-spun cloth that smells of sweat and mildew.  

A hand clutches your arm. Itâ€™s an old woman, her eyes milky white with cataracts. "Stranger," she rasps, her breath hot and sour. "The master of the manor seeks workers. Orâ€¦ *witches*." Her grip tightens, knuckles bone-white. "They found another in the north wood last week. Hanged for summoning storms."  

Your pulse hammers. *Hanged*. This isnâ€™t an amusement park reenactment. This is 13th-century England. Maybe earlier. You remember nowâ€”the taste of fear in your dream last night, the one where you couldnâ€™t breathe. Itâ€™s not a dream *now*.  

You glance at the baker. Heâ€™s watching you, his expression unreadable. Lead in your stomach. You need bread. You need a story. You need to move *fast* before the masterâ€™s men see youâ€”your clothes, your skin (untanned, untouched by fieldwork), your *eyes* (too clear, too modern).  

As you take a shaky step toward the bakerâ€™s stall, a child trips over a barrel, scattering turnips. The old woman laughs, a dry, rattling sound. "Go. Before they see you see *them*."  

You do.  
But where?  

And why are you here?  

The crow caws againâ€”once, twiceâ€”from the tower of a distant keep. It sounds like a question.  

*(The dream fades. You wake to your own room, sunlight on your pillow. But your hands still smell of woodsmoke. And your phone? Gone. Just a stack of ancient-looking field notes on the nightstand, written in a hand you donâ€™t recognize.)* ðŸ˜´
