...decide to **walk away, but not in anger**. The words hang heavy in the air, unspoken but echoing in the sudden silence. My chest aches with the unsaid, the frustration twisting into a knot. Instead of shouting, instead of letting the hurt boil over, I turn and walk towards the ocean. The sand is cool beneath my bare feet, a stark contrast to the heat that still simmers within me. 

The waves crash against the shore, a rhythmic roar that slowly begins to drown out the echo of our argument.  My friend doesn't follow. I don't expect them to. We both need space, a chance to let the raw emotions settle before they solidify into resentment. 

As I walk, the dream shifts. The ocean transforms into a vast, star-dusted field of lavender. Each flower sways gently in a nonexistent breeze, their fragrance calming the turmoil within me.  I realize that walking away wasn't about giving up, but about choosing a different path, a path that leads towards understanding rather than conflict. 

Suddenly, a figure appears beside me. It's not my friend, but a wise, old woman with eyes that twinkle like distant stars. She smiles, a knowing, comforting smile, and hands me a single lavender bloom. "Sometimes," she says, her voice a gentle whisper, "silence speaks louder than words. Let the fragrance remind you of the love that remains, even in disagreement." 

I take the flower, its scent filling my senses, and as I do, I know that our friendship, though tested, will survive. We will find our way back to each other, not through force, but through the quiet understanding that blossoms in the space between words.
