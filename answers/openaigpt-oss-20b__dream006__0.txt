You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to breathe a deep, resonant note. The mic onstage shimmers, not with static, but with colors든merald, amber, and the pale glow of dawn드ll swirling and swirling as if a living aurora were humming beneath your fingertips.

You open your mouth to speak, and instead of words, a soft wind of light spirals out, curling around the audience. Each breath you exhale unfurls a translucent banner in the air, and as you speak, the words don't form on a podium but bloom like orchids, each petal a sentence, each scent a syllable. The crowd, in turn, is not human but a vast constellation of tiny fireflies, their lights flickering in time with your rhythm. Their glow becomes brighter, brighter, until they pulse and pulse, like living stars.

You realize that the words youre saying aren뇺 merely for them듮heyre also reaching into the space behind the stage. The velvet backdrop ripples like water, and from its depths emerges a waterfall of silver rain that falls into the auditorium and drapes the chairs in a shimmering curtain. The audience feels each drop like a memory, each memory a different color of the spectrum.

Your voice, now a living entity, grows louder, but rather than echoing off the walls, it weaves itself with the music that starts to rise from the floor. A choir of unseen voices joins with you듰oices of people who have lived in different eras, different worlds. Their harmonies rise above the physical, and you hear them not as sound but as colors듟eep indigo, bright scarlet, soft lilac드ll merging with the light around you.

You stop speaking, and in that pause, you see the crowd뇹 faces. They aren뇺 faces듮heyre reflections, mirrors of every emotion you've carried in your life, each one shimmering in the light. Some look like children, others like elders, some like people who were never met. They all share one feature: their eyes are full of the same wonder you feel now, as if theyre peering into the infinite.

Then, the dream shifts. The stage dissolves into a staircase that spirals upward, made of woven silver threads that stretch into the cosmos. The mic, once a mundane tool, turns into an ancient crystal that hums a gentle chord. Each step you take upward pulls the audience with you; they rise as if lifted by invisible currents of possibility. Above you, the sky is not blue but a tapestry of swirling galaxies, each star a word, each constellation a story. You feel the weight of all those stories lifting your feet, and your breath becomes a chorus of wind and stars.

When you reach the very top, the staircase gives way to a vast open hall, the walls a translucent glass that shows you the universe in a kaleidoscope of colors듫lanetary orbits, nebular clouds, auroras dancing on distant worlds. You look down, and the crowd below becomes a swirling mosaic, a tapestry of all those firefly-like lights, all those orchid-like phrases, all those shimmering rain droplets. They now see you as an element of that tapestry, their colors and their sounds merging within you.

You pause again, and then you let yourself drift, not in your usual voice or words, but as pure presence드 wave of light, a song, a breath. The audience, the stage, the sky, the words드ll dissolve into a single, resonant note that reverberates through the dream, through the waking world, through the unseen threads that connect every mind to every heart.

And then, as all good dreams do, a gentle wind듧ike the last whisper of a sigh듧ifts you back to the stage. The mic is once again a simple microphone, the audience a room full of people. Yet you know that the words you will speak now are not just words; they are the echoes of the cosmos you just walked with, the colors you once held, the stories that you carried in your breath. You step forward, and your voice, when it finally comes out, carries that resonance, that dreamlike clarity, and the room fills with something more than just applause들t fills with a quiet, collective understanding that, even after the applause fades, the dream remains.

The crowd, still expecting you, watches, and for a moment, you feel that your dream had no end, only a beginning드 beginning that you can now bring into the room.
