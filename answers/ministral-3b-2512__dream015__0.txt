**Dream Continuation:**

You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world where the sky is a bruised twilight—ash and smoke clinging to the horizon like a forgotten stain. The air smells of rust and damp earth, the scent of something long dead. The ruins of cities loom ahead, their skeletal spires clawing at the sky, their once-grand facades now crumbling into dust. But you’re not alone—you’ve stumbled upon a small, tight-knit group of survivors huddled around a flickering fire in the ruins of what was once a library. Their faces are gaunt, their eyes sharp with hunger and survival.

One of them—a woman with a scar running from her temple to her jawline—turns to you, her voice rough but weary. *"You’re new. Where’d you come from?"* She gestures to the horizon, where the last remnants of civilization flicker like dying embers. *"We’ve been waiting for someone who knows how to find water. Or firewood. Or anything that won’t get us shot."*

You realize then that you’ve been tracking something—or someone—through the ruins. A faint, rhythmic *clinking* echoes from the distance, like metal against metal. Your fingers twitch toward your belt, where a rusted pocketknife and a tattered map are tucked away. The map is faded, but the lines leading toward a place called *"The Hollow"* are still legible. And the *clinking*… it sounds like it’s coming from the Hollow.

A shadow stretches long across the ground as a figure emerges from the ruins—a boy no older than twelve, his clothes patched together from scavenged scraps. He’s holding a broken radio, its screen flickering with static. *"They’re coming,"* he whispers. *"The ones who don’t want survivors. They’re hunting the Hollow."*

The woman’s grip tightens on her knife. *"Then we move fast. But we can’t go alone."*

You look at the boy, then at the group, then back at the Hollow. The air hums with tension, with possibility. The world is broken, but so are you. And for the first time in a long time, you don’t feel like you’re just surviving.

You feel like you’re *choosing*.

**What happens next?**
- Do you lead the group toward the Hollow, risking the hunters?
- Do you try to find a safer path, but the map leads you deeper into the ruins?
- Or does something else—an old enemy, a forgotten secret—pull you in a different direction?
