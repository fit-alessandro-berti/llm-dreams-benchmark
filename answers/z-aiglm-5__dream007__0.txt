You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to—

—step backward. Just one step. Your heel finds a patch of grass that wasn't there a moment ago. The kitchen floor has become a hillside at dusk, all purple shadow and cricket song, and your friend is still standing in the doorway, which now frames nothing but sky.

You realize you cannot remember what you were fighting about. The anger is still in your chest, but when you reach for its shape, your fingers close on air.

Your friend says something. From here, it sounds like water moving over stones. You watch their mouth make the shapes of old arguments, old wounds, old love. The words dissolve before they reach you, and what lands instead is just tone. Just ache. Just the pure animal want to be understood.

You want to explain this. You open your mouth.

Instead of words, a small blue bird flies out.

Then another. And another. A whole flock of them pouring from your throat in a rush of wings and heartbeat, filling the space between you. Your friend staggers backward, and the doorway becomes a window becomes a mirror, and in the mirror, you see yourself from a distance—someone younger, someone older, someone whose face is obscured by birds.

The argument is everywhere and nowhere. It was always about this: the inability to cross the distance between two minds.

You wake with tears on your face and the sense that you've traveled very far.

The dream leaves behind a single image: blue feathers on your pillow.
