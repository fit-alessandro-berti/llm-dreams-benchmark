Of course. Here is a completion of that dream:

The air, once sweet with the scent of pine and damp earth, turns sharp and metallic. The gentle rustle of leaves escalates into a frantic whispering, as if the trees themselves are sharing a fearful secret. A deep, guttural rumble echoes in the distance, not from the sky above, but from the very heart of the forest.

The light shifts from a dappled green to an eerie, jaundiced yellow. The wind whips through the canopy, tearing leaves from their branches and sending them spiraling in chaotic vortices. You quicken your pace, your heart beginning to hammer a rhythm that matches the escalating wind.

A fork in the path appears ahead. To the left, the trail leads down into a dark, mist-shrouded ravine. To the right, it ascends a rocky hill where a single, immense oak tree stands silhouetted against the bruised purple sky.

Another rumble, closer this time, shakes the ground beneath your feet. It’s not thunder. It sounds more like… breathing.

As the first cold, heavy raindrops begin to fall, a figure emerges from the shadows of the ravine. It is tall and slender, seemingly woven from the storm itself—a wisp of dark mist, with eyes that flash like lightning. It doesn't move toward you, but simply points a long, ethereal finger down the dark path.

A simultaneous crack of lightning splits the sky, illuminating the hilltop. For a fraction of a second, you see a small, warm light—like a lantern or a candle—flickering in a hollow at the base of the great oak. It promises shelter.

The choice is yours. The storm is here. The wind howls, the figure waits, and the light on the hill beckons.

What do you do?
