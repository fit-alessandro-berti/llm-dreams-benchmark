You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to **tremble, your heart pounding in your chest, the weight of the moment crashing over you**. The stage is vast, lit with soft, golden halos, and the silence before your voice breaks the stillness. You clutch the podium, your fingers gripping the metal like a lifeline, as your mind races with imagined doubts—*What if I mess it up? What if the audience judges me?*  

But then, a slow, deliberate breath fills your lungs. You close your eyes, inhaling deeply, and allow the tension to ebb. The crowd’s expectant gaze is not a threat but a blessing, a silent chorus of encouragement. You let the words flow, not fearing the audience’s judgment, but the *message* itself. You speak with conviction, your voice rising and falling like a tide, and as the first words spill out, the stage seems to dissolve, replaced by a sea of eyes—all listening, all waiting.  

When you finish, the silence is thunderous, not empty, but filled with *understanding*. The audience’s collective breath holds, and in that stillness, you feel a surge of clarity. Your fears had been a construct, a mirage. You stand there, not as a stranger to your own power, but as the embodiment of your own courage. The lights fade, and suddenly, you’re not just speaking—you’re *alive*.  

You step down, the crowd’s cheers echoing in your ears, and as the final note of your speech lingers in the air, you realize: **you’ve always been the speaker.**
