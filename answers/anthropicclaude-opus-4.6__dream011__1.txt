# The Dream

You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are **written in a language you've never seen before.**

Not quite symbols, not quite letters — they shift and shimmer on the page like living things, rearranging themselves every time you try to focus. Your heart hammers. You glance around the lecture hall. Everyone else is writing furiously, their pens scratching in confident rhythm, as if this all makes perfect sense.

You look back down. The first question has settled, momentarily, into something almost readable:

**"Describe the architecture of a door you haven't opened yet."**

Your pen touches the paper — and you realize you're not writing words. You're drawing a map. It flows out of you involuntarily, a place you somehow recognize: corridors branching like veins, rooms nested inside rooms, a garden at the center where something is growing.

The second question pulses:

**"What is the weight of a choice you haven't made?"**

The paper feels heavier. The desk begins to sink slowly into the floor. No one else notices.

You flip to the last page. There's only one line, and this time, it's perfectly clear:

**"Who told you this was an exam?"**

You look up. The other students are gone. The proctor's chair is empty. The lecture hall walls have dissolved into an open sky, and the desk beneath your hands has become warm earth.

The map you drew is no longer on paper. It's the landscape stretching out in every direction around you.

And somewhere ahead — past the corridors, past the unopened door — you hear something calling your name in a voice that sounds exactly like your own.

You stand up. The exam is over.

*The dream hasn't decided yet what happens when you start walking.*
