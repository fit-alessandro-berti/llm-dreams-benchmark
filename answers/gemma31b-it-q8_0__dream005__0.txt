…they all turn away as soon as they notice me. A wave of anxiety rises through me, like static buzzing just underneath my skin. My palms are clammy, my teeth are clenched tight. Then I see them. 

Slowly, deliberately, they start to converge on a cluster of people meticulously arranging a miniature, intricately carved willow tree in the grass. There’s an old woman with silver hair pulled tight, weaving tiny wooden birds into the branches. Beside her, a young boy meticulously smooths a crimson maple leaf with a tiny, bone-handled brush. And further back, a collection of antique diving helmets, covered in dust, stand silent sentinel.

As I cautiously drift closer, one of the old woman’s birds, a robin perched precariously on a twig, subtly tilts its head towards me. It *doesn’t* fly away. They keep the distance. 

I try to speak, the word feeling thick and clumsy. “Elara?”  It feels absurd, like a plea directed at a particularly stubborn weed. 

Suddenly, the boy, all focused on his leaves, looks up, his eyes - startlingly blue - fixed on me.  He doesn’t speak. Instead, he slowly, precisely, moves a small, perfectly mirrored stone from the base of the willow tree, positioning it just to the right of my chest. 

It isn’t a gesture of welcome. It’s a…reflection. A shimmering, distorted version of *me* appearing momentarily, a fleeting echo of the feeling I have – of a sadness, vast and profound, echoing in this room.  Then, he quickly gathers the stone and resumes his leaf work, seemingly oblivious.

As I feel myself being submerged in a thick, purple mist - familiar, somehow - and the air starts to taste of ozone and old paper.  I realise this isn't going anywhere. This isn't *anyone* I know. 

A single voice, carried on a strange breeze (or maybe it’s just a feeling), whispers, "We were expecting you to remember." 

Then, a single, perfect white rose, larger than my head, appears in the middle of the willow tree, and its thorns gently brush against my cheek.  A small, intricately detailed key slides out from the rose.  The room seems to dissolve... and the feeling of *wanting* to know her… intensifies sharply before everything becomes a blinding, echoing white. 

Was that...?
