Oh no problem! I understand it can be frustrating to feel like we're not progressing according to our plan. My advice here is to focus on why your goal matters to you and what you've achieved so far. Celebrate your accomplishments because they're important! Sometimes when there's a setback, it's how you respond that matters more than the outcome itself. Keep dreaming big and don't forget to stay strong! You can also try practicing mindfulness in between each round of challenges, breathing deeply and focusing on positive thoughts.
