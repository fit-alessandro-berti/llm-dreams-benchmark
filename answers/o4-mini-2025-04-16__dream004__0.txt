You reach out, brush trembling between your fingers, and touch the blank canvas. At first, nothing happens—but then the tip of your brush dissolves into liquid light, dripping vibrant cerulean onto the white expanse. With each stroke, the canvas ripples, sending waves of color pulsing out into the air around you. Mountains of molten emerald rise and fall in response to your motions; flowers of spun-gold bloom at your feet. You realize the painting isn’t just a picture—it’s a portal.

As you paint, the world around you warps to match your creation. A cobalt sky folds in on itself, folding into the canvas’s horizon. Jagged crimson crystals sprout from the ground, humming with energy borrowed from the new landscape you’re weaving. You hesitate, then—half in wonder, half in fear—swipe in a single bold line of midnight black. Instantly, a void opens beneath your toes, and you step through.

On the other side, gravity relents. You drift freely in an endless hall of mirrors, each reflecting different versions of your canvas: one shows a sun made of glass, another a sea of dancing polygons, a third a forest where the trees are ribbons of glowing ink. You move from one mirror to the next, curious which reflection is “real.” But every time you reach out, the mirror shimmers and reshapes itself, beckoning you to paint further, to invent again.

Finally, you find yourself before a tiny mirror no larger than your palm. In it, you see not the surreal panorama, but your own eyes staring back. You lift your hand and—almost instinctively—brush a single stroke across the glass. The mirror cracks, and the shards scatter like shooting stars. In that instant, you awaken: back in your bed, dawn’s light filtering through the curtains. But on your bedside table, the tiny mirror shard still glows faintly with the colors you painted—proof that your dreamscape follows you, refusing to stay behind.
