panic slightly as the time ticks by. The streets are bustling with people who seem to know exactly where they're going, while you feel like a lost soul wandering through this labyrinthine metropolis. Buildings tower above you, their architecture blending elements of the ancient and the futuristic, with neon lights flickering in strange patterns that seem to shift and change as you watch.

You stop at a crossroads, unsure of which way to go. Just then, an elderly woman with a kind face approaches you. She wears a long, flowing robe that seems to shimmer with an inner light, and her eyes sparkle with wisdom. She gestures toward one of the paths and says, "Follow your heart, but remember, the answer lies within."

Confused yet intrigued, you thank her and start down the chosen path. As you walk, the buildings around you begin to change, transforming into something more familiar—like a memory from long ago, but not quite right. The streets narrow, and you notice small details that seem out of place: a vendor selling flowers that look like they belong in a different era, a sign in an ancient language that somehow makes sense to you, and a sound that feels like laughter, but it's distant, almost haunting.

Suddenly, you hear a faint voice calling your name. It's not loud, but it's clear and urgent. You follow the sound and find yourself standing in front of an old, weathered building that doesn't match the modern architecture around it. The door creaks open as you approach, and inside, the room is dimly lit with soft, golden light. In the center stands a clock, its hands frozen at the time you first arrived in the city.

You walk closer, and the voice calls again, louder this time. You turn around and see a young man standing behind you, his expression a mix of urgency and relief. He looks like you, but younger, and he says, "We need to hurry. The meeting is here."

Before you can ask how he knows this, the room starts to blur and shift. The walls dissolve into a swirling mass of colors, and you feel yourself being pulled forward. The young man grabs your hand, and together, you run through the shifting space, the voices of the city fading behind you until all you can hear is each other's breath.

Finally, the world stabilizes, and you find yourselves in a large, elegant hall. People are already gathered, and the meeting is about to begin. You sit down, and the room fills with a sense of calm, as if everything has been leading up to this moment. The young man smiles at you, and you realize, with a start, that it's you from the future.

The meeting begins, and as you listen, you understand that this dream is not just about finding a location; it's about realizing that the answers you seek are not outside of you, but within.
