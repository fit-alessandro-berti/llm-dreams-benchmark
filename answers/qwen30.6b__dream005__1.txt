As you trace the familiar shadows at the edge of the dance floor, the air hums with the quiet tension of a meeting room where faces glow like stars. The group shifts like whispers, some laughing at the way you stand apart, others clapping in unison. You glance up and find the stranger—you know them—already in hand. They lean closer, their voice a lullaby. "This room... here..." they say, eyes searching yours. You smile, and they nod. You leave with a grin, knowing the world beyond your small world is brighter than any dream.
