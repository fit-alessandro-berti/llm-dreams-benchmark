You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **figure out where and when you are, and how on earth you're going to survive without knowing the rules of this place.**

The air smells different – woodsmoke, damp earth, animals. The sounds are unfamiliar – the clang of a blacksmith, distant shouts, the clip-clop of hooves. The few people you see wear clothes that seem straight out of a history book, or perhaps a historical drama. Your own clothes feel like a ridiculous costume. Panic starts to bubble beneath the surface of the dream logic. You don't know the language, the currency, the customs, or even if the water is safe to drink. Every glance you receive feels like scrutiny. You need to find shelter, acquire appropriate clothing, and somehow communicate, all while trying not to look like a complete lunatic or a threat. The most pressing need isn't just food or water, but **information**, a map of this terrifying, beautiful, silent world.
