You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to…

The lights dim, then flare up in a chorus of colors that have no name—amber that tastes like sunrise, cobalt that hums like a distant train, emerald that smells of rain on dry earth. The audience isn’t made of people at all, but of shadows that flicker in rhythm with your pulse. Each one bears a tiny lantern, flickering uncertainly, as if trying to read the constellations written on your skin.

You open your mouth, and instead of sound, a thin thread of silver light pours out, weaving itself into the air. It snakes between the heads of the crowd, touching each lantern and causing them to glow brighter for a heartbeat before dimming again. The light doesn’t merely illuminate; it translates. In its glow, you see the faces of strangers you’ve never met—an elderly woman knitting a scarf made of starlight, a child balancing a glass ball filled with swirling clouds, a man in a suit whose tie is a river that flows upward.

With each visual translation, a word forms, not in any language you know but in a tongue that lives in the marrow of your bones:

*“We are not here to be heard. We are here to remember what we have forgotten.”*

The words echo not through ears but through the very marrow of the audience’s chests. The crowd—those shadow‑people—begin to move as one. Their lanterns lift, rising like fireflies caught in a gentle wind. They drift toward you, forming a spiraling vortex of light and memory. As they approach, you feel the weight of centuries pressing against your ribs: the rustle of ancient scrolls, the metallic clang of a distant forge, the soft sigh of a lullaby sung to a child who never existed.

Your voice, now a liquid cascade of those silver threads, carries with it the scent of a coffee shop on a rainy street and the taste of pine needles underfoot. It carries the laughter of siblings who grew up on the edge of cliffs, and the quiet resolve of a soldier who never saw battle. It is every unsaid apology, every whispered secret, every unspoken love threading through the fabric of the room.

And then, as the vortex reaches its apex, the stage itself begins to melt. Wooden planks dissolve into rivers of ink, and the ceiling drips with constellations that rearrange themselves into stories you have lived and stories you have yet to write. The audience—no longer observers—becomes a part of those stories, their lanterns now burning with the colors of your memories.

You step forward, not to speak, but to step into the river of ink, feeling the coolness of each droplet as it slides over your skin. In that moment, you understand that the speech was never about delivering a message to others; it was about allowing those others to see the fragments of yourself that you have been too afraid to voice.

When the last droplet settles, the crowd erupts—not in applause, but in a soft, collective exhalation that ripples through the hall like a sigh. The shadows dissolve into fine, glittering dust that settles on the floor, forming a mosaic of every face you have ever known. You close your eyes, and the final line of the dream settles into your mind:

*“Every speech is a mirror; every audience is a fragment of you, waiting to be reflected back.”*

You open your eyes to find yourself standing not on a stage, but on a quiet shore where the sea meets a sky painted with the same impossible colors you first saw on the stage. The tide rolls in, carrying with it a single, luminous word written in phosphorescent foam: **“Begin.”** The dream does not end; it simply shifts, as dreams do, into the next horizon you have yet to imagine.
