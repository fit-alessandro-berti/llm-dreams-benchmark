You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and **the air thickens, heavy with the scent of ozone and damp earth. The gentle rustling of leaves is abruptly silenced, replaced by a profound, expectant hush.**

**The sunlight, moments before dappled and warm, is completely extinguished. A bruised, greenish-purple light washes over the canopy, making the familiar greens of the moss and ferns look alien and sickly. You instinctively stop, the soft earth beneath your feet suddenly feeling unstable.**

**Then, it begins. Not with a gentle rain, but with massive, cold drops that hit the forest floor like flung pebbles. Within seconds, the drops become a torrential downpour, so dense you can barely see ten feet in front of you. The sound is deafening—a roar of water hammering the leaves, turning the forest floor into a churning, muddy stream.**

**But the rain isn't the frightening part. As you try to find shelter under a vast, ancient oak, you realize the wind isn't blowing *through* the trees; the wind seems to be *part* of the trees. The branches don't just sway; they writhe, twisting into impossible, black silhouettes against the flashing, strobe-like bursts of lightning. The lightning isn't coming from the clouds above, however. It seems to be originating from the *roots* of the trees, shooting up in silent, terrifying blue-white arcs that illuminate strange, luminous fungi growing on the bark.**

**You try to run, but your feet are sinking deeper into the mud with every step. You look down and see that the mud is not just mud—it’s a swirling tapestry of iridescent insects, their tiny, panicked bodies contributing to the thick, viscous texture. A low, resonant humming begins to vibrate through the ground, a sound too deep for your ears to process fully, but which rattles your bones. It’s not the sound of the storm; it’s the sound of the *forest* awakening.**

**Just as you are about to be swallowed by the rising flood, you look up one last time. Through a momentary break in the deluge, you see the canopy not as leaves, but as thousands of closed, glowing eyes, all focused directly on you. And then, the humming stops. The rain cuts off instantly, leaving a silence more terrifying than the noise. You are standing perfectly dry in a patch of impossible, deep violet light, and a single, perfect, translucent feather drifts down from the high canopy to land softly on your outstretched hand.**
