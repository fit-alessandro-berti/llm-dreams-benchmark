a shimmering, translucent brush that seems to be made of liquid light. It hovers in the air, waiting.

You reach out and take it. The moment your fingers touch the handle, a profound understanding washes over you: this canvas is not for painting *on*, but for painting *with*. It is a window, a filter, a reality-editor.

You dip the brush into the swirling, chaotic sky, and it comes away dripping with a color that doesn't have a name—a hue that smells like nostalgia and sounds like a distant chime. You touch the brush to the canvas.

Instead of leaving a mark, the canvas absorbs the color and then projects it outward. The monochrome, geometric hill in front of you suddenly blooms with soft, velvety purple grass, and the air fills with the scent of lavender and damp earth.

Emboldened, you swipe the brush across the canvas in a great, arcing curve. Instantly, a river of liquid silver carves its way through the landscape, its flow not governed by gravity but by the melody of a silent song only you can hear. You dab the brush, and trees made of crystalline light sprout along the riverbank, their leaves tinkling like wind chimes.

You are not just an observer in this dream. You are its composer. You paint a second, smaller sun, a cool, blue orb that casts deep, velvety shadows. You add a creature with too many legs and kind eyes, which scurries into the new forest. You even paint a door on the side of a floating, inverted mountain, wondering where it might lead.

For a timeless time, you play. You create waterfalls of honeyed light and clouds that rain tiny, glowing sparks. The world becomes a tapestry of your whims.

Then, you notice a corner of the canvas you haven't touched. It's no longer blank. A faint, grey smudge has appeared there, a formless, static blotch. As you watch, it slowly begins to spread, leaching the color from the edges of your creation, turning the vibrant silver river to dull lead, silencing the chime-trees.

A cold understanding dawns. The canvas is a part of *you*. The void, the emptiness, the uncharted part of your own mind is seeping in. The dream is ending.

You have one last stroke.

You look at the brush, now flickering weakly in your hand. You don't reach for a color from the world. You close your eyes and think of the feeling of wonder you had when you first picked up the brush. You pour that feeling into the brush, which glows with a fierce, warm, golden light.

With all the will you have left, you touch the brush to the center of the spreading grey.

You don't paint an object. You paint the *idea* of a beginning.

A single, golden seed appears in the center of the greyness. It pulses once, twice, and then cracks open. A brilliant, green shoot emerges, not fighting the grey, but simply being so vibrantly, stubbornly *alive* that the grey cannot touch it.

The dream dissolves around you, the colors running like watercolor in the rain. The last thing you see is that tiny, defiant green sprout, holding its own against the void.

And you know, as you wake up with the scent of lavender and the echo of chimes fading from your memory, that the next time you dream, the canvas will be waiting. And it will not be blank.
