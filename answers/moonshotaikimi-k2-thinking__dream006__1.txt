...feel the microphone dissolve into your palm like sand. The words you've prepared scatter from your mind like startled birds, but that's okay—because when you open your mouth, tiny silver fish swim out instead of syllables. They glitter in the air above the audience, each one carrying a thought you never knew you had.

The crowd doesn't clap; they bloom. Row by row, their faces become flowers turning toward you as a sun you've become, their expectant eyes now petals of every color. A woman in the front row catches one of your fish-words in her hands and it becomes a key. She smiles with recognition.

The stage beneath your feet turns to water, shallow and warm, reflecting not the auditorium but a sky full of unfamiliar stars. You realize you're not speaking to them anymore—they're all dreaming with you, breathing in unison. The speech you came to give is being written collectively in the space between your heartbeats, each pause more important than the words.

Your hands begin to glow softly, casting shadows that dance behind you like backup dancers who know the choreography of your unconscious. The final line of your speech arrives not as language, but as the taste of rain on your tongue, shared perfectly with every person in the room.

You wake up before the applause, your pillow damp with saltwater.
