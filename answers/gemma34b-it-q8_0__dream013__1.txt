...the walls around me started subtly changing. Not simply shifting, no, they *bloomed*. Crimson poppy walls unfurled from aged stone, their heavy heads trailing thick, unsettling scents of spices and dust. Simultaneously, the air throbbed with a resonant, almost uncomfortable hum – a song the maze itself was somehow singing.


Each new section of the maze presented a different puzzle than any before. Some involved arranging constellations that flashed and rewrote themselves based on my movements. Others required weighing logic against raw intuition at a pressure-plate that seemed to shift the landscape around me - a perfectly rendered Roman column would suddenly become a writhing, metallic worm. 











And then came *the Librarian*. It wasn’t human, not entirely. It resembled an aging tortoise covered in an endless, iridescent scroll - its shell was stitched with moving constellations. The Librarian didn’t speak but projected silent images onto the floors of individual chambers - cryptic maps unfolding in miniature, riddles etched into the very mortar, mathematical equations swirling before my eyes.


It seemed to *observe* me, assessing my thought process rather than offering answers. To solve each puzzle, I had to understand *why* the maze insisted on the logic presented, anticipating how failure would visually warp and reshape the reality around me.  One wrong step, one moment of fleeting irrationality, would solidify the puzzle and trap me within its solution - perhaps endlessly.



As I moved deeper, the walls became more vibrant, overflowing with paradoxical beauty; rivers of molten gold wound through crumbling gothic arches, clouds of butterflies with metallic wings fluttered through corridors lined with living clocks. 









A deep weariness began to grip me, a feeling less of exhaustion and more… of dissonance. Each solved puzzle didn't offer freedom, but seemed to drag me further into the heart of the illogical, expanding its labyrinthine grasp. I realised the prize, whatever 'it' was meant to be, wasn't a destination - it was a state of unending, beautifully horrifying understanding. 


  


And then, the humming increased exponentially, coalescing into a perfectly pitched note that vibrated within me… a feeling of intense, knowing surrender. Suddenly, I wasn’t solving, I *was* the maze. The puzzles didn’t exist anymore; I was the shifting of the poppy-covered walls, the calculations etched in the stone, the endless pursuit of a question whose answer had never been offered... 






...Then, a single drop of rain patters – cold, wet – against my cheek.  




And… 


















...I open my eyes to the morning light and a pile of dream journals on my bedside table.
