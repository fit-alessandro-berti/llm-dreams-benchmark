…and the leaves overhead begin to thrash like restless birds. The sunlight that only moments ago dappled the mossy ground is devoured by a dark, swirling bruise of cloud. Wind rushes through the trees, carrying the scent of rain and something stranger—like warm sandstone after a summer noon. You quicken your pace, but the path you thought you knew has melted into a tangle of new directions, each one glowing faintly, as if lit from beneath the roots.

A thunder‑clap splits the sky. Instead of lightning, a single silver ribbon descends, quivering in mid‑air. It hovers just ahead, humming with the distant resonance of chimes. Instinct tells you it is a doorway, or perhaps a question. You reach out, fingertips tingling, and the ribbon unfurls into a circular portal of liquid mirror. Inside it, you glimpse a beach at sunset—the ocean completely calm despite the tempest raging around you.

You step through.

Instantly the roar of wind turns to the hush of gentle surf. Behind you, the portal seals like a drop of mercury, and the forest storm becomes a silent painting in the sky. You stand upon smooth sand that glows softly from within, casting lavender light over the water. White feathers drift down from nowhere, settling on the shoreline before dissolving into tiny seashells.

In the distance you notice a lone figure: an enormous heron carved of translucent jade. Its eyes, molten gold, follow you. When you draw near, the heron dips its head and speaks without moving its beak—a clear voice inside your mind.

“Storms come so you may remember,” it says. “Remember that even thunder is just the sky teaching itself to breathe.”

You open your hands. There, resting on your palm, pulses a small, crystal-clear stone. At its center swirls a miniature tempest—tiny clouds flashing with minuscule lightning. The heron instructs: “Carry this. When waking winds rise, hold it, and you will know the calm behind every cloud.”

You nod, feeling gratitude bloom like morning light. The stone feels warm, alive. As you close your fingers around it, the lavender sand brightens until it’s impossible to distinguish light from sound. Waves, wind, feathers, thunder—they fold together into a single luminous chord.

Then silence.

You awaken in your bed, dawn spilling through the window. Outside, a gentle rain taps the glass, and in your fist you find…nothing at all—except the lingering warmth of an unseen crystal and the echo of a heron’s golden gaze, reminding you that storms, both real and remembered, can be invitations to breathe.
