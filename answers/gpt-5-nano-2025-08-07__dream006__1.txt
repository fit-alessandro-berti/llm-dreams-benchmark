You begin to speak, and the words don’t issue from your mouth so much as rise from your chest like a small sun. They spill into the air as pale ribbons, curling through the room, painting the faces of the crowd with a soft, luminous glaze. The audience tilts closer, not to judge, but to drink from the glow. The podium sprouts a single green leaf, and when you touch it the leaf unfurls into a microphone that hums with a warm, friendly vibration.

The floor under you softens and becomes a shoreline of polished wood, ending in a sea of bright silhouettes. Voices that had waited in the wings begin to hum, each one a tide-pull of memory and courage. You realize the speech is not a list of points but a key: every sentence unlocks a door inside someone else, and the doors swing inward to reveal their own tremor, their own spark.

You tell a story of a fear you once wore like a coat, and as you speak the coat dissolves into a flock of tiny birds that reassemble in the air as constellations that mirror the audience’s eyes. The ceiling blurs into a night sky, and a meteor of applause streaks across—not loud, but bright, a tide that recedes with surprising warmth.

The crowd ceases to be a crowd and becomes a single living chorus. They lean closer, listening not for perfection but for honesty. A hush settles, thick and velvet, and in that hush your voice softens into something rarer than eloquence: a call to begin again, to try, to listen, to forgive the missteps and carry on anyway.

When you reach the end, the stage reveals its last magic: the microphone sprouts wings, and the wings beat softly, carrying your final sentence into the far corners of the hall and beyond, returning as a whisper you feel in your own chest. A door—the color of dawn—appears at the back wall. It looks both like a way out and a way deeper in, and you step toward it with the audience still hovering in your periphery, as if they’re lights on a runway guiding you home.

The doors close gently, the room dims to a pearly twilight, and you sense a gentle tug at your sleeve: this dream isn’t finished yet, but you’re not fleeing it. You walk toward the door, not away from the people, carrying with you a sense that what you spoke was not a performance but an invitation: to listen, to hazard, to dare to begin again in the morning.

And then you wake, the faint taste of salt air on your lips, a small clear smile lingering, as if a secret you didn’t know you knew has just found its way into daylight.
