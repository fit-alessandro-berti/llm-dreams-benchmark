You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak, but the words tangle in your throat like wet spaghetti. Your mouth opens, and instead of eloquence, out comes a flock of tiny, iridescent butterflies that flutter into the spotlight, swirling around your head in a chaotic halo.

The audience gasps, then cheers wildly, phones flashing like a meteor shower. Emboldened, you wave your arms, and more butterflies erupt—thousands now, filling the auditorium with wings of sapphire, emerald, and gold. They form shapes in the air: hearts, dragons, your own face grinning back at you.

Panic twists into joy as the stage morphs beneath your feet into a vast, blooming meadow. The crowd leaps from their seats, joining you in a dance amid the fluttering storm. You realize this isn't a speech—it's a revolution of color and whimsy. The dream swells, boundless, until you wake with butterfly kisses on your eyelids, the echo of applause still humming in your chest.
