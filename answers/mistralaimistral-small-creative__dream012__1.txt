**The Dream Continues…**

The wind howls like a living thing, tearing at the sails with skeletal fingers. The *Black Marlin*—your ship—groans beneath the weight of the waves, her timbers straining as if she might splinter at any moment. Salt stings your eyes, but you don’t dare blink. Not now.

Your first mate, **Elias Vey**, a grizzled man with a scar running from temple to jaw, grips the wheel beside you. His knuckles are white. *"Captain,"* he shouts over the storm, *"the starboard hull’s taking on water! If we don’t turn into the wind, we’ll be swamped!"*

You know he’s right. But turning into the gale means risking the *Marlin*’s mast—already creaking like an old man’s bones. Worse, the compass in your hand spins wildly, its needle whirling as if the poles themselves have vanished.

Then you see it.

A light.

Not the sickly green of lightning, not the flicker of a drowning man’s hallucination—this is a **steady glow**, pulsing like a slow, deliberate breath. It comes from the heart of the storm, where the waves rise like black mountains, their crests foaming with an unnatural, **bioluminescent blue**.

Your crew sees it too. Some cross themselves. Others whisper of the *Drowned King’s Lantern*, a myth from the southern ports—a light that lures ships to their doom, or worse, to *something* that waits beneath the waves.

But you’ve sailed these waters long enough to know myths are just stories until they aren’t.

*"Hard to starboard!"* you bellow, and the *Marlin* lurches, her bow cutting through the swell as she turns toward the light. The crew scrambles—bailing water, securing lines, praying. The ship shudders as a wave crashes over the deck, but you stand firm, saltwater streaming from your oilskin coat.

Then the storm **parts**.

Not like clouds breaking—no, the wind itself seems to *retreat*, as if something has commanded it to still. The sea flattens into an unnatural calm, the water so smooth it might be glass. And there, floating in the center of the suddenly silent ocean, is a **ship**.

But not like any ship you’ve seen.

Her hull is **black as a shark’s hide**, her sails **tattered yet unrotted**, as if time has forgotten her. No flag flies from her mast, but the wood is carved with **symbols you don’t recognize**—twisting, living things that seem to shift when you look away. And at her prow, standing like a statue, is a **figure**.

Tall. Too tall. Wrapped in a cloak the color of storm clouds, their face hidden beneath a **hood that casts no shadow**. They raise a hand—not in greeting, but in **summons**.

A voice cuts through the silence, neither male nor female, but **both and neither**, like the tide speaking through a shell.

*"You have come far, Captain. Farther than most dare."*

Your crew is frozen. Elias’s hand drifts toward his knife, but you place a steadying palm on his shoulder. You’ve faced mutiny, leviathans, and the wrath of kings. You won’t flinch now.

*"Who are you?"* you demand, your voice steady despite the ice in your veins.

The figure tilts their head. When they speak again, their voice is **inside your skull**, vibrating in your bones.

*"I am the Keeper of the Drowning Hour. And you, Captain, have been **chosen**."*

The water around the black ship **ripples**. Then, one by one, **hands** break the surface—pale, skeletal, *alive*. Dozens of them. Hundreds. They clutch at the sides of the *Marlin*, dragging themselves up like drowned men rising from the deep.

But their faces—

Their faces are **yours**.

**What do you do, Captain?**

1. **Draw your cutlass and order the crew to fight.** *"We don’t bargain with ghosts!"*
2. **Step forward, unafraid.** *"What do you want with me?"*
3. **Whisper a prayer to the old gods of the sea.** Maybe they’ll hear. Maybe they won’t.
4. **Something else?** (Tell me your choice—this dream bends to your will.)
