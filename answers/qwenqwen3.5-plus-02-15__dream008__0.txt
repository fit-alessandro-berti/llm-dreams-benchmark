You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you **reach for your keyboard, but your hands have turned into clouds of soft, white mist. Every time you try to type, the letters float away from the screen like helium balloons, drifting up toward the fluorescent lights which have transformed into a swarm of glowing, humming butterflies.**

Your boss leans closer, but their face is a blur of static, like an old television tuned to a dead channel. "We need this by yesterday," they say, but their voice sounds like it's coming from underwater, distorted and bubbly. You try to stand up to explain, but your chair has grown roots, tangling around your legs and anchoring you to the carpet, which is now rippling like the surface of a dark ocean.

Panic flares in your chest, yet it feels distant, muffled. You look down at the project brief on your desk, and the words are rearranging themselves rapidly: *"Build a castle out of silence,"* it now reads. *"Deadline: The moment the moon cracks."*

You look out the window, expecting to see the city street, but instead, there is only a vast, starry void where a giant, crystalline moon hangs low, a visible fracture spider-webbing across its surface. As the crack widens with a sound like shattering glass, your boss finally stops speaking. They simply point at the floating letters, which have begun to descend like rain, turning into solid gold bricks as they hit the floor.

"You just have to catch them," the static-face whispers clearly for the first time. "Stack them before the moon falls."

You realize with a jolt that you aren't afraid anymore. The impossibility of the task feels natural, inevitable. You lift your misty hands, ready to catch the falling words, knowing that if you build the tower high enough, you might just be able to patch the sky.

Then, the first brick touches your palm, warm and heavy, and the office walls begin to dissolve into morning light...
