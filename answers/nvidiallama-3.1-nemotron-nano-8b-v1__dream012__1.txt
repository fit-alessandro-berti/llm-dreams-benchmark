In the chaos, the captain squinted at the storm's seething waves, a pulsing, enraged heart beneath the hull, as if it screamed defiance. Their voice soared above the howls, and the crew turned towards them, wide eyes, relieved yet terrified, in that indelible moment of trust.

"Secure the ship, use whatever strength you have," the captain called out. "But we must hold firm," he added. "We've talked it out; with teamwork, we can survive this."

Crew members hesitated, their movements well-oiled from years at sea. For a moment, the captain was the linchpin of calm, rooted in the storm. Sealed skin, blue contacts, they fought back against their smiles breaking. "But we've done this track!," quaved a voice thin with panic. "But now... " They stopped, betrayal bunching in their eyes.

"Together, this is what we do. Our crew's abilities were built for this. We're sailors, not just crew—commented a voice as if the captain wasn't speaking at all. I'm thinking...

Into the chaos, a growl from behind their back, the captain turned to face her. "You're right, and we're one ship, our only ship. My logic now, my krui-kroki-phykri?"

A second voice remembered that feeling, a sense of sea awe within them. The captain gruffly patted their shoulder. "Stop staring at me," he commanded. **"Signal the rallied ship"** his sharp command boot-strapped against the makeshift signals on his back pack.

**(Utilize First Aid Pass) (something brought to light: when a sailor's role is highlighted, perhaps one's blue Nano Seal)**
**(Must include vitality—nail a rope, secure to the capo; then bridge to copex to signal, dangling, like a beacon)**
**(Rodrickson's voice becomes clear: "Our ship's flag!" - his own voice, a cathode in the storm — years of sonar instincts helped, fishing for clarity in chaos — "we're going to save ourselves")**  
**(Command: "Secure me. Then get me the bag!" he called down, gesturing with an unwavering purpose known across the foam. ****
**(His voice reduced to "Hold on," his hands locked around something in his back pouch.)

The captain cursed their wits into the storm, the foes emerging in sending, the  rain tectonic against his bulk. The enduring image was of a ship transformed into steel, its teeth fangs raised by vampiric swimmers. Discoloring the winds, the waves had shifted. Still came the haunting howl—**"The captain holds you, all of you"—in the shipnoises—to close the gap between their disparate selves and the ship's spoiled hull, sealing the wound. The eddy remained, but it was a storm they were now all huddled in, the tidal surge a ghostly rearmark, shifting the wounded rig. And behind the cadence, the captain, bristling through static layers, stood firm, his furrowed gaze casting over his crew, mouth set, in the same, tumultuous hell they shared. They held, not by fear, but by a deep, brotherly instinct. Pond life had made them open water. Seaw had made them brothers. ****
