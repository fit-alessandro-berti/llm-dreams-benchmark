You start to feel a cold sweat of panic prickling your skin as you realize the sheer massiveness of the city around you. How had you even gotten here? The meeting – it was at **9:00 AM sharp**, and it's already **8:45 AM**. The vague address scribbled on the back of a napkin seems useless now, just a meaningless scrawl. The streets are packed with people moving with an urgent purpose you can't fathom. Your feet feel incredibly heavy, making every step a struggle through the dense, unfamiliar atmosphere.

You force yourself to breathe. A plan forms, half-formed and desperate: find a public **map kiosk** or a **tourist information booth**. That's usually where people go when they're lost. You push past a dense knot of commuters, the noise overwhelming – subway announcements, vendor cries, car horns blaring a discordant symphony. 

The first kiosk you find is inactive, its screen blank and dusty. The attendant is a homeless person sleeping on the concrete floor, completely oblivious. Panic surges again, stronger this time. You can't miss this meeting; it means something important, something critical. Your gaze darts around the bustling street. 

Then, you spot a figure rushing towards the kiosk you just abandoned: a **sharp-suited businessman** in a hurry, glaring at the blank screen with obvious frustration. He's probably late *too*. In a pure act of desperation, you call out, "Excuse me! Excuse me, sir!"

He stops, glances at you like you're a street pest. "What?" he snaps, running a hand through his slicked-back hair, already late.

Struggling to keep your voice steady, you blurt, "I'm lost. I have an important meeting in an hour, but I don't know where it is. I saw you talking to this... this place. Do you know what intersection this kiosk is for? Or... is there a better way to find a meeting location quickly?"

Reason breaks down under the weight of your desperation. He peers at the kiosk screen, irritated by the lack of useful information. "Stupid kiosk," he grumbles, starting to walk away. You chase after him, pleading, "Please, Mr. I can't afford to be late... can you just tell me what street this is?"

He sighs, exasperated but perhaps momentarily softened by the sheer trauma of your voice. "It's Main and 3rd," he spits out, gesturing vaguely towards a colossal, gleaming skyscraper a few blocks down. "That conference centre you see? That's where the *big* meetings happen. Last time I was here... I had to wait an hour just to get in!" He sneers, implying your meeting is likely trying to do something impossible or illegal within the hour. He hustles away, leaving you more bewildered and late than ever.

Now, on Main Street, staring up at the imposing structure, the towers seem to loom larger with every passing second. Your watch reads **8:50 AM**. You see people lining up at the entrance, faces set in stone determination or worried confusion like yours. You feel the familiar tug of dream logic fighting to surface – maybe you soar above the city? Order a horse-drawn carriage? Just... wake up? But the meeting, the importance of it, pins you to the spot. This is how your dream most commonly plays out... ending not with resolution, but with you frozen, sweating, just one minute away from the deadline, lost in a sea of insurmountable urban chaos.

**Where does the dream go next?** Do you try to claim you have credentials? Do you glimpse movement inside? Do a forgotten detail on your scribbled address snap into place? Does your pursuer race back, seeing you missed the bus/elevator/external shuttle? Does the city literally dissolve beneath you, revealing a familiar bedroom? Let the dream continue...
