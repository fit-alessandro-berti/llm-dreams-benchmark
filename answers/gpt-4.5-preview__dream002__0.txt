the sky darkens rapidly, heavy clouds swirling ominously overhead. A powerful gust rushes through the forest, shaking the trees violently and scattering leaves around you. You start running faster, searching for shelter, as thunder rumbles menacingly in the distance.

Ahead you notice a soft glow emanating from between the trees, guiding you deeper into the woods. Curious, you follow the gentle, calming light and discover it leads to an ancient stone cottage you've never seen before. You approach cautiously, yet its warmth and safety seem to beckon you inside. Rain begins pouring heavily, soaking you thoroughly. Without hesitation, you step through the doorway into the cottage. Inside, the storm's fury fades into tranquil silence, replaced by a comforting glow from a fire crackling gently in the hearth.

Looking around, you see familiar items placed lovingly upon shelves—memories of people you've known, places you've visited, and dreams you've held dearly. Each item you touch fills your heart with calming reassurance, gently washing away all fears of the storm outside. Taking a seat by the fireplace, you notice a book resting on an old wooden table next to you. Curious, you open it to discover that the pages are blank, waiting patiently for your story.

What would you write next?
