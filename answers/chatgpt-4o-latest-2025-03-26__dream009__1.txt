You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **blend in quickly if you're going to survive.**

The air feels different—thicker with woodsmoke and the scent of earth. Around you, people mill about in tunics and cloaks, bartering goods at a dusty market square. Horse-drawn carts bump over uneven cobblestones. There's no hum of engines, no glowing screens—just the warm, chaotic murmur of a village waking into life.

You glance down. You’re wearing clothes you don’t recognize: rough-hewn linen, bound with leather cords. A small leather pouch hangs at your waist. Inside, you find three strange coins, a folded piece of parchment with indecipherable writing, and a small, carved wooden token in the shape of a crescent.

A bell rings in the distance, and the crowd tenses. A man in ornate armor rides into the square on a jet-black horse, his banner fluttering in the wind—a silver griffin on a field of crimson. Townspeople bow their heads. You're the only one standing tall—out of place. His icy gaze sweeps the crowd and lands on you.

"You there," he says, pointing.

Panic prickles at the back of your neck. Should you run? Speak? Pretend? You don't know the customs. But something about the wooden token in your pouch pulses with warmth—like it’s calling you.

**You slip your hand into your pocket and grip the token. A faint whisper enters your mind: _Find the Seer beneath the mountain. She holds the key to your return._**

You take a deep breath. Whatever this dream is—whatever this world is—you’re in it now.

What do you do next?
