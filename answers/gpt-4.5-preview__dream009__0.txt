adapt quickly. You step outside, fog rolling between cobbled streets, lanterns flickering, and carriages rumbling by. The air feels different—clean but filled with the scent of earth, horses, and woodsmoke. People hurry about their day, unfamiliar faces dressed plainly, speaking a language that sounds familiar yet old-fashioned.

As you wander, curiosity mixing with confusion, you realize you need to find answers. You approach a street vendor selling fresh bread, and cautiously ask “What year is this?” The vendor's puzzled glance quickly dissolves into gentle laughter, responding that it's the year 1772.

Struck by disbelief, you know that you must blend in, learn quickly, and find work—or even just a safe place to sleep. You start exploring options, eyeing tradespeople at their craft: blacksmiths hammering hot iron, carpenters shaping wood, bakers kneading dough. But before you can make your choice, you're drawn toward the sound of running feet and murmurs of excitement. Crowds gather anxiously around a town square noticeboard, a large parchment hastily pinned there:  

"Volunteers urgently required for an expedition into unknown lands. Rewards great, risks greater."

Your pulse quickens. This could be your chance—to explore, discover answers about this mysterious era, perhaps even find a way home. Drawn by both necessity and curiosity, you step forward and mark your name, joining the crew setting out toward adventure—in an unknown age, in a dream you can only barely comprehend.
