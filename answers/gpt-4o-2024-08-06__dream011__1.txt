all written in a language you've never seen before. The symbols are swirling on the page, forming and reforming into shapes that look both familiar and alien. Panic begins to creep in, but when you glance around the room, you realize that everyone else is calmly writing their answers, seemingly untroubled by the linguistic chaos.

Suddenly, you hear a soft rustling sound beside you. Turning slightly, you notice a small, luminous creature sitting on your desk. It looks like a cross between a firefly and a miniature dragon, its delicate wings shimmering with colors that echo the confusing symbols on the exam paper. It tilts its head, looking at you with eyes full of understanding and mirth.

Without a word, the creature taps one of its claws on the exam paper. Instantly, the chaotic symbols begin to resolve into clear, comprehensible text. The questions now read like gentle puzzles, each one drawing on not just the material from the course, but on insights you've gathered throughout your entire life.

Feeling a wave of relief, you pick up your pen and begin to write. With each answer, the paper seems to lighten, and you sense a growing connection between your thoughts and the shifting symbols. The final question stands out, glowing softly: "Who are you when stripped of fear?"

As you ponder this, the room around you fades slightly, becoming less distinct. You focus inwardly, letting the question guide you through layers of self-perception and identity. An indescribable clarity emerges, as if your entire being is crafted from a single, coherent narrative.

With newfound confidence, you write your answer. The luminous creature flutters its wings in approval and the room slowly begins to dissolve. The exam, the desk, the other students—all evaporate into a soft haze, leaving you suspended in the peaceful awareness of your true self.

And in that moment of realization, you wake up, your heart filled with a quiet certainty that transcends the dream.
