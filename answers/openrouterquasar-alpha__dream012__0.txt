grip the helm tightly, feeling the salt spray lash your face as thunder cracks overhead. Lightning illuminates the towering waves, and for a moment, you catch the fearful eyes of your crew. Drawing a deep breath, you shout steady, commanding words over the roar of the tempest:  

“Hold fast! Trust your posts. We’ve weathered storms before, and we’ll survive this one.”  

Your voice cuts through their panic like a beacon, and the sailors redouble their efforts, fighting to keep the sails secured and the ship on course. You focus all your will on steering through the chaos, instinct guiding your hands as the vessel plunges and twists. Somehow, amidst this fury, there’s a moment of clarity—a calm certainty that you and your crew have the strength to endure.  

Suddenly, the clouds begin to thin, and the sea’s fury slowly relents. Dawn breaks on the horizon, bathing the battered ship in golden light. Your crew erupts in relieved cheers, and you smile quietly, knowing you’ve once again guided them safely through the storm.
