The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **step back, take a deep breath, and say, "I need to understand your point of view better. Can you explain it to me again, but this time, tell me why it *feels* so important, not just why it *is* important?"**

The dream shifts, the harsh lines of the room softening. Your friend's angry expression flickers, replaced by surprise, then a slow, weary openness. As they begin to speak, their voice is no longer a weapon, but a story. And you realize you aren't just listening to an argument anymore—you're listening to a fear, a hope, a memory you never knew they carried. The dream isn't about who wins, but about the bridge being built, word by word, in the space between you.
