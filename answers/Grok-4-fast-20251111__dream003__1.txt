You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and symbols etched into its surface—swirling vines that seem to writhe like living shadows, ancient runes that pulse faintly with an inner glow, as if whispering secrets in a language forgotten by the waking world. Your fingers trace the edges, and a shiver runs through you, not from cold, but from the sudden certainty that the box is breathing, its wooden sides rising and falling in sync with your own heartbeat.

Curiosity overrides caution. You press your palm flat against the largest symbol—a spiraling eye that stares back with unnerving familiarity—and the box hums to life. A soft click echoes from within, not from a lock yielding, but from the box unfolding like origami crafted by forgotten gods. Panels shift and slide, revealing not a keyhole, but a mirror inside: your reflection, but altered. This version of you wears a cloak woven from starlight, eyes like fractured emeralds, and in your hands, it holds a key made of liquid silver, dripping onto the box's floor where it pools into shapes of half-remembered faces—your childhood dog, a lost love, the shadow of a decision you never made.

The dream-self in the mirror smiles, a grin too wide, too knowing. "The key isn't to open it," it says, voice echoing like wind through hollow bones. "It's to become it." Before you can protest, the silver key leaps from its grasp, burrowing into your chest like a seed taking root. Warmth spreads, not painful, but transformative—your skin prickles as the patterns from the box migrate onto you, vines curling up your arms, runes blooming across your knuckles. You feel heavier, lighter, infinite. The box collapses inward, folding into your pocket as if it were always meant to be there, a pocket-sized universe humming against your thigh.

Now the world tilts. The room around you—the bland hotel in a city you'll never remember—melts into a labyrinth of floating islands, each one a fragment of "what if." One island is a library where books rewrite themselves as you read, pages turning to reveal alternate lives: you as a pirate charting nebulae, you as a composer whose symphonies summon storms. Another is a garden of glass flowers that chime prophecies when brushed, warning of a dawn that tastes like regret.

You leap from island to island, the key in your chest pulsing like a second heart, guiding you toward a horizon where the sun is a colossal, lazy cat batting at the edges of night. But as you near it, doubt creeps in—the old, waking kind. What if this is too much? What if you can't carry the weight of all these possibilities? The islands begin to fray, threads of reality pulling loose, and you tumble, not falling, but unraveling, the box's patterns dissolving into your skin like ink in water.

You wake with a start, sheets tangled around you like vines, the taste of silver on your tongue. The room is ordinary again, the hotel clock ticking 3:17 AM. But in your pocket—wait, you're in bed, no pockets—something shifts. You reach under the pillow and pull out a small, etched wooden shard, warm to the touch. The eye symbol winks at you once before fading. And just like that, you know: the dream isn't over. It's waiting for you to dream it again.
