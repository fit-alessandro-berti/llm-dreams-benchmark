You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the sky darkens to an unnatural black, swirling with veins of electric blue lightning. Thunder roars like a beast awakening beneath the earth, shaking leaves from the trees in a frantic cascade.

You quicken your pace, branches whipping at your face, but the path twists ahead into a misty void. Rain begins—not water, but shimmering droplets of silver that sting like needles and whisper secrets in forgotten tongues as they touch your skin. "Turn back," they murmur. "The heart awaits."

Ahead, the trees part to reveal a colossal oak, its trunk split open like a wound, pulsing with an inner glow. From within steps a figure: a woman with eyes like storm clouds and hair flowing like wind-torn rivers. She extends a hand, her voice echoing in your mind: "You've dreamed me into being. Will you enter the storm, or wake?"

The wind howls louder, pulling you forward. What do you do?
