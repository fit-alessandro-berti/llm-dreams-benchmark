# The Captain's Dream

You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you stand resolute at the helm, your hands gripping the wooden wheel so tightly your knuckles turn white. The sky has darkened to an impossible shade of violet-black, with lightning that cracks open the heavens in brilliant veins of silver.

\Captain!\ the howling wind, rain plastering his hair to his forehead. \earing! We can't hold course much longer!\ claws at your chest, you find yourself oddly calm. You've sailed these waters before, perhaps in another life, another dream. You know, somehow, that beneath these waves lurks something ancient that has called the storm.

\ the anchor,\ carrying unnaturally across the deck. The crew looks bewildered, but your certainty doesn't waver.

\ be sitting ducks in this maelstrom!\atswain.

\ me,\ your eyes begin to glow with the same electric blue as the distant lightning.

As the anchor plunges into the depths, the ship stops fighting the waves and instead begins to rotate slowly. The storm continues to rage, but now it circles around you, your vessel becoming the impossibly calm eye of the hurricane.

The sea beneath you begins to glow, illuminating faces of those you've lost, those you've loved, those you've yet to meet—all watching from beneath the surface of the water.

You realize this ship isn't just carrying cargo and crew. It's carrying memories, hopes, fears—all the fragments of your consciousness navigating the tumultuous seas of your mind.

\'re not going through the storm,\-eyed crew. \ it.\ begins to descend, not sinking but diving purposefully into the glowing depths, the storm above becoming distant thunder as you captain your vessel into the unconscious deep, toward whatever revelation awaits.
