As you weave through the murmuring crowd, the faces blur into mosaics of laughter and half-heard conversations. The first group you approach is clustered around a piano, their voices harmonizing in a song you don’t recognize. When you ask if they’ve seen your friend, they turn in unison, their smiles a little too wide, and begin humming a tune that vibrates in your teeth. You back away, disoriented.  

The next cluster stands motionless in a circle, heads tilted upward. You follow their gaze to a chandelier dripping with liquid light, droplets hitting the floor but leaving no trace. One woman whispers, *“It’s better if you don’t look too closely,”* and you feel the words slither down your spine.  

Down a hallway lined with mirrors, another group debates in riddles. *“What’s always borrowed but never returned?”* a man asks, his reflection flickering. Before you can answer, the wall behind him dissolves into a garden where shadow-figures waltz under a paper moon. Among them, you spot a familiar laugh—*their* laugh—but when you sprint toward it, the garden twists into a maze of hedges with thorns that snag your sleeves.  

You emerge into a room where everyone wears masks of your friend’s face. Their plastic eyes follow you, mouths creaking open in unison: *“You’re late.”* Your heartbeat thrums in your throat as you rip off a mask, only to find nothing beneath it.  

Then, suddenly, there they are—leaning against a balcony railing, bathed in starlight. Relief floods you until they turn, and their features melt like wet paint. *“I couldn’t wait forever,”* they say, voice echoing from all directions. The floor beneath you cracks, and you’re falling—  

—until you jolt awake, the taste of their name still dissolving on your tongue.
