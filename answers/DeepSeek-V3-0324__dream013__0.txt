feel the air grow colder, and the walls seem to pulse with an eerie, faint glow. The next puzzle before you is unlike the others—it’s a massive, shifting labyrinth of symbols and numbers, projected onto the floor like a hologram.  

As you step closer, the symbols rearrange themselves into a cryptic equation:  

$$  
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}  
$$  

A whisper echoes through the maze: *"Solve the riddle of the fields, and the path shall reveal itself."*  

You recognize this as one of Maxwell's equations—Faraday's Law of Induction—but the maze demands more than just recognition. It wants you to *apply* it. A panel slides open beside you, revealing a control interface with dials labeled **Electric Field (E)**, **Magnetic Field (B)**, and **Time (t)**.  

What do you do?  

(Do you adjust the fields experimentally? Try to derive a solution mathematically? Or is there another way to proceed?)
