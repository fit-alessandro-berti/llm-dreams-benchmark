As you approach, the canvas isn't just blank; it seems to absorb the light around it, a perfect void in a world of chaotic hues. Without a brush in hand, you realize you don't need one.

You reach out, your fingertips trailing through the air. Where your fingers move, trails of iridescent mist linger. You touch the canvas, and it ripples like water. With a surge of intention, you pull down, and the canvas tears open—not with a rip, but with the sound of a cello string being plucked.

Through the tear, you see not the wooden frame behind it, but a different reality entirely: a calm, quiet forest where the leaves are made of glass and the wind sounds like whispers. You step through the tear, and the world of shifting shapes dissolves behind you, replaced by the stillness of the glass forest. You are the painter, and you have painted a door to wake up.
