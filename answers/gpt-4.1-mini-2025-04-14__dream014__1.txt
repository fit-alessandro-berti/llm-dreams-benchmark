follow them through the winding streets, their warmth and kindness wrapping around me like a comforting blanket. As we walk, the noise of the city softens until it feels like a gentle hum in the background. Together, we reach a quiet park, filled with blossoming trees and a shimmering pond. Sitting by the water, I realize that even in the busiest places, connection and kindness can create a sanctuary. The strangers smile, and in their eyes, I see a reflection of hope and belonging.
