…feel a gentle tug at your sleeve. You look up to see three strangers—each wearing a different-colored scarf that seems to glow faintly in the city’s neon haze. One offers you a map drawn in shimmering ink, another hands you a small brass key, and the third simply smiles, nodding toward a narrow alley bathed in warm golden light.

Curiosity outweighs your caution. You follow them through twisting streets where the honks and shouts of traffic soften into a distant murmur. Above you, billboards flicker messages of encouragement—“You belong here,” “Trust the journey”—and with each reassuring glance from your guides, your heart pounds a little less urgently. The alley opens onto a hidden courtyard where vines climb crumbling stone walls, petals drift on a gentle breeze, and a single stone bench invites you to sit.

One stranger taps the map, pointing to a location marked “Here you begin.” The brass key fits into a tiny door in the courtyard wall, and when you turn it, the door swings open onto a rooftop garden overlooking the city. Below, the bustle still roils, but up here, lanterns swing in the evening breeze, and laughter drifts from lantern-lit tables. Your new friends usher you toward an empty seat, offering you a cup of warm tea that tastes of honey and starlight.

Seated among these strangers—who are not so strange now—you realize you’re no longer lost. In their kindness you’ve found direction, in their smiles a sense of home. And as the city lights below begin to twinkle in response to the lanterns above, you close your eyes and breathe deeply, knowing that when you wake, you’ll carry this sense of belonging with you, wherever you go.
