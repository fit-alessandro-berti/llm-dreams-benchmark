You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, where towering glass spires shimmer against a twilight sky and streets are paved with shifting patterns of light and shadow. You realize you have an important meeting in an hour, but no idea where it is—only a faint whisper in your mind: a name, *Elias Voss*, and a address that flickers just out of focus on a cracked smartphone screen.

You start to walk, gripping the edge of a rusted lamppost as neon signs project fragmented memories—broken icons of cafes, clock towers, a subway station—each one unreliable. Every turn bends oddly; streets loop back on themselves, faintly echoing sounds of distant chatter and rhythmic footsteps behind you.

As the 60 minutes tick by, your breath quickens. You pause at a alley where a singular, flickering marquee glows: *Elias Voss – Meeting Now*. But the words shimmer, unstable.

You remember a voice—calm, urgent—calling your name. Trying to steady yourself, you adjust your coat and follow the faint hum of signal networks, stepping toward a glass-domed transit hub. There, behind a glowing console, a familiar face approaches: Elias. His eyes lock onto yours, and you realize—the meeting isn’t just a place. It’s a heartbeat in this city, a moment waiting to be seized.

You reach out, time slipping—strangely, not unlike a dream—remembering everything is possible, everything depends on the next step.
