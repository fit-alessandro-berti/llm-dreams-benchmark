You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panic, your heart racing as you glance at the glowing digital clock on a nearby billboard—*3:58 PM*. The city around you feels alive, pulsing with a strange rhythm, its buildings twisting into impossible angles, their facades shimmering with shifting colors that seem to whisper secrets only you can hear. Street signs are written in languages you don’t recognize, and the streets themselves seem to curve in on themselves, leading you in circles.  

You sprint down a narrow alley, dodging floating platforms that hover above the ground like discarded stepping stones. A neon sign flickers above you, reading *“The Clocktower of Lost Time”*—but when you look up, there’s no tower, only a massive, cracked sundial embedded in the sky, its hands spinning backward. A voice, both familiar and foreign, calls your name from the shadows. You turn to see a figure in a tattered cloak, their face obscured by a mask shaped like a clock.  

“Follow me,” they say, their voice echoing as if from a thousand places at once. “The meeting is… *not* a place. It’s a moment.”  

You hesitate, but the clock’s hands suddenly snap forward, and the air shimmers. The figure vanishes, leaving you with a single clue etched into your palm: *“Where time forgets, you will find it.”*  

You run, now through a labyrinth of mirrored corridors that reflect not your face, but fragments of memories you can’t place. The clock’s ticking grows louder, each second a drumbeat counting down. You stumble into a square dominated by a giant hourglass, its sands flowing upward. At its base, a door marked *“12:00”* glows faintly.  

As you approach, the clock’s hands freeze. The city holds its breath. You open the door—and find yourself in a room filled with clocks, each one ticking backward. In the center stands a figure—the same one from the alley, now without a mask. They smile.  

“Your meeting is *here*,” they say. “But only if you can answer one question: *What is time, if not a lie?*”  

The clock’s hands begin to spin again. The city stirs. You have *one minute* to decide.  

Will you wake up—or will this be the meeting you’ve been waiting for all along?
