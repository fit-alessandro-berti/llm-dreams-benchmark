the wind picks up, rustling the leaves with an eerie whisper. The once warm sunlight vanishes behind dark, swirling clouds, and the scent of rain fills the air. Thunder rumbles in the distance, sending a vibration through the ground beneath your feet. 

As you take a cautious step forward, a flash of lightning illuminates the forest, revealing something unexpected—a narrow, winding path that wasn’t there before. The trees seem to lean toward it, as if beckoning you forward. A strange glow pulses at the end of the path, shifting in color from deep blue to shimmering gold. 

Curiosity pulls you toward the glowing light. With each step, the air hums with energy, and the storm above seems to still, as if holding its breath. Suddenly, the trees open into a clearing where an enormous, ancient tree stands in the center. Its bark is silver, its branches reach high into the sky, and its roots seem to pulse with life. At the base of the tree, a door appears, etched with symbols that seem oddly familiar—as if you’ve seen them in a forgotten memory or an old dream. 

A voice, soft but commanding, whispers through the air: *"The storm is only a test. Will you step forward and remember?"* 

You feel the weight of the moment. The door awaits. The storm crackles above. What will you do?
