Here’s a dream continuation — surreal, shifting, and steeped in dream logic:

---

You push through the crowd, a living river of nameless faces. The air hums with overlapping conversations and distant laughter, but the sound mutes as if underwater. Your friend’s smile flickers in your memory, a warm anchor. *Where are they?*  

Ahead, you stumble into a circle of people wearing identical silver masks. They turn in unison, their movements unnervingly synchronized. One steps forward, holding out a clock with no hands. "Time for the unveiling," they whisper, their voice layered like static. You back away, heart pounding, and the circle dissolves like smoke — revealing an empty hallway lined with doors *just* shorter than you. Each door has a peephole glowing faintly blue.  

You peer through the first. Inside, the room is mirror-lined, reflecting infinite copies of yourself, all turning to tilt their heads at you. The air feels thick, heavy. You move to the next door: through this peephole, you see your friend laughing with someone you’ve never met — a figure cloaked in shadows with hands like roots. Relief twists into unease. You reach for the knob, but the door dissolves into sand, trickling through your fingers.  

Suddenly, the hallway vanishes. You’re standing in a vast garden under a starless sky. Every flower is made of paper, and every leaf whispers a single word: *"Lost."* A statue in the center captivates you — it’s made of shattered glass, shaped like a person. As you draw near, the glass shimmers. It’s *your friend*. They turn, pieces of their face crumbling like sugar, and murmur, *"You were looking everywhere but where the root grows."*  

You wake to sunlight streaming through your window, the echo of *root* still tingling on your tongue — and a single paper petal on your pillow.

### Dream Logic Notes:
- **Symbolic Shifts**: Rooms become hallways, gardens emerge indoors. Dreams warp spaces to reflect emotional states (anxiety → confusion → revelation).  
- **Uncanny Triggers**: Synchronized masks, faceless crowds, and distorted reflections evoke subconscious unease about social performance.  
- **The Root Metaphor**: Where the root grows → the subconscious, overlooked truths, or the need to look inward instead of outward for connection.  
- **Ambiguous Resolution**: The friend appears, then crumbles — dreams rarely provide answers, only fragments that linger.
