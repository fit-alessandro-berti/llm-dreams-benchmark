# The Way Back

You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you feel a surge of relief so profound it almost feels like floating.

They are ordinary in the most extraordinary way—a woman with silver rings on every finger, a teenager with a worn library book tucked under his arm, an older man carrying groceries that seem to hum with warmth. They don't ask questions. They simply fall into step beside you, as if they've been waiting for you all along.

The city shifts around you. The concrete softens. The noise becomes a kind of music. The strangers speak in turns, telling you about their lives—the silver-ringed woman lost her daughter here twenty years ago and now spends her Thursdays looking for others who've wandered astray. The teenager nods, explaining that he got lost on his first day of high school and found his way only by helping someone else find theirs. The older man smiles and says simply, "We all get lost. The kindness is in the finding together."

They lead you through streets that wind like rivers, past neon signs that spell out words in languages you've forgotten you knew. You pass a park where the trees are made of light, a café where the coffee smells like your grandmother's kitchen, a bookstore where the books whisper their stories to anyone who pauses to listen.

At some point, you realize you're no longer afraid. The strangers have formed a kind of constellation around you, each one a star in your personal sky, and together you walk through the sleeping heart of the city as it dreams around you.

They stop at a corner where three streets meet. "This is where we leave you," the woman says, though her voice sounds like a song. "Not because you're alone, but because you never were."

You look down and see that your feet have become roots, firmly planted in the sidewalk. You are not lost anymore. You are home—right here, in this moment, in this body, held by the memory of strangers who chose kindness in a city that could have let you disappear.

When you wake, you carry them with you: the silver rings, the library book, the grocery bags humming with warmth. And you wonder, as the morning light spills across your face, how many others are wandering tonight, hoping someone will notice, hoping someone will stop and say, *I've got you. You're not alone.*

You decide, right then, that you will be that stranger. You will be that way back.
