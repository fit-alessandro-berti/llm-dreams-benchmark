…rely on things you haven’t had to think about in years: the muscle memory from camping trips, the snippets of history class that float to the surface like old songs, the instinct to keep your mouth shut until you figure out what’s safe to say.

The air smells of wood smoke and damp earth. The houses are half–timber and thatch, the roads are slick mud stamped flat by wagon wheels. Women in roughspun dresses carry baskets of turnips; men in leather aprons hammer at glowing iron. When you fumble in your pocket for your phone, your fingers close on nothing but lint. No reception, no maps, no messages—only the steady ache of realizing your lifeline is gone.

A few children stop their play to stare at you. Your clothes, your hair, the way you stand—it all makes you a curiosity. You pull your hoodie tighter around yourself, tucking your wrists so your watch doesn’t catch the light. Somewhere in the back of your mind, you remember that being too strange could get you branded witch, foreigner, threat. You force your shoulders down, slow your breathing. Blend in.

Your stomach knots. You haven’t eaten. You remember that clean water is life. You follow the sound of a stream, past the edge of the settlement, through a copse of trees that look younger than any park trees you know. Kneeling at the bank, you see your own reflection, rippled and blurred, eyes too wide. A handful of river water tastes like soil and sky.

Footsteps crack twigs behind you. You spin, heart pounding. A boy—fifteen maybe—stands there with a brace of rabbits slung over his shoulder. He squints at you, then jerks his chin toward the village. “You lost?”

His words are rough and musical, an old dialect your ear almost understands. It makes you dizzy to hear it. You nod and manage, “Yes,” because “yes” has been “yes” for centuries.

He shrugs and motions. You follow. In his wake, you move through a rhythm that is as old as humanity: the barter of bread for eggs, the gossip at the well, the smell of yeast and ash. Someone presses a warm heel of bread into your hand without asking who you are. Someone else laughs when you try to lift a bucket too heavy for you.

Under the low lintel of a house, an old woman grabs your wrist. Her grip is surprisingly strong. For a moment you think you’ve been found out, that she can smell the future on your skin. She peers into your face, into your eyes, and then she smiles, a toothless, knowing crescent. “Been waiting a long time for you,” she says, and you swear the words are clear as a radio broadcast.

You blink. The room swims. In the corners, herbs hang drying. The rafters are draped with bunches of lavender, sage, something like rosemary. She thrusts a bundle into your hands. “If you want to get back where you belong, take this when the moon is full. Go to the big oak at the edge of the fields. Sit and be still. Don’t speak. Don’t answer if called.”

You want to ask a hundred questions—Who are you? How did you know I’m not from here? Is this even real?—but in that way dreams sometimes have, your mouth won’t form the words. You nod again. Your palms sweat around the herbs.

Days pass in a blur of work and waiting. You learn to carry water without spilling, to sleep on straw, to not gag at the smell of the tanner’s yard. At night, the stars look raw and brilliant, without the halo of city light. You find yourself missing small things: the hum of your refrigerator, the glow of your alarm clock, the way your computer screen would wake you up with a burst of emails. And you find yourself strangely soothed by the slowness, by hands that know exactly how to knead dough without a timer.

On the night of the full moon, you creep to the oak. You sit cross‑legged, clutching the bundle so hard the stems bruise. Insects chirp, a wolf howls far off. The moon climbs, silvering the fields. You try to be still. You try not to think of anything. But dreams don’t obey rules.

A voice calls your name. It’s distant at first, like someone in the next room calling you for dinner. You press your lips together. The voice calls again, closer this time, softer. It sounds like your mother. It sounds like yourself. It sounds like your phone alarm.

You clench your teeth and squeeze your eyes shut. You don’t answer. The voice becomes insistent, becomes a beeping, becomes the shrill, steady ring of the alarm on your nightstand.

You open your eyes to a rectangle of morning sun on your bedroom wall. Your duvet is twisted around your legs. Your phone is buzzing inches from your head, screen lit with a dozen notifications. Somewhere outside, a car horn honks.

For a long moment you lie there, heart hammering, hands curled as if still holding herbs. The smell of wood smoke and sage seems to linger. You reach for your phone out of habit, thumb already swiping. But before you look at the screen, you set it back down. You close your eyes again and listen—to the hum of the refrigerator, to the muffled footsteps in the hallway, to the city waking up all around you—and to the phantom memory of a world without any of it.

You swing your feet to the floor and, without thinking, you whisper to the empty room, “Thank you.”
