# The Storm

You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you grip the helm with white-knuckled hands, feeling the wheel fight you like a living thing.

The waves are wrong. You realize this slowly, the way you realize things in dreams — they're not cresting and falling. They're *breathing*. The ocean swells and contracts like the ribcage of something impossibly vast beneath you.

"Captain! Orders!" your first mate shouts, rain streaming down her face. But when you look at her, her eyes are lanterns — warm, amber, flickering.

You open your mouth to command *hard to starboard*, but what comes out instead is: **"Cut the sails. All of them."**

The crew stares. This is madness. Without sails, you're at the mercy of whatever lives below.

But they trust you. The canvas falls like shed skin.

And then — silence. The storm doesn't stop, but it goes *quiet*, as if someone pressed a hand over the world's mouth. The ship settles into the rhythm of the breathing sea, rising and falling gently now, cradled.

You look down into the water and see stars. Not reflections — the ocean has become the sky, and you are sailing through a constellation you've never named.

Your first mate stands beside you. "Where are we going, Captain?"

You realize you know. You've always known. There's a harbor at the edge of the dark where a light has been burning for you since before you were born.

"Home," you say.

The ship sails downward into the stars, and the crew doesn't scream. They *sing*.

And somewhere far away, your sleeping body turns over, smiling at something it won't remember.
