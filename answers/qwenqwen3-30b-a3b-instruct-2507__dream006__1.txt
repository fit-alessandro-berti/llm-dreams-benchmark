...begin to speak, but the words that come out are in a language I’ve never heard before. They sound ancient, melodic, and layered – like wind through a canyon or the hum of distant stars. The audience listens in rapt silence, not with confusion, but with recognition. Their eyes shimmer with understanding, as if they’ve been waiting for this exact moment, this exact sound.

Then, the microphone in my hand starts to glow. Soft, iridescent light pulses from its core, and I feel a strange warmth spread through my fingertips. As I continue speaking, the words begin to *manifest*. Each sentence I utter floats into the air as shimmering, translucent glyphs, swirling like fireflies made of light. They rise above the crowd, weaving together into a living tapestry – a vast, intricate constellation of meaning, history, and emotion.

I realize with wonder: the audience isn’t just listening; they’re *remembering*. Faces flicker with memories not their own – a childhood in a city that never existed, the taste of a fruit from a planet I’ve never seen, the profound sorrow of a war that happened a thousand years ago in a time I’ve never lived. Laughter ripples through the crowd, not at me, but *with* me, as if sharing a secret held across eons.

Then, a single note, pure and crystalline, breaks through the chorus of light. It comes from *my* voice, but it’s the voice of someone else – a grandmother I never knew, a poet from a forgotten age. The light intensifies, the tapestry surges, and in that moment, I understand: *I am not giving a speech. I am remembering.* This isn't rehearsal. It’s revelation. The audience isn't waiting to hear *me*. They’re waiting for *us*.

The final word hangs in the air – not a sound, but a feeling: profound peace, like the earth settling after a storm. The light fades. The audience remains, quiet, radiant, transformed. And I stand on the stage, no longer just the speaker, but a vessel. The silence echoes, not with emptiness, but with the weight of a truth finally spoken.

*(The dream shifts. The stage dissolves. I’m standing on a high cliff, overlooking a sea of stars. A familiar voice – my own, yet distant – whispers: "The next truth is waiting.")*
