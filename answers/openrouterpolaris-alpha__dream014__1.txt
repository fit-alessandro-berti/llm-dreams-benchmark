…follow them.

They don’t rush you. They move at your pace, forming a loose circle that parts the crowd just enough for you to breathe. One of them, a woman with mismatched earrings, asks where you’re trying to go.

You open your mouth to answer and realize you don’t know. Not the name, not the street—only a feeling: open sky, something green, quiet.

“That’s enough,” says the man walking on your left. His voice is gentle, like he’s answering a question you didn’t ask.

The streets begin to tilt. Neon signs soften into handwritten ones. The traffic noise folds itself into a low, distant hum, like waves heard through a wall. You turn a corner you’re sure wasn’t there before.

Everywhere, small kindness: someone pulling a door, someone holding out a forgotten scarf, someone laughing softly instead of shoving past. The strangers talk as if they’ve known you for years, but only about light things—the best tea in the city, the shortcut through the park, how the clouds today look like sleepy animals.

“Why are you helping me?” you ask.

A girl with ink on her fingers shrugs. “You looked like you needed to remember.”

“Remember what?”

They stop in front of a narrow alley. At the far end: light. Not bright—golden, soaked in late-afternoon warmth. You can smell rain on hot stone, and something floral you associate with childhood.

“That you’re not alone when you’re lost,” the mismatched-earring woman says.

“Even here?” You gesture toward the city, its towers and windows and fast, faceless currents of people.

“Especially here,” the ink-fingered girl replies. “Cities are made of lost people finding each other.”

Their faces blur for a second, then sharpen again, and you notice each of them has your eyes, your mouth, your way of standing. Not identical, but familiar, like siblings you almost remember.

It unsettles you. “Who are you?”

“We’re everyone who ever helped you,” says the man on your left. “And everyone you’ve ever helped. And the selves you left behind.” His smile is sad and proud at once. “We’re the part of you that didn’t give up.”

The city’s roar falls completely silent.

At the end of the alley, the golden light swells into a wide, open place: trees, a bench, sky pouring itself over everything. It isn’t anywhere you can name, but you know you’ve been trying to get back here for a long time.

Your chest loosens.

“Go on,” they say together.

You step forward. The moment your foot touches the light, the fear you’ve been carrying like a stone softens, then dissolves. The city is still there behind you, but now you can see all the gentle paths tucked inside it, all the faces that might look up if you falter.

You turn to thank them.

The group of strangers stands at the mouth of the alley, haloed by city-glow, already half transparent.

“If I get lost again,” you ask, “will you be there?”

They nod.

“We always are,” says the girl with ink on her fingers. “You just forget to look.”

The park breeze smells like rain and possibility. Your phone buzzes in your pocket with a message from a real friend you’ve been meaning to call. A leaf lands in your hand like a small green map.

The city feels less like a maze, more like a book you’re still learning to read.

You sit on the bench, no longer lost, and wake up with the steady, quiet knowledge that next time, you’ll ask for directions sooner—and that someone will answer.
