walk away to cool down. As you step outside, the air feels heavy with tension, but the night sky is clear and full of stars. You take a deep breath, trying to calm your racing thoughts.

Suddenly, you notice a faint glow in the distance—a small, flickering light that seems to pulse in time with your heartbeat. Curious, you follow it, and as you get closer, you realize it’s coming from a tiny, ancient-looking lantern hanging from a low tree branch. The lantern is intricately carved, and when you touch it, the light flares brighter, revealing a hidden path you’ve never seen before.

The path winds through a dense, moonlit forest, and as you walk, the sounds of the argument fade behind you. The trees whisper secrets, and the ground beneath your feet feels alive, as if guiding you forward. At the end of the path, you find a quiet clearing with a still pond reflecting the stars. Sitting beside it is an old, wise figure—perhaps a version of yourself from the future or a guardian of dreams.

They smile knowingly and say, *"The things that divide us are often the same things that bind us. But you already know that, don’t you?"*

You sit beside them, and the weight of the argument lifts. The pond’s surface ripples, showing glimpses of memories—moments of laughter, shared struggles, and the unspoken love between you and your friend. The figure hands you a small, smooth stone and says, *"Take this. When you return, you’ll know what to say."*

You wake up with the stone still in your palm, its warmth lingering. The argument feels distant now, and you realize the heart of the matter wasn’t about being right or wrong—it was about understanding. You reach for your phone, ready to send a message that bridges the gap.

*(Would you like to explore a different direction for the dream?)*
