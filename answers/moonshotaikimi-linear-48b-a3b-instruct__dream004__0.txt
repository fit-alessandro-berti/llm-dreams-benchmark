a spectral paintbrush hovering beside it, humming with a low, melodic chime.  

You reach for the brush, and as your fingers close around its weightless wooden stem, the colors around you ripple—emerald slicing into sapphire, then melting into molten gold. The canvas, still blank, begins to glow faintly, as if it’s remembering every color it has ever seen in other people’s dreams.

You dip the brush into the air itself. Where the bristles touch, sparks of indigo and starlight swirl, and the canvas responds with a soft pulse. You begin to paint—not with logic, but with instinct. A vine of violet unfurls upward, curling into a spiral that opens like a eye blinking in slow motion. A shape—half moth, half hourglass—wings across the surface, trailing freckles of rose quartz that linger like afterimages.

The world around you pulses in rhythm with each stroke. Mountains shift into birds, then back again. A river writes cursive in the sky, and the letters rearrange themselves into your name.

You paint faster now. The brush moves as if it remembers how you danced at your first love’s wedding, how your mother’s laugh sounded when the sun hit the kitchen floor just right, how it felt to fall asleep in a hammock with rain on your face.

The canvas begins to breathe. It inhales the colors you’ve laid down, then exhales them back—now with meaning. A single word appears, glowing softly: *Remember.*

You stop. The brush tips dip, releasing one last droplet of iridescent ink that splashes across the surface, blooming into a circle of light. It doesn’t vanish. It stays, pulsing gently, like a heartbeat.

You realize this isn’t a dream you’re watching from the outside. It’s a dream you’re *inside*. Yours. Someone else’s? No—it’s *shared*, but only by those who look too closely and stay long enough to blur the line between seeing and being seen.

You look down at your hands. They’re not yours. They’re lace and graphite and wind.

The canvas flips itself over. On the back, there’s a new blank space. A smaller one. A mirror, perhaps. You hesitate.

Then you paint.
