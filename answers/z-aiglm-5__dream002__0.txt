the light shifts from dappled golden-green to an ominous bruised purple. The wind picks up—first a whisper through the leaves, then a voice, then a shout. Birds fall silent. The air grows heavy and cool, carrying the metallic scent of approaching rain.

You instinctively start moving faster, though you don't remember choosing a direction. The path beneath your feet has changed too—wider now, the packed dirt giving way to scattered stones that crunch oddly, like they're hollow.

The first drop hits your shoulder. Then another. Then the sky opens.

But here's the strange thing: the rain isn't cold. It's warm, almost body-temperature, and when you look at your hands, catching the droplets, they shimmer with a faint iridescent quality, like diluted pearl. The forest around you has gone silver and strange, every leaf and branch outlined in fine detail, as if the storm has sharpened the world instead of obscuring it.

A flash of lightning illuminates something through the trees—a structure, maybe a building. Stone? Wood? You can't quite tell, but it feels sheltering, feels like it's *waiting* for you.

You run toward it, the warm rain streaming down your face, and just as you reach what appears to be an arched doorway, you realize the storm has stopped making sound. Everything has gone perfectly, impossibly quiet.

The threshold before you is dark, but not threatening. More like a held breath.

You step through.
