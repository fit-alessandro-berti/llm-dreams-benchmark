You decide to pause—really pause. The yelling dies in your throat like words caught in static, and suddenly the room shrinks until it’s just the two of you, floating in the silence. You see the rise and fall of their shoulders—faster than yours, a thin wobble in the left one that you’ve always known means they’re scared they’ve gone too far.  

Instead of another weapon word, you open your mouth and whisper, “I think we’re both trying to protect the same thing.” Red light flickers across their face, some old memory ignited by that sentence. Their arms drop, palms open—not surrender, just empty.  

You step closer, close enough to feel the heat of the space between you. “Tell me what you’re afraid of losing,” you say, and this time you mean it. The dream thins like over-cooked paper; you can almost see the edges peeling away, but you stay, holding the question until it lands.
