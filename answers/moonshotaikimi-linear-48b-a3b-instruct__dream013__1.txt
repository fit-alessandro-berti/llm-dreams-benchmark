Of course—I can continue the dream.

You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, the air grows colder, pressing in like a weight. The walls, once stone, begin to shimmer with a faint, unnatural glow—neither light nor shadow, but something in between. The puzzles shift as you solve them, rearranging themselves in subtle, mocking ways.

You pass through a corridor lined with mirrors. In some, you see yourself older. In others, younger. One shows you asleep, never waking. Each reflection speaks, whispering fragments of things you forgot you knew—and things you wish you’d never learned.

Deeper still, the maze listens. It watches. It *remembers* every choice you’ve made. The path narrows, and the puzzles grow stranger—some ask not for answers, but for bargains. Some solutions come with consequences that bleed beyond the maze.

And then, just ahead, you see it: a door. Not of wood or metal, but of time itself. It pulses like a heartbeat. You reach for the handle, and for a moment, you hesitate. Because beyond that door isn’t just the end of the maze—it’s the possibility of knowing why you entered it at all.

And the dream ends before you open it.
