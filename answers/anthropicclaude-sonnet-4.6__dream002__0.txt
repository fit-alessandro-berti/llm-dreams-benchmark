You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air grows thick and electric, humming against your skin like a plucked string. The leaves above you flip silver-side up, trembling in a wind that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.

The light changes first. That golden afternoon warmth drains away, replaced by a green-grey luminescence that makes everything look underwater. The trees themselves seem to lean inward, as if whispering to one another about what is coming.

Then you notice something strange.

The rain, when it begins to fall, falls *upward.*

Droplets rise from the forest floor, from the moss and the dark soil, lifting in slow spirals toward a sky that has turned the color of a bruise. You hold out your hand and a droplet lands in your palm from below, cool and perfect, and sits there defying everything you know.

The storm sounds like breathing. Deep, measured, ancient breathing.

Between the trees ahead you see a light — warm amber, steady, completely unbothered by the impossibility surrounding it. A small wooden structure, a cabin perhaps, with smoke rising from its chimney in a perfectly straight column despite the chaos swirling around it.

You move toward it and realize the path beneath your feet has changed. It is no longer dirt and root but something that feels like velvet, dark blue, soft as sleep itself.

You reach the door. You raise your hand to knock and —

*the door opens before you touch it.*

Inside, someone is sitting with their back to you, watching a fire, and they say, in a voice you almost recognize...

**"We've been waiting for the storm to bring you. Sit down. There's something you need to remember."**

You step inside, and as the door closes behind you, the upward rain slows, the breathing of the storm softens, and somewhere deep in your chest you feel the beginning of something unlocking — a memory, or perhaps a knowing — that has been folded up and waiting inside you for a very long time.
