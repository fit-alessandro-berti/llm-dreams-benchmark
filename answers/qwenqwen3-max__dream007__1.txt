...and you decide to **stop talking**.

Not out of anger, but because something strange begins to happen. The air around you thickens, shimmering like heat haze off pavement in summer. Your friend’s voice—sharp a moment ago—starts to stretch and warp, syllables dissolving into low hums. You look down and realize your own hands are dissolving too, fingers blurring at the edges like wet ink on paper.

The street you’re standing on—was it always cobblestone?—starts to ripple. The buildings lean inward, their windows blinking like sleepy eyes. Your friend’s face softens, features rearranging subtly: their eyes grow larger, their mouth smaller, until they resemble a childhood drawing of themselves.

You both understand, without words, that the argument was never really about the thing you thought it was. It was about fear. Fear of being forgotten, of drifting apart, of the silence that grows when you stop sharing your dreams.

So you reach out—not with your dissolving hand, but with your mind—and offer a memory instead: the two of you as kids, building a lopsided sandcastle on a beach that doesn’t exist anymore. Your friend’s eyes widen in recognition. The sandcastle appears between you, whole and solid, while the rest of the world melts like candle wax.

The argument evaporates. You sit down cross-legged in the air, now warm and smelling of salt and old books, and begin rebuilding the castle together—this time with walls strong enough to hold every unspoken apology, every withheld "I miss you," every fragile hope you've both carried.

And just before you wake, you hear your friend whisper, *"We were never really fighting. We were just trying to find our way back to this."*

You open your eyes to your quiet room, heart full, and reach for your phone—not to argue, but to send a single message:  
**"Remember that beach? Let’s go back someday."**
