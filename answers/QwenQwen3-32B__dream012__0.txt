...stand at the helm, your hands gripping the wheel as lightning splits the sky, illuminating the churning black waves. The wind howls like a living thing, and the ship lurches, its timbers groaning under the assault. A crewmember shouts—a voice lost instantly in the storm’s roar. Saltwater lashes your face as you scan the chaos.  

Then you see it: the main mast, cracked and splintering, teetering. If it falls, the sails will turn to shreds, and the ship will be at the mercy of the waves. Your mind races. The old navigator’s trick—the *Storm’s Embrace*—but it’s a gamble. You’ll need to steer into the eye of the next wave, ride its crest, and hope the hull holds.  

“Hard to starboard!” you bellow, your voice cutting through the gale. The crew moves, a well-rehearsed dance of fear and trust. The ship responds, tilting precariously as the wave towers above you, a mountain of foam and fury. For a heartbeat, time suspends. Then—*crack*—the mast breaks, but the sails tear free just as you’d hoped, snapping loose and flapping wildly. The ship surges forward, cleared of the debris, and the crew erupts in ragged cheers.  

But the storm isn’t done. A fissure opens in the sea ahead—a vortex, spiraling like a wound in the world. You recognize it from the mariner’s tales: the *Maw of the Deep*, a portal to… something older. Your compass spins, the stars above wink out, and the air grows thick with the scent of iron. The crew stares, paralyzed.  

You think of your father’s words: *“A captain carries the weight of the unknown. But fear is just another tide—it rises, then it falls.”*  

You close your eyes, take a breath, and steer straight into the Maw.  

When you open them, the storm is gone. The sea is calm, moonlit, and the ship drifts toward a shore you don’t recognize—but the air hums with possibility. The crew murmurs of miracles, but you feel it: the ship’s hull now glows faintly, as if the storm’s fury had polished it for a purpose.  

You are no longer just a captain. You are a story the sea will not forget.

*The dream fades, leaving the taste of salt and the echo of a lullaby hummed by the waves.*
