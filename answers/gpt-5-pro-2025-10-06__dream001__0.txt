You start to run, the way you run in a dream—fast in the knees, slow in the air, as if the city has turned to a warm, invisible syrup. The buildings are tall, glass set into stone like teeth, and every reflective surface offers back a different version of you, already late, already arriving, already apologizing.

A clock on a corner reads an hour that isn’t an hour. Beneath it, a map is pinned under a piece of glass. Your fingertip leaves a fog where you trace the route you don’t know. The legend is full of symbols that look like weather and music and small birds. When you try to focus on a street name, the letters soften and bead, then slide into new pronunciations. The blue dot that should mean you swims in little circles, a koi lost in a bowl.

You stop a passerby in a coat the color of argument and ask where the Appointment District is. He answers, “Where it always is,” and points in two directions at once, with hands that don’t belong to him. You thank him for nothing and for everything and move toward the gesture that felt more like warmth.

The air smells like rain about to happen and the steady pastry of a thousand bakeries. Stairs descend. You follow them without deciding to, into a subway that growls with the breath of large animals. The tile work is a mosaic of eyes and calendars. On the wall there’s a poster: MEETING—TODAY—EVERYONE WELCOME. The arrow points down, then decides you’re interesting and swivels toward you. The platform heaves with people who seem to have learned standing from trees.

You board a train whose doors sigh like old friends. Inside, the maps above the windows show a crisscross of colored lines. The station names are declarative: Assurance, Excuse, Almost, Tried, Memory, The Meeting. A recorded voice says, Next stop, Something You Forgot To Bring. You pat your pockets. Phone? Yes, but when you unlock it, the screen is a lake. Your reflection leans in, says, We’ll find it.

At Assurance, no one gets off. At Excuse, everyone gets off, then realizes they’re wrong and floods back on murmuring, Sorry, sorry, sorry, a shoal of apologies. At The Meeting, the doors open, but a sign flashes: Please Wait For The Feeling. You try “prepared,” then “brisk,” then “penitent,” but the platform recedes an inch each time as if it’s shy. The doors close. The recorded voice laughs. Next stop, Third Option.

At Third Option you find stairs that prefer to be a ladder. You climb and the air thins into blue. Somewhere, bells are in practice. You emerge into an alley mouth where a cat with two different eyes is sitting atop a stack of mail. It drops a letter to you without looking, like it knew you were the right address. The envelope is your name in your handwriting, postmarked earlier today, earlier month, earlier life. Inside is a map, sketched in pencil so soft it’s almost breath. When you hold it to the light you see that the streets correspond to the lines on your palm. The city is the hand you forgot you were carrying.

You turn your hand until the lifeline leads you under an arch bristling with pigeon-spikes. The pigeons have learned to roost on the idea of it. A boy sits on the steps, flying a kite that looks exactly like a key. “It’s yours,” he tells you, without any preamble, and presses the spool into your palm. The string tenses and points southeast, as if magnetized by purpose. “Follow what pulls,” he adds, as if reciting a family rule, and grins a missing-tooth grin that understands time better than you do.

You follow the string through a market where oranges are stacked like suns and the grocers carve small windows in their peels for them to look out. A woman sells postcards of places you’ve never been but recognize. The kite tugs when you hesitate, light insistence on your wrist, strange mercy.

The sky lowers in that way cities make it lower: glass and cornices compressing the bowl of afternoon. Your watch stutters and catches, settles on a time that is half-past future. Above you, a sign for a building flickers: APPOINTMENT. The letters crackle in neon and then, as if remembering how to play, rearrange themselves on their wires without losing any grammar: POINT IN ME. You stop and laugh, the kind of laugh that turns into breathing.

Inside, the lobby smells like pepper and paper. The receptionist has a small green plant growing out of the place where the nameplate should be. When you offer your name, she weighs it in her mouth as if it might be fruit, then nods and drops it into a shallow bowl of water. It floats. “Right on time,” she says. You check your watch again out of habit and find it has become a small mirror. Your face looks relieved enough to be someone else’s. The receptionist stamps your wrist with a wet leaf. “Fourth floor, second door on the left, then the hallway that wasn’t there, then the door that opens in.”

The elevator buttons don’t have numbers, only words: Soon, Later, Now, Another Time. You press Now and it lights up with a sound like a camera shutter. The doors open onto a corridor lined with windows, but the view is on the inside: scenes from kitchens you’ve cooked in, shoes you’ve worn down the center, the way your hand looks when you reach for a handle. You walk past them like a museum of your own ordinary, and at the end there is, as promised, a hallway that wasn’t there. It’s full of sunlight as if it had been saving it.

Your hand finds the knob to the door that opens in. It opens in like forgiveness. On the other side, a room that is also a train car, also a park bench at dusk, also the back table at a café where the light is awake but gentle. Across from you sits someone already there. You know their profile the way you know the taste of your own name. Their hair is the future’s version of your hair. Their eyes are the color of lake water under sky. “You made it,” they say, and it’s not a question and still feels like one.

“I didn’t know where it was,” you say, and then, because you’re not sure whether to apologize to someone whose mouth moves like yours, “Thank you for waiting.”

“I start when you arrive,” they answer. Between you is a table with a cup of tea that is exactly your temperature and a clock face without numbers, hands pointing at each other like conversation. They push something across the table: a compass, old-fashioned, the needle trembling like a small nervous animal. The cardinal points have changed: True, Kindly, Honest, Away. The needle swings to Kindly and steadies there.

“I thought the meeting was with—” you start, and trail off, because naming things in this room seems like a way to scare them.

“It is,” they say. “It always is.” They open their briefcase, which is your grandmother’s sewing box. Inside: spools of thread that feel like hours, a pair of scissors too dull to hurt, a handful of buttons the color of lost explanations, a note that says You can be late to an appointment, but not to yourself.

You take out the note and the words rearrange as you read them, the way the neon did, and become You can be late to the appointment or you can be with yourself. You feel something in your sternum unhook, a small clasp you didn’t know was keeping a coat closed.

You talk, but not with your mouth. You feel what you need to say and the room understands. You give over the heavy stone of a certain fear. They slip it into their pocket where it becomes a warm, round thing with a shine, like a river rock. They hand you a thin silver key that unlocks mornings. “Use it often,” they say. “It fits everything that looks ordinary.”

Outside the window, the city reorganizes itself with soft efficiency. The streets align to the bones inside your foot. The crosswalk lights blink not Walk/Don’t Walk but Breathe/Go On. Somewhere a siren becomes a violin. Somewhere a bus kneels for someone else.

You stand. There is no rush in your body anymore, only a forward that doesn’t push. The receptionist stamps the back of your hand as you leave. The ink is a single word: Extend. The kite string is slack now, and when you roll it around the spool it hums a low, satisfied sound, like a cat deciding to sleep.

On the sidewalk the sign flickers again: APPOINTMENT. POINT IN ME. You could swear, for a second, that it also says POINT IN TIME and MEANT TIME and MEET ME, and all of them are true. The boy with the key-shaped kite runs past laughing, and the cat watches from the sun. The sky remembers how to be big.

You check your watch one more time and your reflection looks back, unhurried. There is still an hour. There has always been an hour. You walk into it. The city does not resist you. It flows. You know where you’re going, which is here, which is forward, which is wherever you are when you arrive.
