...you realized the ship wasn’t wood and sail. It was a library. An enormous, circular library, hundreds of tiers tall, built from polished obsidian so deep it seemed to swallow the meager candlelight. Rain lashed against massive, arched windows lined with row after row of ancient volumes. But the rain wasn't *real* rain; it was shimmering motes, like tiny, incandescent diamonds swirling and colliding. 

You gripped the polished curve of a lectern instead of the helm. The swirling "rain" intensified, knocking at the windowpanes and creating a howling symphony of whispers. Your crew was… they were bound. Figures sculpted entirely from solidified ink drifted along their designated posts – the navigators poring over fractal star maps radiating from the ceiling, the cartographers furiously redrawing continents on translucent tablets, the quartermaster meticulously sorting scrolls with spectral efficiency. 

"Captain!" rasped Elias, the Head Archivet, appearing before you. He was composed of fading calligraphy, ink droplets clinging to his inconstant features. “The Narrative is unraveling again! The Great Story… it fragments. We must act before the whole world dissolves into disjointed plot points.”

You felt a dizzying comprehension bloom – this entire ocean wasn’t water, but the boundless expanse of stories ever told. You were the keeper, meant to steer this library-ship, to anchor reality within the flow of narratives. But the storm wasn’t just an outside disruption; it was a reflection of a great story being desperately rewrote itself, fraying reality with each panicked edit.

You searched the tiered shelves around you. Thousands upon thousands of books—bound not with leather and thread, but with solidified emotion and the memories attached to them.  Hope, Love, Fear...they glimmered like jewelled spines in the dim light.

"What caused this unraveling?" you boomed, the vibration rattling the spines around you. 

“A Shadow Story,” Elias whispered, his voice thin.  "An unsanctioned narrative taking root, consuming other stories, stealing their power. It speaks of inevitability, of pointless suffering, and of the ultimate, absolute...silencing." He shuddered, a tiny cloud of iridescent dust falling from him.

Suddenly, the lights flickered violently.  You looked out into the swirling “rain” and saw a form beginning to coalesce-- not of water or mist, but of solidified grayness. It felt... *empty*—devouringly negative. It stretched outward with tendrils made of blank pages. 

“It’s anchored to a singular story,” one of the Ink Navigators wailed, his voice echoing strangely. “A forgotten one. About a princess who never learned to speak…”

Realization surged through you. Sometimes, the smallest stories could wreak the greatest devastation. And just as strong, unfulfilled emotions needed to be addressed for narratives to find peace.

Your crew was immobile, helpless as creations of a text. The solution had to lay within this dream. 
You looked to your lectern, feeling something stir within the polished stone. It began to glow – pulsing now with the accumulated knowledge of the stories around this vessel. From it, an image began to solidify—a young princess, her mouth sealed in a cruel silence, face streaked with despair. 

With determination growing, you understood what needed doing; no matter chaotic waters and shadowy vessels or a princess deprived of speaking. You needed to help her voice reach, let that small narrative rewrite itself.  

Would you focus on helping her find the language of music, finding her expression through creative acts that would transcend the silent narrative, and allowing the princess to grow past despair or perhaps risk to fall into the consuming blankness within the storm ? 



That was the captain’s next decision.
