…the arenas keep shifting like pages being turned by a wind you can feel but never see.

First, there is a room the color of overripe sky, with desks arranged in a circle and strangers in numbered shirts. A bell rings, and the floor gently tilts, sending pens rolling toward the center where a glass bowl waits. “Design a bridge from here to there,” a judge says, pointing nowhere in particular. You draw a line that bends like a question mark and add annotations in the margins: trust, weight, time. When the bell rings again, your paper floats from your hands like a bird relieved of its purpose, and you are already walking across a span you sketched minutes ago. It holds because you wrote “trust” on the beams.

Next, you are in a kitchen impossibly clean, white tiles reflecting light that has no source. The challenge is simple: prepare a meal that reminds you why you wanted this job. Your ingredients are nouns and verbs stored in jars with cork stoppers. You sauté patience in a pan until it turns translucent, sprinkle in a handful of curiosity that pops like mustard seed, and fold in a ribbon of stubborn joy. You plate it on a blank page and serve it to a panel of faceless silhouettes who lean in and inhale. One of them nods, and the nod becomes a door.

Behind the door is a hallway of old portraits, all of them of you, except each one wears a different future. In one, you are tired and quiet; in another, you are radiant and thin with distance. “Pick the one you can live with,” a voice says from the ceiling vents. You step closer to a portrait where your smile is small but honest, and your hands are ink-stained. When you touch the canvas, the paint is still wet. Your fingers leave streaks that look like rivers.

Now you are outside, standing at the edge of a field of clocks buried like stones, only their faces showing. The challenge is to cross without stopping time. The second hands are dragonflies; the minute hands are metronomes; the hours are the slow inhale of the earth. You begin to walk, your breath matching the ticks, your feet finding places between moments. Halfway, your shadow falls across a clock and the seconds wobble like a soap bubble. “Keep moving,” someone whispers, and you do, because you must, because stopping here would anchor you to a past you no longer fit.

The final challenge takes place in an auditorium that is also a throat. You stand on a stage under lights that warm your skin and make your eyes shine. The audience is full of versions of yourself at different ages. The littlest one kicks her legs and dangles her feet, the oldest folds her hands in her lap and watches you like weather. “Tell us why you,” they say together, their voices braiding into a single rope you could climb or hang from. You open your mouth and everything you have built in the other rooms pours out: bridges you trusted, meals you crafted from intangible ingredients, portraits you touched, fields you crossed without stopping anything but fear.

You do not give them a speech. You tell them a story about the first time you knew what you wanted, sitting on a carpet that smelled like crayons, listening to someone explain how ideas become shelter. You tell them how you kept a notebook by your bed and woke to write half-formed thoughts in the margins of dreams like this one. You tell them that your dream job is not a job but a way of carrying a candle through a windy world and convincing the flame to stay.

Silence, then the sound of applause—soft at first, then swelling until it becomes rain. The ceiling opens and the rain falls and each drop contains a tiny reflection of your face, all of them laughing for slightly different reasons. A judge steps forward holding a ribbon made of horizon. “You win,” they say, and the ribbon wraps around your wrist and tugs you forward.

You think it will pull you onto a stage or into an office with plants that thrive on benign neglect, but it pulls you instead into a morning. The auditorium fades to a pale room. The field of clocks becomes a bedside table with one gentle digital blink. The bridge collapses back into the gap between sleeping and waking. But the ribbon is still around your wrist, and when you lift your hand, there is a faint line where it lay, like a tan line from a sun you’d almost forgotten.

Outside your window, the day is waiting. You can still taste curiosity on your tongue. You sit up, reach for a pen, and, almost without thinking, write down the challenges you already passed. Then you begin working on the first small task of your real day as if the dream were a rehearsal, as if the grand prize were not an object to be handed to you but a path you have already learned to walk without stopping time. And as you start, you realize the competition never ended; it simply changed venues. The judges are gone. The audience is gone. What remains is the sound of your own voice, steady now, and the echo of rain like applause you can carry in your pocket whenever the wind rises.
