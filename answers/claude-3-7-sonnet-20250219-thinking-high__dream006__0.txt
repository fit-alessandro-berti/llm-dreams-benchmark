You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to realize your notes have disappeared. Panic rises in your chest as you reach into your pocket, finding only a small seashell instead of your carefully prepared speech.

Strangely, when you look up again, the audience has doubled in size, and you recognize faces from different parts of your life—childhood friends, former teachers, even people you're certain you've never met before.

As you open your mouth to speak, your voice emerges not as words but as music, a melody you somehow know perfectly despite never having heard it before. The crowd doesn't seem confused; they begin swaying in unison.

The stage beneath your feet gradually transforms into water, but you don't sink—you're standing on its surface. Your anxiety dissolves as you find yourself effortlessly delivering the most important speech of your life, though you can't later recall a single word of what you said.

When you finish, the audience transforms into a flock of bright birds that spiral upward through the suddenly roofless auditorium, disappearing into a twilight sky that wasn't there moments ago. You feel an inexplicable sense of accomplishment as you float gently from the stage.
