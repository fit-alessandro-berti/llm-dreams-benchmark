…begin to feel an odd lightness in my legs, like the floor has turned to warm water. The microphone in my hand starts stretching, elongating like taffy, until it’s a gleaming silver snake coiled around my wrist. I try to speak, but instead of words, tiny origami cranes spill from my mouth, fluttering out over the audience in perfect silence.

The crowd doesn’t gasp or laugh; they simply open their umbrellas (thousands of them, black and red and polka-dot) as the paper cranes rain down. Each crane lands on an umbrella and instantly becomes a real bird, chirping the exact note I was supposed to start my speech with. The sound builds into a chord, then a symphony, and I realize I’m no longer on the stage.

I’m floating above it, barefoot, wearing a tuxedo made entirely of stage lights. The spotlight itself has become a warm sun, and I’m orbiting it like a very nervous moon. Below me, the audience has turned into a sea of clocks, all ticking backward. One of them (an old grandfather clock in the front row) stands up, clears its throat with a loud *gong*, and says in my mother’s voice:

“Well? We’re waiting.”

I open my mouth again. This time, the entire speech pours out at once (every word I’ve ever known, every secret I’ve never told, every grocery list and childhood phone number) in a single beam of golden light that shoots straight up through the ceiling and punches a perfect circular hole in the sky.

Through that hole, I can see tomorrow’s weather, last week’s regrets, and the exact moment I forgot to zip my fly.

The clocks applaud with their hands (which have suddenly grown out of their faces). The origami birds form a crown above my head. And just as I’m about to bow, the stage beneath me turns into my childhood bed, and I fall upward into it, sheets wrapping around me like loving arms.

The last thing I hear before waking is the grandfather clock whispering:

“Encore tomorrow night, kid. You killed it.”
