...and you freeze. The office hums with fluorescent light, but it sounds like bees trapped in glass. Your desk—usually familiar, cluttered with half-dead pens and yesterday’s coffee mug—feels alien. The project folder in your boss’s hand isn’t paper; it’s made of shifting, iridescent scales that peel away like old paint.  

"Start now," your boss says, but their voice echoes from the ceiling vents. You open the folder. Inside isn’t a brief—it’s a live hummingbird, wings beating so fast it blurs into a clock face. *Tick-tick-tick.* The deadline isn’t tomorrow. It’s *now*.  

You reach for your keyboard, but the keys are melting into black licorice. Your fingers sink into the goo, sticky and warm. Around you, coworkers type frantically, but their screens show only static snow and the words: **"YOU ARE LATE."**  

Then—a whisper from the potted fern in the corner: *"Plant your feet."* You look down. Your shoes have taken root, tendrils snaking into the carpet. The hummingbird-clock flutters onto your shoulder, its beak tapping your temple: *Think. Breathe. Begin.*  

You close your eyes. When you open them, the folder is just paper again. The hummingbird is a paperclip. Your boss is gone. The deadline? Still impossible. But your hands—no longer stuck—hover over the keyboard. You type one word. Then another. The roots recede. The bees quiet.  

And somewhere, deep in the dream, you remember: *You’ve survived impossible before.*  

You keep typing.
