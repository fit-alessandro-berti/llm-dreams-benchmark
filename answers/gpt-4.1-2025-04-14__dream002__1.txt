hear thunder rumbling in the distance. Leaves begin to swirl around your feet as a cold wind whips through the trees. The sky darkens quickly, branches creaking overhead. You notice a faint golden light flickering deeper in the woods, drawing you forward.

As you hurry toward the light, fat raindrops begin to fall, but curiously, they never quite touch you—they vanish before they reach your skin. The forest floor becomes soft and springy, like a carpet, muffling the sound of your footsteps.

At last, you reach a small clearing where the golden light comes from a lantern hanging in midair, with no one holding it. Underneath the lantern sits a wooden bench, dry and inviting amid the downpour. As you sit, the storm’s noise softens to a gentle lull, and you realize you are surrounded by glowing fireflies, swirling in a slow dance.

Suddenly, the branches part above you, revealing a perfect circle of star-filled sky. The rain stops. The world feels hushed and expectant, as if waiting for you to speak—or perhaps to remember something important you’ve forgotten.
