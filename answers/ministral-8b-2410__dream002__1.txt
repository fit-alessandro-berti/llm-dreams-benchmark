The wind picks up, howling through the trees. The once tranquil forest becomes a symphony of rustling leaves and creaking branches. You quicken your pace, trying to find shelter. Suddenly, you see a small, cozy cottage nestled among the trees. You rush towards it, the rain starting to pour down, drenching you in seconds.

Reaching the cottage, you push open the door and step inside. The cottage is warm and dry, filled with the scent of fresh bread and woodsmoke. A kind-faced old woman, wearing an apron, greets you with a warm smile. "Come in, dear," she says, "You're just in time for tea."

She pours you a steaming cup of tea and hands you a towel to dry off. You sit down by the fire, feeling the warmth seep into your bones. The storm rages outside, but inside, you feel safe and at peace. The old woman starts telling you tales of the forest, its spirits, and its secrets. You listen, enraptured, as the storm continues to batter the cottage, but you no longer feel afraid. You're exactly where you need to be.
