... written in an alien script, a jumble of strange symbols and glyphs that morph every time you try to focus on them. You feel a trickle of sweat running down your spine, and the weight of the watchful eyes of the invigilator pressing down on you.

Frantically, you flip through the pages, but it’s as if the words dance away from your grasp, swirling into incomprehensible patterns. The classroom, once familiar, now seems to stretch on endlessly, rows upon rows of students disappearing into the horizon.

Your heart is racing, and the ticking of the clock sounds unnaturally loud, the hands spinning wildly in a blur. The other students are scribbling answers, oblivious to the nonsensical script.

In your pocket, you feel the shape of a strange device you don't remember acquiring. You pull it out, and it's a small, intricate translator with a screen showing the real questions. Relief washes over you, but as you start to use it, the device sputters and dies, leaving you in silent desperation.

You look up to see the invigilator transformed into a towering figure, a shadow with eyes that glow with an otherworldly light. "Time is running out," it booms, the voice echoing as if from the depths of a vast cavern.

Suddenly, a classmate you’ve never met before whispers, "We create our own reality here." Your eyes meet, and in that moment, understanding flows through you like a wave. You close your eyes and envision the questions in your native language, their meaning clear and precise.

When you open your eyes, the paper is no longer a canvas of cryptic shapes but a series of questions you can answer with confidence. The anxiety melts away, replaced by a calm certainty. You begin to write, and each answer flows freely from your pen, the dream bending to your newfound resolve.

As you write the final word, the dream space shatters like glass, and you wake up with a start, the lingering feeling of triumph tinged with the surreal certainty that the dream may have held more than just imagination.
