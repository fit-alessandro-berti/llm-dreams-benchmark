... written in a language you've never seen before. It wasn't ancient, not any language you recognized from your studies. Strange symbols, almost hieroglyphic in their complexity, danced across the page, a cryptic dance of nervousness and dread. This was it. The culmination of your academic journey rested in these swirling, enigmatic letters.

I glanced around the exam hall. Everyone else seemed to be breezing through, confidently scribbling away their answers on pristine scrolls, their brows unfurrowed, pens gliding smoothly across the paper. Me? Mine was scribbled with a mix of confusion and mild panic.

The questions were not in words, but in images. Images that shifted and morphed before my eyes, becoming more abstract with every blink. One question depicted a tangled web of code, a swirling whirlpool of bits and bytes. A voice whispered in my head, my mind, associating the code with numbers, whispered code,

another question showed a balance scale tipped precariously towards a side labeled "Artistry" with mirrored weights on the other side representing my overflowing inbox of art project applications and a single, scarlet rose lying on it, wilting. The formality of the written test, which had always been your biggest fear, seemed to slip into a strange caricature of reality.

These **were** the exams your chosen career path hinged upon, yes, but these weren't the traditional tests of skill you'd mastered to prepare for. These questions, symbols, felt strangely abstract, their meaning hidden behind a veil of sculpted dreams and phantom anxieties. This is your last chance I thought, my heart pounding against my ribs like a trapped bird.

The questions beckoned, but they were no longer bound by the rigid walls of text. Instead, they tauted me with their riddles. 

Each page was a kaleidoscope of shifting messages, a dizzying mix of abstract art and shifting coded glyphs. Was this some elaborate art code? My mind raced. My thought suddenly jumped to **Offerings of comfort, of acceptance, even of love**—themes my anxiety, hopefully, couldn't twist into a career-defining test of abstract, chaotic thought. 


Washcloth pressed against my forehead, I intently stared at the votive light flickering before me, its flame symbolizing the burning pressure in my chest. A wave of nausea washed over, and my flickering vision focused on a single, persistent image: a distorted painting of a rose, its petals turning into knots of fear instead of blooming.

I had studied all the "ancient art of" questions. I knew the paintings, the plans, the stories, I'd mastered them all. But this… this dwelling on the image of a struggling rose, I realized, was in itself a test. It wasn't just the test I was taking that mattered, I think it over and its implications sunk in heavier.

I'm being manipulated.

The test questions I'd been dreading **hadn't **sprouted yet. I quickly flipped 

through the first few pages, taking in the swirling shapes and textures. The symbols, fragmented and incomplete, just wouldn't make sense.  

"Look carefully," this voice said, echoing the strange chill in my bones.  

"You have to think outside the box."

Suddenly, a clarity pierced through the fog of my growing nervousness. The symbols were art, but they weren't just pretty pictures. They were…me. The paper rustled, and the pages shifted relentlessly

through my mind, morphing into a clearer pattern.

The first question emerged at the top of the pile, now a recognizable image clearly depicting a red rose tangled in thorns: 

**"Each thorn a lesson," a voice rasped, "each petal a dream…"**

The memories flooded back. The impossible, intricate pattern of the rose’s form. It

wasn’t just roses; there were thorns that reflected the postal

service, the exposed tubes of paint swirling were they a message?

Or merely my fear taking new shapes?"

My gaze darted to the subsequent pages—now I knew, it

was the test. Each question was an intricate riddle, demanding a specific answer

from him. Big mistake, huge mistake,




using a visual metaphor even more dissenting than the previous ones I'd

seen. 

They were blurred, a strange watercolor of a concept forming



Another test with thorns instead of words.

A chilling dread crept in, pinching at my mind like another thorn

on the rose—maybe the meaning of this final exam lay in the peculiar syntax of the questions,

the neologism required to decipher it.

My thoughts are radiating outwards


What are the questions?

The rose slowly blossomed in my mind, a vision

clarifying with each rustling turn of the page. From the swathe of stems and petals emerged

numbers. Instructions.

blooming with colorful flowers)**
