You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to walk away—just for a moment. You step outside into the cool night air, the world around you fading into a soft blur. The stars above seem to pulse like distant eyes watching, and the silence feels heavier than the argument itself.

As you stand there, something strange happens. The air shifts, and the world around you begins to dissolve—like ink in water. You feel a pull, not physical, but emotional, as if your mind is being drawn into a place where thoughts and feelings take shape.

Suddenly, you're no longer outside. You're in a vast, empty space, like a dream within a dream. In front of you stands a version of your friend, but they’re not angry anymore. They look calm, almost serene, and they speak without words—your thoughts echo between you.

*"We’re both afraid,"* they say, not in words, but in feeling. *"We’re afraid of losing each other, of being wrong, of not being heard."*

You feel the weight of their fear, and it mirrors your own. In that moment, the argument doesn’t matter anymore. It was never really about the thing you were fighting over—it was about the fear beneath it.

You reach out, and they do too. Your hands meet, and the space around you begins to shimmer. The dream shifts again, and you find yourselves sitting on a bench in a quiet park, the sun setting behind you. The air is still, but now it’s peaceful.

You speak, not in anger, but in honesty. And this time, you listen.
