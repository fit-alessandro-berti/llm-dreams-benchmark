You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you feel a flicker of hope. They surround you with warm smiles and gentle voices, guiding you through the maze of streets with patient kindness. One person holds up a map, another points out landmarks, and a third shares stories of the city’s hidden gems. As you walk with them, the noise of the city seems to soften, and for the first time in a long while, you feel seen, heard, and not alone. They lead you to a place that feels familiar, though you can’t quite remember how you got there. When you finally stop, they turn to you and say, “You’re safe now.” And as you look around, the city no longer feels overwhelming—it feels like a story waiting to be discovered, and you’re ready to write the next chapter.
