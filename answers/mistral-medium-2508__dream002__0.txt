the air grows thick with the scent of ozone and damp earth. The once-gentle rustling of leaves turns into a frantic whisper as the wind howls through the branches, bending them like bows. Dark, bruise-colored clouds swallow the sky, and the temperature plummets—your breath fogs in front of you despite the humidity clinging to your skin.

A single drop of rain hits your cheek, cold as a needle. Then another. Within seconds, the forest is a curtain of silver threads, the downpour so dense it blurs the trees into ghostly smudges. Lightning splits the sky—a jagged, violet-white vein—and the thunderclap that follows shakes the ground beneath your feet. You stumble, your boots sinking into the suddenly muddy earth.

That’s when you see *it*.

Between the trunks of two ancient oaks, a figure stands perfectly still, as if the storm doesn’t touch them. They’re draped in tattered cloth the color of storm-worn stone, their face obscured by a hood—or perhaps by something darker, something that seems to *drift* like smoke where features should be. Their fingers (too long, too many?) twitch at their sides, and you realize the rain isn’t hitting them at all. It’s *parting* around them, as if they’re a rock in a river.

A voice slithers into your mind, not through your ears but *inside* them, vibrating in your bones:
*"You’ve walked the wrong path, little dreamer."*

The ground beneath you *shifts*. Roots burst from the soil like grasping hands, coiling around your ankles. The trees groan, their bark splitting to reveal eyes—dozens of them, glossy and black, blinking in the stormlight. The figure lifts a hand, and the rain *reverses*, droplets hurtling upward as if time itself is rewinding.

You try to run, but your legs won’t obey. The forest isn’t a forest anymore—it’s a living thing, breathing, watching. The figure steps closer, and their hood tilts just enough for you to see what’s underneath:

Not a face.
A *void*.
A swirling, star-flecked abyss that pulls at you like a tide, and you realize with dawning horror that you’ve seen this before—not in waking life, but in the corners of your dreams, in the static between thoughts. It’s the shape of the thing that watches you when you’re almost asleep.

*"Wake up,"* it murmurs. *"Or stay."*

The last thing you feel is the cold press of fingers (not fingers) against your forehead—
—and then you’re falling, but not down.
*In.*

**Do you:**
1. **Let go**—surrender to the void, curious (or desperate) to see what’s on the other side.
2. **Fight**—claw at the dream’s logic, scream yourself awake, even if it means your heart might burst from the effort.
3. **Bargain**—whisper a secret, a name, or a memory so precious even the storm might hesitate to take you.
4. **Do something else** (describe it).

*(The dream isn’t over until you choose.)*
