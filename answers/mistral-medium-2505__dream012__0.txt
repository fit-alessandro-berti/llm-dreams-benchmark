**Dream Completion:**

You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you stand firm at the helm, gripping the wheel with both hands. The wind howls like a vengeful spirit, and the waves rise like mountains, threatening to swallow your vessel whole.

But then—something shifts.

A faint glow appears on the horizon, cutting through the storm like a beacon. It pulses with an eerie, otherworldly light, and the waves seem to part around it as if in reverence. Your crew gasps, some in awe, others in fear. You squint through the rain, trying to make sense of it.

Is it a lighthouse? A mirage? Or something… else?

The ship drifts toward the light, as if pulled by an unseen force. The storm quiets, the winds still, and the sea becomes glassy smooth. Then, from the glow, a figure emerges—a spectral sailor, clad in tattered robes, their face obscured by shadow. They raise a skeletal hand and point toward the depths.

A voice, neither human nor beast, echoes in your mind: *"The storm is not your enemy. It is the sea’s way of testing you."*

And then—you wake up.

**Interpretation (if you'd like one):**
This dream could symbolize a challenge in your waking life where you feel responsible for guiding others through uncertainty. The storm represents chaos or fear, while the mysterious light and figure suggest hidden wisdom or an unexpected solution. The message may be that obstacles are not just threats but tests of your strength and leadership.
