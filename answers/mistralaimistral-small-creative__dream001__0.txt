**Dream Continuation:**

You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour—but no idea where it is. The streets hum with a strange, electric energy, the air thick with the scent of rain-soaked pavement and something faintly metallic, like old coins or a distant subway. The buildings around you are towering, their facades shifting subtly when you blink—brick turning to glass, then to something smooth and organic, like polished bone. The sky is a deep, bruised purple, streaked with clouds that move too fast, as if time itself is unraveling.

You check your pockets. No phone. No wallet. Just a single, crumpled business card with a name—*"Dr. Elias Vey"*—and an address: **"The Obsidian Spire, Level 7, Room 13."** The ink bleeds slightly when you touch it, as if the card is alive. You turn it over, and on the back, in a handwriting that isn’t yours, are the words: *"Don’t trust the reflections."*

A clock tower in the distance chimes—once, twice—though you don’t remember hearing it before. You have 58 minutes.

### **The City Reacts**
As you step forward, the streetlamps flicker in unison, their light pulsing like a slow heartbeat. A woman in a long, silver coat passes you, her face obscured by a veil of shifting static. She pauses, tilts her head, and says, *"You’re late."* Then she’s gone, dissolved into the crowd like mist.

You ask a street vendor for directions. He’s selling what look like glowing oranges, their peels peeling back to reveal tiny, watching eyes. He grins, teeth too white, too many. *"The Spire? Oh, you don’t want to go there. Not today."* He points down an alley where the shadows move *against* the light. *"But if you must, take the bridge. Mind the toll."*

The alley leads to a narrow stone bridge arching over a black canal. The water isn’t water—it’s a slow, viscous liquid, like oil or melted tar, and faces float just beneath the surface, mouths opening and closing silently. At the midpoint of the bridge stands a figure in a tattered suit, his back to you. He’s feeding something to the canal—small, writhing things that squirm before sinking. He turns. His face is yours.

*"Took you long enough,"* he says. *"You have 50 minutes. The Spire doesn’t like waiters."*

### **The Choice**
He holds out a key—old, rusted, with teeth that look like tiny, gnashing mouths. *"This’ll get you in. But you’ll have to leave something behind."* He nods at the canal. The faces in the water are yours now, all of them screaming.

Do you:
1. **Take the key and ask what the toll is.** (The figure smirks. *"A memory. A small one. You won’t miss it."*)
2. **Refuse the key and try to find another way.** (The bridge groans. The water rises.)
3. **Jump into the canal.** (The faces part for you. The water is warm. *Too warm.*)
4. **Something else.** (The dream is yours. What do you do?)

---
### **The Spire Awaits**
If you take the key, the figure’s face melts like wax, revealing something smooth and featureless beneath. The key burns in your palm as you step into the Spire—a needle of black glass piercing the sky, its doors sealed with a lock that *breathes*. Inside, the air is thick with the scent of old books and something older, something that doesn’t have a name.

The elevator has no buttons. Only a mirror.

And in the mirror, Dr. Elias Vey is already waiting for you.

**How does the dream end?** (Or do you want to explore another path?)
