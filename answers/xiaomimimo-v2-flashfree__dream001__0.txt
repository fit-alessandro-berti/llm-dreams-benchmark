I start to run.

My feet pound against the pavement, which feels strangely soft, like walking on a mixture of asphalt and moss. The city towers above me, monolithic structures of glass and obsidian that stretch into a bruised purple sky. There are no street signs, only glowing glyphs that shift and change every time I blink.

I reach into my pocket and pull out my phone. The screen is cracked, but it lights up. Instead of a map, the GPS shows a single, pulsing red heart. It beats slowly, rhythmically. *Thump-thump. Thump-thump.*

I realize I have to follow the beat.

I sprint down an alleyway that smells of ozone and cinnamon. The walls seem to breathe, expanding as I pass so I can fit through the narrow gap. I burst out onto a plaza where gravity feels lighter. People are floating inches above the ground, holding briefcases made of light. They drift lazily, but I don't have time to join them. I need to be grounded.

The heart on my phone beats faster. *Thump-thump-thump.*

I turn left, jumping over a river that flows upward, spilling into the clouds. I climb a flight of stairs that rearranges itself like a puzzle, each step shifting to a new position the moment I lift my foot. I’m getting tired, my lungs burning, but the urgency is electric.

I check the phone again. The heart is frantic now, a blur of red. The GPS arrow spins wildly and then stops, pointing straight up.

I look up. I am standing at the base of the tallest tower, the one made of spun sugar and shadow. The meeting isn't on a floor I can walk to.

I grab the door handle. It’s warm. I turn it, and the door opens not into a lobby, but into the air.

I step out into nothingness, and I begin to fall upward.
