...rely on everything you half-remember from history class and camping trips. The air smells of smoke and damp earth. Oxen pull carts over rutted roads; the silhouettes of thatched roofs cut jagged shapes against a pale morning sky. Your hand pats your pockets instinctively for your phone, and the flat, empty fabric answers you with silence. The weight of it hits you – there are no screens to consult, no maps to pinch‑zoom. If you're going to eat, you'll have to find food. If you're going to sleep, you'll have to earn a bed or build one.

You pull your hoodie tighter, drawing curious stares. To them you are draped in strange cloth, your jeans dyed an impossibly even blue. You catch snippets of a language that sounds like the one you've heard shouted in fantasy films, all rolled r's and throaty consonants. You have no choice but to smile, to point at your mouth, at your empty stomach. A kind‑eyed woman selling loaves of black bread hesitates, then breaks one in half and presses it into your hands. You want to cry with gratitude. You nod and murmur "thank you" in a dozen languages until one of them earns an amused chuckle. Latin? Old French? Your brain rummages through its attic. This will be the first of a thousand small negotiations.

Days blur in the way they do in dreams. You learn quickly: how to coax tinder to flame with flint and steel, how to tell edible greens from their poisonous cousins, how to nod deferentially when men on horseback thunder past. You trade the knowledge of soap‑making for shelter; you sketch, in the dirt, the idea of a waterwheel to a skeptical miller who eyes you like a sorcerer. They call you "magus" when your little trick with herbs actually eases someone's fever. You are careful not to speak of germ theory or microchips. The thought of accidentally altering everything makes your stomach knot.

One evening, under a sky dark enough to drown in, you sit by a fire with your new companions. Sparks drift up like tiny stars returning home. You look at their rough, earnest faces and realize that for the first time since arriving, you are not afraid. Somewhere far away, in a different era, an alarm clock screams. You snap upright in your own bed, heart hammering, palms still smelling faintly of woodsmoke. The dream evaporates with the morning light, leaving behind an ache you can't quite name—and a sudden, absurd desire to learn how to make bread from scratch.
