…you drift toward a cluster of people gathered around a long table strewn with glowing fruit that pulses like tiny lanterns. They laugh in soft whispers, picking slices of mango and strawberry that vanish before they touch their tongues. You reach out, but your fingers pass through the fruit like mist.

Undeterred, you wander on, brushing past a circle of dancers in feathered masks. They move in perfect unison, stepping in spirals one moment and shattering into staccato leaps the next. Their eyes—though hidden—seem to follow you, beckoning you closer. Every time you pivot to find them, they have shifted positions, and you lose sight of where you started.

Ahead, a group of children sits on low stools, each holding a tiny bird in their hands. The birds sing fragments of songs you once knew but can’t recall. You lean in to listen, and for a split second the memory of your friend’s voice flickers in your mind. The children turn to you with serious faces, then nod and point down a corridor bathed in dusky rose light.

You follow, heart pounding, and enter a hall where people stand beneath chandeliers made of frozen soap bubbles. Each bubble contains a scene—a handshake, a tearful goodbye, a triumphant smile. You press your palm against one bubble and watch your own reflection wave back from inside. The image blurs, and the bubble drifts upward, popping with a soft sigh.

At the end of the corridor you find a single door carved with your initials. Beyond it, the room is empty except for a single chair. And there—seated calmly, turning in slow circles—is the one face you know. Relief floods you, but as you step forward, the chair rises into the air. Your friend smiles gently and extends a hand. You reach out—but just before your fingers meet, everything shimmers.

Light dissolves into sound, and you awake to the faint echo of laughter and the taste of vanished fruit on your tongue. You lie still for a moment, the dream’s last echo—a whispered “I found you”—fading as reality settles back in.
