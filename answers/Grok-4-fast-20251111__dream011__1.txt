...not questions at all, but riddles etched in glowing, shifting ink that dances like fireflies across the page. The first one reads: "If a tree falls in a forest and no one's around to hear it, does it make a sound? Bonus: What if the tree is made of forgotten passwords and the forest is your browser history?"

Your heart races— this isn't calculus or code; it's a cosmic prank. You glance around the exam hall, but the other students are melting into their desks, their faces morphing into clocks with hands spinning backward. The proctor, a towering owl in a tweed suit, hoots softly: "Time's an illusion, child. Answer with your soul."

Panic surges, but then you laugh—because in dreams, laughter is the ultimate cheat code. You scribble wildly: "The tree whispers secrets to the wind, and the sound is the echo of what we'll never Google." The ink sparkles, approving, and the page flips itself.

The next riddle blooms like a fractal flower: "Name the three fears that built the pyramids of your regrets." Your pen hovers, and suddenly, you're not in the hall anymore. You're atop a ziggurat under a sky of binary stars, the Nile below churning with lines of unfinished code. "Fear of failure," you write, feeling the stone warm beneath you. "Fear of flying solo." The pyramid shrinks, revealing a hidden chamber. "Fear of asking the wrong question." The door swings open, and inside? Not gold, but a mirror showing you—not as you are, but as you could be: a architect of worlds, debugging the universe one glitch at a time.

The owl returns, shedding its suit to reveal wings of circuit boards. "You've passed," it murmurs, voice like static on an old radio. "The career? Whatever dream you wake to chase." The exam dissolves into confetti, and you float upward, the riddles trailing like kites. As your eyes flutter open to the hum of your alarm, you smile—because the real test was never on paper. It was remembering to dream bigger than the questions.
