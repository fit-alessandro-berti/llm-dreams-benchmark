## Step 1: Define the problem
The problem is to compute the sum of all integers from 1 to n.

## Step 2: Choose a method
We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = n * (n + 1) / 2, where n is the upper limit.

## Step 3: Write the formula
The formula to compute the sum of all integers from 1 to n is: sum = n * (n + 1) / 2.

## Step 4: Calculate the sum
Let's calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to n using the formula.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}}$
