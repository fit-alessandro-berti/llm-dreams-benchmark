gratefully accept their assistance. As you walk with them through the crowded streets, you notice that the buildings around you transform into towering trees, their branches weaving together to create a canopy above. The city noise fades into gentle birdsong, and the air is filled with the scent of blooming flowers.

The strangers, now seeming more like old friends, guide you along a winding path that leads you to a tranquil clearing. In the center of this space stands a beautiful, ornate fountain, its waters sparkling in the dappled sunlight. As you approach, one of your companions hands you a silver coin and invites you to make a wish.

You close your eyes, feeling a sense of belonging and peace as you toss the coin into the fountain. The ripples it creates seem to dance, catching the light and reflecting a myriad of colors. When you open your eyes, the strangers are gone, but their warmth and kindness remain with you, and you no longer feel lost or alone. Instead, you stand confident and content, knowing that you have the power to find your way in both dreams and waking life.
