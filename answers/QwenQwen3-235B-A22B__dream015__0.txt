**You decide to** journey toward the distant mountains, where whispers on the radio spoke of a sanctuary—a place where the earth still bore fruit and the air didn’t burn your lungs. The map you’d scavenged from a dead traveler’s coat was half-erased by rain, but the jagged peaks were unmistakable. You packed what little you had: a rusted knife, a canteen of murky water, and a photograph of someone you couldn’t remember, their face blurred by time or trauma.  

The road was a graveyard of rusted cars and hollowed-out buildings, their windows like eye sockets staring at the ash-choked sky. You moved at night to avoid the scavenger gangs, their fires flickering in the ruins like malevolent stars. Once, you stumbled upon a child’s doll lying in the road, its button eyes gleaming in the moonlight. You picked it up, not sure why—maybe because it reminded you of the sister you’d lost, or maybe because holding something small and broken made the vast, broken world feel less infinite.  

On the third day, you found a dog. Or it found you. Scrawny, with one ear and a collar that read *“Max”* in peeling paint. It limped beside you without asking, and you didn’t either. Together, you crossed the salt flats where the ground cracked like old bone, and you dreamed of oceans that no longer existed.  

When you finally reached the mountains, the air was thinner, sharper, and the silence felt like a held breath. The sanctuary wasn’t a sanctuary at all—just a crumbling monastery perched on a cliff, its gates barred, its walls scarred by claw marks. But there, carved into the rock below, was a message: **“They went underground.”**  

You knelt, digging your fingers into the dirt until you found the metal hatch. Cold air hissed out, carrying the scent of damp earth and something sweet—like rot or roses. Max growled, low and steady.  

You hesitated. The photograph in your pocket suddenly felt heavier.  

*What waits below?*  

And do you still care, if it means never being alone again?

The dream lingers, unresolved, as the hatch creaks open…
