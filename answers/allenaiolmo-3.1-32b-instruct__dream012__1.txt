must make a choice. The waves crash over the deck, rain stings your eyes, and the wind howls like a living thing. You grip the wheel tightly, feeling the weight of your crew's trust. Lightning flashes, illuminating the anxious faces of your sailors. You call out above the roar, your voice steady despite the chaos. "Hold fast, everyone! Trust the ship, and trust each other! We'll ride out the worst—keep to your stations and secure the rigging!" As the storm intensifies, you search the horizon for a break in the tempest, praying for calm, determined to lead your crew through the darkness until the dawn breaks and the sea surrenders once more.
