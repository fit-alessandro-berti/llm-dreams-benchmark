As I stand there, my boss hovering expectantly, the impossible deadline feels like a physical weight crushing my chest. The project—redesigning the entire company’s app in 48 hours with a skeleton team—looms like a mirage in a desert. I open my mouth to protest, but no sound comes out.  

Suddenly, the office walls melt away, replaced by a chaotic kaleidoscope of floating code, tangled wires, and giant, ticking clocks. My boss’s face stretches into a surreal grin, his voice echoing like a funhouse mirror: “Tick-tock! The client’s shuttle leaves Earth orbit at dawn!”  

I reach for my coffee for courage, but the mug dissolves into a swarm of glowing pixels. Panic surges—then, a whisper: *“Breathe.”* I turn to see my mentor, long retired, materializing from a hologram of binary rain. He taps a floating keyboard. “The deadline’s a test. Look *under* the panic.”  

I squint. The tangled wires rearrange into a shimmering map of the app’s architecture. Deadlines become bridges, each labeled with a colleague’s skill: Maya (design), Raj (backend), Elena (testing). My mentor grins. “You’re not alone. Just… *ask*.”  

I gasp—and jolt awake at my desk. Sunlight streams through the blinds. No boss. No ticking clocks. Just the quiet hum of my computer. On my screen: a single email from my mentor, sent at 3 a.m.  

*Subject: Midnight Test Passed*  
*Body: You figured it out. Start with Maya. She’s already sketching.*  

I glance at the calendar. The deadline? Still 48 hours away. But the crushing weight is gone.  

I hit reply: *“Let’s build the bridge.”*  

The dream ends not with stress, but with the electric thrill of a puzzle clicking into place—and the first step toward making the impossible *possible*.
