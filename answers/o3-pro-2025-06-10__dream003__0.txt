…interlocking sigils, each no bigger than a grain of rice, spiraling around a faintly glowing seam. When you glide a fingertip across the carvings, they rearrange beneath your touch—stone flowing like mercury—until the symbols form a shape you dimly recognize: the constellation you used to trace on bedroom ceilings as a child.

In the hush that follows, the air hums. A strand of golden light leaks from the seam, curling upward like smoke, and with it comes a perfume of wet soil after rain. The box suddenly feels warm, almost alive, as if pulsing with a heartbeat that is not entirely separate from your own.

Instinct overrides logic. You whisper the childhood rhyme you always sang to quell nightmares. The final syllable hangs in the stillness, and every sigil flares once, then settles into place—click. The lid unfurls not outward but inward, collapsing through itself like an Escher staircase until it reveals an interior that should be impossible: a vast interior sky streaked with sapphire clouds and silver birds wheeling soundlessly.

You lean closer. Gravity sighs and rearranges; down is now forward. Without a second thought, you step through the lid and land on a carpet of luminous moss that releases soft blue spores at your footfall. Ahead, a river of mirrored glass flows uphill. Phosphorescent koi dart within it, their scales spelling words in languages you almost—but don’t quite—understand. One koi breaches, and for a heartbeat its eyes carry your own reflection before splashing back.

A wooden signpost sprouts beside the river, pointing in three directions:

1. “Toward the Answer You’re Afraid Of”
2. “Toward the Memory You Misplaced”
3. “Toward the Door Home (If You Still Want It)”

You choose the second path. The mirrored river coils around you, guiding your steps until you arrive at a grove of towering books—each trunk is a spine, each leaf a fluttering page. In the largest volume an indentation waits, exactly the size and shape of your hand. You press your palm there. The page–leaves riffle in a cyclone, revealing an illustration of your first lost tooth, the moment you let it slip between floorboards and convinced yourself it never existed.

A single page tears free, drifts down, folds itself into a tiny ivory key, and lands in your palm. Before doubt can bloom, the world inhales, pulling you backward through forest, river, sky, until you stand again before the original box, now closed.

The key glows, but instead of fitting it into a lock, you place it on your tongue—intuition, again. It dissolves like spun sugar. A warmth spreads through your chest, radiating outward until light pours from your fingertips. The box responds: its walls turn transparent, revealing not treasure, but a crystal mirror. In its depths, you see a version of yourself already holding the unlocked box, smiling knowingly.

Then the mirror-self leans forward and whispers a single word—too soft to hear, yet you understand it completely: “Wake.”

Your eyes open in your own room. On your nightstand rests a slip of paper folded into the shape of a tiny ivory key, glinting in the morning sun.
