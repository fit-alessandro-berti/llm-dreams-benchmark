Thank you for sharing your dream scenario. Here's a continuation:

You feel a flicker of hope as the group of strangers approaches. One of them notices your worried expression and gently asks if you need assistance. You nod, hesitating at first, but then feeling reassured by their friendly smiles. They pull out a crumpled map and start pointing out landmarks, guiding you through the crowded streets. As you walk together, they share stories about the city, making you laugh and forget your worries. Gradually, the towering buildings seem less intimidating, and you begin to feel a sense of belonging. Soon, you're not just following strangers—you’re sharing a moment of genuine connection amidst the chaos, realizing that even in a vast city, kindness can lead you home.
