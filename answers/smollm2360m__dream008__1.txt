Ah, I don't see any team members or colleagues around. How intriguing. You must be under enormous stress as well. 

This situation seems utterly surreal. Is this something that truly happens in your workplace? I don't recall such an event before. 

I've noticed the room is quite dark and stuffy with no windows, but how does one find ventilation at all? It's just so dense with fumes and whatnot.

Who can be this person who needs to start immediately? Are they high-ranking or junior? I feel like my mind has been turned on a loop by being in this nightmare space of yours.
