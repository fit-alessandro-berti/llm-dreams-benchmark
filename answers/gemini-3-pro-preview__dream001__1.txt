...panic, frantically patting your pockets for a phone that suddenly feels like it’s made of wet clay. You pull it out to check the address, but the screen dissolves into a swirl of neon paint, and the numbers slide off the glass like raindrops.

You look up, hoping to find a street sign, but the skyscrapers are bending over like wilting flowers, whispering to each other in a language that sounds like cello strings. You start running, but the gravity has shifted; every step launches you ten feet into the air in slow motion.

A bus pulls up, floating inches off the ground. It is driven by a giant, ticking pocket watch. You scramble aboard, breathless.

"Does this go to the meeting?" you ask.

The passengers turn to look at you. They are all people you went to high school with, but they are wearing diving helmets filled with goldfish.

"The meeting was yesterday," they say in unison, their voices bubbling through the water. "And you aren't wearing any shoes."

You look down. Your feet have turned into tree roots, and they are rapidly growing into the floorboards of the bus, rooting you in place as the vehicle accelerates straight up into a purple sky.
