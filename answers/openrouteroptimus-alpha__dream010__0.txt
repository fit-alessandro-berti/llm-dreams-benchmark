strange obstacles—one moment, you’re eloquently solving riddles posed by talking animals, and the next, you’re building an elaborate paper bridge over a shimmering, bottomless chasm with only a ticking clock for company. The audience in the stands—faces shifting between familiar mentors and figures from forgotten childhood books—cheers in voices that sound like a distant, harmonious wind.

Each round, the host (who alternates between your best friend and that barista you’ve only ever greeted) hands you a card with your next challenge. For one, you must rapidly organize a parade of ideas, leading bright thoughts past judges waiting to catch any that falter. For another, you assemble a puzzle made of glowing pieces shaped like past ambitions and future hopes, each one slotting perfectly in only when you recall a lesson learned.

The final challenge is cryptic: you have to “convince the mirror.” You step up to a tall, ornate mirror, your reflection shifting through different versions of you—each dressed for a different role. At first, their gazes seem doubtful, but as you speak about your passions and perseverance, their confidence grows. They nod in unison, and the mirror door swings open, flooding the arena with golden light.

You step through—and awake, your heart pounding with the sense that, somewhere, you’ve already won.
