...reach into the air between us and physically grab the argument itself. It materializes as a tangled, glowing mass of threads—some red-hot, some ice-cold, all vibrating with our voices. 

I hold it up. It pulses like a living thing, humming with phrases we've hurled at each other. My friend stares, not at me anymore, but at the writhing knot in my hands. Without speaking, we both understand what needs to be done.

We start pulling it apart together, careful not to break any thread. Each strand dissolves into a memory—camping trips, 3am confessions, the time they brought me soup when I was sick. The angry words are just knots in the good stuff. When we get to the last tangle, it becomes a single, shimmering question mark that floats up and pops like a soap bubble.

The silence that follows tastes like rain. My friend is suddenly standing much closer, or maybe the room got smaller. They hand me a cup of tea that I don't remember them making. The mug has no handle, which seems perfectly normal.

"Same dream?" they ask.

"Same dream," I confirm, and we both wake up.
