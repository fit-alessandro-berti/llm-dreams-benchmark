panic slightly, your heart racing as you glance around the towering buildings, their glass facades reflecting a kaleidoscope of colors from the setting sun. The streets buzz with people, all moving with purpose, while you stand still, clutching a crumpled note in your hand that simply reads, "The Tower, 6 PM." No address, no directions—just a name and a time that’s ticking closer.
You take a deep breath and decide to ask for help. You approach a street vendor selling glowing, iridescent flowers that hum faintly as they sway in the breeze. "Excuse me," you say, "do you know where The Tower is?" The vendor, an elderly woman with eyes like polished obsidian, smiles cryptically and points toward a narrow alleyway you hadn’t noticed before. "Through there," she says, "but mind the shadows—they like to play tricks."
With little choice, you thank her and head into the alley. The walls seem to pulse faintly, as if alive, and the air grows thick with a sweet, unplaceable scent. As you walk, the alley twists and stretches, and you hear whispers—soft, overlapping voices that seem to come from nowhere and everywhere. You catch fragments: "Turn left… no, right… you’re late… hurry…" Unsure what to trust, you pick up your pace, the meeting looming in your mind.
Suddenly, the alley opens into a plaza, and there it is: The Tower. It’s impossibly tall, spiraling into the sky like a thread of smoke frozen in time, its surface shimmering with symbols you can’t quite read. A clock embedded in its base ticks down—ten minutes to go. You rush toward the entrance, but as you reach it, the doors slide open to reveal not a lobby, but a vast, starry void. A figure floats within, cloaked in light, and beckons you forward. "You’re just in time," they say, their voice echoing in your skull. "Step in—we’ve been waiting."
You hesitate, the edge of the void pulling at your feet, and then—do you step in? What happens next? I’ll let you decide how this dream unfolds from here. What do you think?
