You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you **notice that their faces shimmer with an almost imperceptible, soft, golden light, like sunlight filtering through ancient stained glass.**

One of them, a woman with eyes the color of deep amethyst, gently takes your hand. Her touch is surprisingly warm and steadying. "Don't worry," she says, her voice a melodic murmur that cuts through the cacophony of the city, "We know these streets better than the mapmakers."

As they lead you, the city around you begins to transform. The towering skyscrapers don't shrink, but the noise fades, replaced by the sound of flowing water. The concrete sidewalks soften underfoot, becoming pathways paved with smooth, moss-covered stones. The harsh neon signs of the shops begin to glow with the quiet luminescence of fireflies caught in glass jars.

You realize they aren't just navigating the physical maze; they are guiding you through the *feeling* of being lost.

The group—there are five of them now, each radiating a unique sense of calm—begins to share small, simple items with you.

The first hands you a perfectly ripe, impossibly red apple that tastes like the memory of a perfect summer afternoon. Eating it fills you not with nourishment, but with a sudden, sharp clarity about a decision you've been struggling with in waking life.

The second hands you a tiny, intricately folded paper crane. When you unfold it, it doesn't reveal a message, but a feeling of profound acceptance washing over you—the acceptance of your current state, wherever you are.

The third simply points to the sky, where the familiar grey clouds have parted to reveal not the sun, but a vast, slow-moving nebula of colors you've never seen before—a silent, cosmic confirmation that you are part of something infinitely larger than this city street.

You look back at the woman with amethyst eyes. "Where are we going?" you ask, your voice barely a whisper, now devoid of panic.

She smiles, the golden light around her intensifying just slightly. "We are taking you to the place where you remember why you started walking in the first place."

And then, the ground beneath your feet begins to tilt gently. You don't fall; instead, you begin to float upward, drawn by an invisible current toward a single, glowing doorway that has materialized between two buildings that weren't there a moment ago. The kind strangers release your hand, waving farewell, their golden light receding as you drift toward the door, ready to step through and find the answer to the question you didn't even know you were asking.

**You cross the threshold, and the sensation is not of waking up, but of remembering a name you’ve always known.**
