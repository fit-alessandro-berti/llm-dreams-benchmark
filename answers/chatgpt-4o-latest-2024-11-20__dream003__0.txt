symbols etched into its surface, glowing faintly as though alive with an otherworldly energy. The symbols seem to shift and rearrange themselves as you focus on them. Strangely, you feel an inexplicable connection to the box, as if it knows you. 

Suddenly, you hear a soft whisper—not in the air, but inside your mind. It says, "What is lost can be found, if only you remember." Confused, you try to recall what you might have forgotten, but your mind feels foggy, like pages of a book that have been blurred.

Instinctively, you trace your fingers along the glowing patterns on the box. As you do, images flash before your eyes—memories you don’t recognize but feel hauntingly familiar. A dense forest drenched in golden light. A crumbling stone archway covered in vines. A mirror reflecting a version of yourself you’ve never seen before. 

The whispers grow louder, guiding your hand to press on specific parts of the box’s surface. When you press the final symbol, a soft click resonates from within, and the lid slowly creaks open. 

Inside, you find a small, silver key that reflects fragments of light like tiny stars. Next to it, there’s a folded piece of parchment. As you carefully unfold it, you realize it’s a map—but not just any map. It moves, shifting and changing with a life of its own. A faint golden trail appears on the map, leading to a place marked only by an ancient symbol—one that looks eerily similar to the tattoos on your forearm that you don’t remember getting.

Before you have time to think, the ground beneath you begins to tremble, and the world around you dissolves into swirling light. You feel yourself being pulled toward something—somewhere. The key in your hand grows warm, almost pulsing, as if responding to your heartbeat.

When the light fades, you find yourself standing at the edge of the golden forest from your vision, the map still in your hand. The trail glows brighter now, urging you forward. In the distance, you can hear faint music, soft and melancholic, calling to you like an old, forgotten melody.

What lies ahead is both thrilling and terrifying, but one thing is certain: the answers you seek—and the truth about the box—are waiting for you beyond the trees.
