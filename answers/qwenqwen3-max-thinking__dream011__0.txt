...written in a language you’ve never seen before—swirling glyphs that shift like liquid mercury, rearranging themselves every time you blink. Panic prickles your skin. This wasn’t covered in the syllabus. You glance around the exam hall: rows of students scribble furiously, their pens moving in perfect unison, as if guided by an invisible conductor.  

Then you notice the clock. It’s not ticking forward—it’s *unspooling*. The minute hand spins backward, shedding fragments of time like petals. The air smells of ozone and burnt sugar.  

A crumpled note slides across your desk, unsigned. You unfold it to find a single sentence in your own handwriting:  
**"The questions aren’t on the page. They’re in the spaces between your breaths."**  

You close your eyes. In the silence behind your eyelids, you hear it—the soft hum of the *real* exam. Not about facts or formulas, but about the choices you’ve avoided. The career you’re meant for isn’t waiting in a job title… it’s hiding in the courage you haven’t used yet.  

When you open your eyes, the paper is blank. But your hands aren’t shaking anymore.  

You begin to write.
