**The Maze of Echoing Shadows**

As you solve the final mechanism of the last puzzle—a series of interlocking gears that hummed like a living thing—the wall before you groans open, revealing not another corridor, but a vast, circular chamber bathed in an eerie, shifting light. The air is thick with the scent of old parchment and something metallic, like blood dried too many times.

At the center of the chamber stands a **pedestal**, its surface carved with the same symbols you’ve seen repeated throughout the maze: spirals, eyes, and a serpent devouring its own tail. Resting atop it is a **mirror**, but not one of glass. Its surface ripples like liquid mercury, reflecting not your face, but *fragments*—glimpses of other versions of you, each frozen in a different moment of the maze. One version is screaming, another is laughing, a third is *already turning away*, as if it knows something you don’t.

A voice, neither male nor female, whispers from the walls themselves:
*"You have walked the path of the seeker. Now choose: the key, the door, or the hand that turns it."*

Before you can ask what that means, the chamber *shifts*. The walls begin to **breathe**, expanding and contracting like lungs. The symbols on the pedestal rearrange themselves into three distinct objects:

1. **The Key** – A skeletal hand, its fingers curled around a rusted iron key. When you look closer, the key’s teeth are *moving*, reshaping themselves into words you almost recognize.
2. **The Door** – A slab of black stone, seamless and cold, with no handle, no lock—just a single, pulsing vein of gold running down its center like a crack in reality.
3. **The Hand** – A disembodied palm, floating in midair, fingers splayed. It twitches, beckoning. When you reach out, it *pulls back*, as if testing your intent.

Then, the **mirror** speaks.

*"You think this is a test,"* it murmurs, *"but the maze has been testing itself. Every choice you made was a choice it made first. Every puzzle you solved was a question it asked long before you were born."*

The liquid surface of the mirror **ripples violently**, and suddenly, you see *yourself* standing on the other side—not as you are now, but as you were *before* the maze. Younger. Softer. *Afraid.*

That version of you is holding a **knife**.

The voice from the walls grows louder, urgent:
*"The maze is not a prison. It is a* **womb**.* And you are not the seeker. You are the* **answer**.* Now—*choose.*"*

The chamber falls silent. The air hums with anticipation.

**What do you do?**

- **Take the Key.** (But what does it unlock? And why does it feel like it’s *unlocking you*?)
- **Touch the Door.** (The gold vein pulses. Is it a way out… or a way *in*?)
- **Grasp the Hand.** (It’s warm. Alive. But whose hand is it, really?)
- **Shatter the Mirror.** (The other you is still holding that knife. What happens if the glass breaks?)
- **Do nothing.** (The maze is breathing. Maybe it’s waiting for you to *stop playing its game*.)

*(Or… is there another choice? The maze has been lying to you this whole time. What if the real puzzle was never the puzzles at all?)*
