You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you realize your keyboard is made of Jell-O, wobbling under your frantic fingers. Words melt into rainbow puddles on the screen, and your boss's face stretches like taffy, growing three extra eyes that blink in unison: "Hurry! The client's a volcano, and it's about to erupt!"

You dive under your desk for cover, but it transforms into a trampoline, bouncing you toward the ceiling where fluorescent lights buzz like angry bees. Your coworkers sprout wings—half eagle, half pigeon—and flap around chanting stock market quotes in reverse. The project file? It's a live octopus now, squirting ink that tastes like expired coffee and whispers deadlines in binary.

Panic surges as the walls dissolve into candy cane stripes, and you're sliding down a chocolate river of emails toward a meeting room abyss. Your boss hovers above, now a giant clock with arms for hands, ticking louder: "Ten seconds! Nine! Eight..." You grab a stapler that turns into a magic wand, shout "Abracadabra!"—and poof!

You wake up in your bed, heart pounding, staring at your alarm clock. It's 7:02 AM. Monday. Real life deadline: survive the coffee run. Sweet relief... or was it? 😴
