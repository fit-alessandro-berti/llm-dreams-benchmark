You start to run, but your legs feel heavy, as if you are wading through deep water. The cobblestones beneath your feet soften into moss, and the skyscrapers above you aren't made of steel and glass, but of stacked, glowing aquariums filled with silent, drifting fish. 

You check your watch, but the face has been replaced by a tiny compass needle spinning counter-clockwise. Panic flares, but then a street vendor hands you a silver key. When you take it, it dissolves into a flock of moths that flutter toward a narrow alleyway that wasn't there a moment ago. 

You follow them, the anxiety in your chest loosening with every step, replaced by a strange curiosity. At the end of the alley stands a door painted the exact color of your childhood bedroom wall. You open it. Inside, there is no boardroom, no clients, no agenda. There is only a single chair facing a window that looks out over a calm, violet ocean. 

You sit down. The hour expires. The phone in your pocket buzzes, but you don't answer it. You realize the meeting was never with them; it was with the quiet you've been avoiding. Then, the ocean rises to meet the window, swallowing the light, and you wake up.
