…are holding a coffee cup that’s *too hot*—so hot the ceramic is glowing faintly amber at the rim. Your fingers don’t burn, though. In fact, the heat feels familiar, like holding a sun-warmed stone.  

Then your boss speaks—but their voice is the low hum of a microwave starting up.  
*“The deadline’s not *impossible*, Sarah. It’s just… compressed. Like time in a particle accelerator.”*  

They slide a tablet across the desk. On it: a glowing 3D model of a *tornado* made of origami cranes, spinning in place. The cranes keep folding and unfolding mid-spin—each fold revealing a new line of code, a sketch, a quote from Rilke. The countdown at the top blinks: **23:59:58…**  

You realize: *This isn’t a project. It’s a conversation with time itself.*  
The cranes only fly if *you* believe the impossible is already halfway done.  
You look down. Your pen has turned into a feather.  
A single feather.  
And you’re holding it over the whirlwind of folded possibilities…  

*(The alarm on your phone chimes softly in the distance—but in this dream, the chime is the sound of a bell made from melted snow.)*  

What do you do? 🌪️🕊️
