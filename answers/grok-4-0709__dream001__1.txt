You start to panic, your heart racing as you weave through the bustling streets of this labyrinthine city. Towering skyscrapers twist like vines toward a sky that's an unnatural shade of lavender, and the crowds around you seem to blur into faceless shadows, whispering in languages that sound like echoes of your own thoughts.

Desperate, you flag down a passerby—a tall figure in a suit made of shimmering fish scales. "Excuse me," you stammer, "I have a meeting in an hour, but I don't know where. Can you help?" The figure turns, revealing eyes like swirling galaxies, and smiles with teeth of polished marble. "Ah, the meeting of forgotten dreams," it replies in a voice like rustling leaves. "Follow the river of ink; it flows uphill to the clock tower that ticks backward."

Confused but compelled, you spot a narrow alley where black ink indeed bubbles up from the cobblestones, defying gravity as it streams toward a distant spire. You chase it, your footsteps echoing unnaturally loud, and as you run, the city begins to shift—buildings fold like origami, streets rearrange into impossible mazes, and street signs spin like roulette wheels, flashing names like "Regret Avenue" and "What If Lane."

Finally, you reach the clock tower, its hands spinning counterclockwise, unraveling time itself. You burst through the door and find the meeting room: a circular chamber filled with versions of yourself from different ages—child you, elderly you, versions you never became. They're all seated around a table made of clouds, discussing... your life choices?

The eldest you looks up and grins. "You're just in time. We've been waiting for you to decide." But as you open your mouth to speak, the room dissolves into a flock of iridescent birds, carrying you skyward. You wake up laughing, the city's whispers fading into the morning light, wondering if the meeting ever really happened—or if it was always inside you.
