accept their offer, feeling a wave of relief wash over you. The strangers—three of them, dressed in warm, mismatched coats—lead you through the crowded streets with gentle hands on your shoulders, guiding you toward a quieter alleyway. The noise of the city fades as you step into a hidden courtyard, where the air smells of fresh bread and distant rain.

One of them, a woman with silver-streaked hair, smiles and says, *"You were never lost. You just needed to see the right path."* She hands you a small, worn compass that hums faintly in your palm. The needle doesn’t point north—it points toward a door at the far end of the courtyard, slightly ajar.

The others nod encouragingly, and you hesitate for only a moment before walking toward the door. As you push it open, the world outside shifts—no longer a city, but a vast, starry field where the sky is alive with swirling constellations. A voice, soft and familiar, whispers your name.

You realize then that this was never just a dream. It was an invitation.

What happens next?
