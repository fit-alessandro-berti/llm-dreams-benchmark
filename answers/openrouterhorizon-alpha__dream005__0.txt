you catch snippets of conversations that feel like radio stations tuning in and out. A woman in a green dress whispers, “We only dream in verbs,” and her laughter bumps against a man arguing softly with a ficus about time zones. A trio of friends are balancing teacups on their shoulders like tiny moons, and every spill leaves a constellation on the carpet.

You notice the floor is an old map printed on velvet, continents pilled and worn. Your friend’s name is written somewhere near the equator, but the letters keep scurrying away like minnows when you step closer. You apologize to a passing waiter carrying a tray of rain, and he nods as water patters onto the floor in the shape of your childhood hometown.

Someone calls your name from a balcony that didn’t exist a moment ago. When you look up, the ceiling is a sky, and the chandeliers are bright, captive jellyfish. A band begins to play, except the instruments are held by negative space: you can hear the trumpet, but there’s only the outline of a musician and the slick shine of spit valve light. The song is familiar in the way a smell is familiar—summer asphalt, the inside of a library book, the morning after a storm.

You pass a group of people speaking in polite numbers. “Seventeen,” says one, and they all murmur in agreement. “Prime,” says another with a blush, and everyone laughs as though at a clever joke. A man with paper hair leans toward you. “Have you seen them?” he asks. His fringe rustles like a paperback in a breeze. “They keep changing jackets.”

“Who?” you ask, but he’s already folding himself into an origami swan you’re suddenly holding by the neck. It feels warm, alive, and quietly humming a tune your ribcage recognizes.

You try to text your friend and your phone opens like a compact mirror. Your face is a little out of season: your eyes are winter, your mouth is July. You write their name on the glass with your fingertip and each letter sprouts legs and walks off, joining a conga line of nouns disappearing under a curtain. You lift the curtain; it reveals another curtain. They’re heavy and velvet, smelling faintly of oranges and static electricity, and as you push through them your hands come away glittering with dust like galaxies.

On the other side is a smaller party inside the big party. Everyone is exactly the right height for your heart. They’re toasting with cups of ocean; when you drink, a tiny wave breaks on your tongue and recedes. You see a person at the far end of the room whose silhouette fits the absence you’ve been carrying. They turn, and it’s almost your friend and almost not—eyes you remember, hair dyed the wrong decade. They reach out as if to steady you, and the floor-map sighs, rolling under your feet like a tired tide.

“I’ve been trying to find you,” you say, relieved, and your voice arrives half a second after your mouth moves. Your words appear as moths and smudge themselves against their shoulder before evaporating.

“I’ve been here the whole time,” they say, and the words are a bridge of string that you can feel vibrating inside your chest.

You’re pulled through another knot of people: a cluster gathered around a punch bowl that holds a moon. “Careful,” someone warns, “it’s high tide,” and a man in a tuxedo wets his cufflinks laughing. A child in a cardinal suit tells you your friend is in the other room. “Which room?” you ask, and the child points to a door that is also a portrait of a door that is also your grandmother’s front door. The knob is warm, like a held hand.

As you reach for it, the music hitches and flips backwards. Everyone begins to speak in their sleep. You hear love confessed to a coat rack, travel plans made with a goldfish, the sound of forgiveness turning into a paper plane that glides and lands in your palm. It’s addressed to you, in your friend’s handwriting. Inside: “I’m at the edge.”

The edge is a balcony that returns when needed. You step out into the night and discover the air is shallow; you have to breathe carefully or you’ll swallow a star. Below, the city is an aquarium of lit rooms, each one a small, private ocean. The rail is cool, the jellyfish-chandeliers have drifted out to bob among the constellations, and leaning against the stone is your friend—exactly them now, no almost.

They’re tracing circles on the railing, and every circle becomes a keyhole. “I didn’t want to interrupt,” they say. The wind rearranges your hair into a map, and this time the letters of their name come and stay, obedient and bright as pins.

“I kept losing your name,” you tell them.

“It’s okay,” they say. “I kept changing it.”

You both laugh, and the sound sends a flock of paper cranes up from the garden, unfolding midflight and becoming white shirts that drift back down over the party’s shoulders. For a moment, the music falls into place. You recognize the melody: it’s the one you hummed into a seashell when you were nine and forgot about, the one your friend whistled once under a streetlight that was flickering its own morse code for stay.

“Let’s go,” they say. “I want to show you something.” They take your hand, and your hand becomes a small, obedient animal that has been waiting for this exact leash. You follow them along the balcony’s edge, which curves further than the building should allow. The night opens like a book you’ve already read, with marginalia that looks like your handwriting and also someone else’s.

At the far end, there’s a door with no handle, only a peephole. Your friend knocks once, twice, and the peephole blinks. It looks at you like an old teacher. “Password?” it asks.

Your friend looks at you, and you know it at once: the flavor of childhood chalk, the shape of a last-minute apology, the way the party’s laughter pooled in the dips between songs. You say the password without words. The door inhales, then exhales you inside.

It opens to a room that is all the rooms you’ve loved: a kitchen at two a.m., a porch in rain, a corner of a library where a sunbeam was trapped for an hour. On the table is a small carousel with only two horses. A sign says Please Choose With Your Less Dominant Hand. Your friend grins and picks the horse that looks tired. You pick the one with a half-painted eye. The carousel starts to turn with a sound like wind through reeds; the whole room tilts, and so does your heart, and for a second you understand everything about leaving and arriving.

“Do you remember,” your friend asks, “the party we didn’t go to where we met anyway?” You do. It was this one, and every one. You both watch as the room slows, see the soft reflection of yourselves in the window becoming you and then older and then a pair of paper cutouts held up to a lamp.

“I thought you were lost,” you say.

“I am,” they say, and smile, “but I’m here with you.”

When you step back into the party, it’s a different season. People wear their summer regrets like light scarves. The band is playing a new negative-space song. Someone has finally flipped the map floor right-side-up; the continents stretch and yawn. Your friend squeezes your hand once, a code for stay. Your name and theirs settle together like birds on a wire.

You move through the crowd, no longer looking, only finding: a stranger who tells you the punch tastes like a river you once threw rocks into, a woman who teaches you how to bow to a chandelier, a child asleep under the coat rack crowned with jackets like a small king. The night grows gentle and specific. The party hums you into itself.

At some point, the waiter passes again with a tray of rain. “Last call,” he says, and you both take a sip. This time, the water spells your friend’s name on your tongue and it stays, not walking away, not even when you speak it out loud. It sounds like your name answered back, and the answer is a door opening with no need for a password.

You look at your friend, and their face is your favorite conversation. Somewhere, a pocket watch sighs; somewhere, the map-labeled floor stops trying to escape and curls up to nap. You realize you’ve been found for a while now, and you laugh at how long it took to notice.

Then the music swells, and someone asks you to dance, and the jellyfish dim as if to give the stars a turn, and you and your friend step into the soft, ridiculous gravity of it, and the dream decides to keep going for one more song.
