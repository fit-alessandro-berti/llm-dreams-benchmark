You stand before the blank canvas, a stark, almost painful rectangle of void in a world where *everything* pulses with unstable energy. The sky above swirls from mercury-silver to deep-sea green, dissolving into fractured cubes of amber light. Trees nearby melt into liquid topaz, then reform as jagged obsidian shards singing with harmonic hums. Yet the canvas... it is *still*. Pure, unchanging white. A pocket of silence in the symphony of flux.

As your fingers hover near its edge, the air around it *thickens*. It’s not cold or hot, but *resistant*, like pushing through warm silk. You press a fingertip against the pristine surface.

**It doesn’t smudge. It *absorbs*.**

A single, impossible drop of **midnight indigo** blooms where your skin touched it—not spreading outward, but *drilling inward*, sinking into depths the canvas shouldn't possess. The indigo doesn’t stay still. It *breathes*, swelling into a nebula of swirling stars, then collapsing into the silhouette of a bird with wings of fractured glass. The bird shatters, and the shards become **crimson threads**, weaving themselves into a ladder that spirals *up* from the canvas, vanishing into the shifting sky.

You lean closer. The canvas reflects not your face, but a **field of floating, glowing seeds**—each seed pulsing with a different color. As you watch, one seed **detaches** from the painted field and *floats off the canvas*, hovering in the air before you. It’s warm, humming like a trapped sunbeam. You reach for it.

*Touch.*

The seed **bursts**.

Not in destruction—a **silent detonation of scent**. Jasmine. Wet earth after rain. Ozone. The scents don’t fade; they *solidify* into **new shapes** around you:  
- Vines of **liquid copper** curl around your ankles, cooling into delicate, humming bracelets.  
- A shower of **prismatic dust** settles on your shoulders, forming a cloak that shifts from iridescent scales to shimmering vapor with each breath you take.  
- The ground beneath your feet turns **translucent**, revealing a city of glowing coral far below, its towers chiming like glass wind chimes.

The canvas now shows **your reflection**, but you’re *not* in the dream landscape. You’re standing in a room of perfect white silence—you, holding the blank canvas. In *that* reflection, your eyes blaze with **shifting constellations**.

*Why?* you wonder. *Am I painting the world... or is the canvas painting me?*

You pick up a fallen brush made of frozen starlight (it materialized beside the canvas, glowing softly). As the bristles meet the surface—  

**The world *stops*.**  

Colors freeze mid-shift. Shapes lock in impossible angles. The sky is a mosaic of suspended raindrops, each holding a tiny, silent scene: a child laughing, a clock melting, a door floating in space. Only the canvas moves.  

Your brushstroke draws a single, **vibrant gold line**. It doesn’t stay a line. It *unfurls* into a path of light leading directly back to your childhood home—a house that never existed, yet you *know* it. The path glows, humming with the scent of old paper and honey.  

You take a step toward it. The canvas reflects your movement *in reverse*: you’re walking *away* from the path, back into the frozen chaos.  

A whisper, not in your ears but in your *bones*:  
***"Finish the dream before the canvas finishes you."***  

You look down. Where your foot touched the gold path, the frozen raindrop beneath it begins to fall.  

And the world holds its breath.  

*(What happens when the drop hits the ground? The dream isn’t over—it’s waiting for your next stroke.)*
