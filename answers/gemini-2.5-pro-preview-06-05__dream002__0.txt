...the air grows heavy and thick, smelling of ozone and damp earth. The cheerful birdsong is silenced, replaced by a low, resonant hum that seems to come from the ground itself. The sky, once a gentle blue, curdles into a bruised, violent purple.

Instead of running for cover, I feel an inexplicable pull towards the heart of the approaching chaos. The trees around me begin to change. Their bark shimmers, swirling with patterns like oil on water, and their leaves turn from green to silver, clinking against each other like tiny, delicate chimes in the rising wind. The sound is beautiful and unnerving.

The first drops of rain begin to fall, but they aren't wet. They are tiny, warm beads of light that hover in the air for a moment before sinking into my skin, leaving behind a tingling sensation, like a forgotten memory trying to surface.

The path ahead dissolves, and the forest floor becomes a vast, starless expanse of black, reflective glass. I am walking on the sky. Below my feet, I can see the forest I just left, tiny and distant, as if I'm looking down from a great height.

The storm is here now, but it's not a storm of wind and thunder. It is a storm of whispers. Voices swirl around me, some familiar, some ancient and strange, speaking in a language I don't know but understand perfectly. They tell stories of forgotten kings, of cities made of coral, of the first-ever dream.

In the center of the swirling whispers and hovering lights, a single, colossal oak tree stands. It is ancient, its branches so wide they seem to hold up the purple sky. From one of its boughs hangs a simple, old-fashioned swing.

As I approach, a figure takes shape on the swing, coalescing from the light and the whispers. It is me, but a much younger version of myself, maybe seven or eight years old. The child isn't afraid. They are swinging gently back and forth, bare feet kicking in the air, smiling a secret smile as if this magnificent, impossible storm is a private show, put on just for them.

The child looks at me, and their smile widens. They don't speak, but a single thought lands in my mind, as clear as a bell and as warm as the light-rain on my skin:

*“You took your time getting back.”*

The swing arcs higher and higher. With one final, joyful push, the child lets go, flying upwards into the heart of the purple clouds. They don't fall, but dissolve into a shower of brilliant, golden sparks.

The whispers cease. The purple sky softens to a gentle dawn pink. The glass beneath my feet becomes soft grass once more. I am standing in the peaceful forest again, a single, silver leaf in my hand, and the air is filled with the scent of fresh rain and the feeling of a long-forgotten promise, finally kept.
