In your dream, as you stroll through the tranquil forest, the atmosphere shifts abruptly. The once gentle breeze transforms into powerful gusts, causing the branches above to sway and creak. Dark, ominous clouds gather overhead, obscuring the sunlight. Sensing the impending storm, you survey your surroundings, seeking shelter. A clap of thunder echoes throughout the woods, followed by a brilliant flash of lightning that illuminates your path. As you continue walking, an old, seemingly abandoned cabin emerges from the shadows, offering a potential refuge from the elements. As the rain begins to pour and the wind whips around you, you hasten your steps towards the mysterious cabin, hoping to find safety, shelter, and answers within its walls.
