the trees around you begin to sway violently, their branches creaking like old wooden doors. The once-bright sunlight disappears as dark clouds roll across the sky, casting everything into a strange, silvery twilight. The air grows thick, almost electric, and you can feel the storm’s energy radiating through you.

As the wind picks up, a powerful gust tugs at your clothes, pulling you toward a distant clearing. Despite the ominous atmosphere, something compels you to move forward. The forest trail transforms under your feet, the soft dirt becoming a shimmering path of glass that reflects the stormy sky above. The sound of thunder rumbles deep and low, like a heartbeat, and you notice faint whispers coming from the trees, though you can’t quite make out what they’re saying.

When you finally reach the clearing, the storm seems to pause, as if waiting for you to take in the scene. In the center of the clearing stands an ancient tree unlike any you’ve ever seen before. Its bark glows with faint golden veins of light, and its leaves are a swirling mix of green and silver, as if alive with their own energy. Nestled in the base of the tree is an ornate door, impossibly intricate, with patterns shifting as you look at them.

You feel an overwhelming urge to touch the door, though you hesitate for a moment, questioning whether this is wise. The storm seems to echo your hesitation—lightning flashes across the sky, illuminating the door’s symbols, which appear to move in response. You reach out, and as soon as your fingers graze the surface, the world around you dissolves into blinding light.

When your vision clears, you find yourself in a place that feels both alien and familiar—a vast expanse of stars stretching infinitely in every direction. A figure emerges from the starlight, their presence calm but otherworldly. They speak, their voice resonating in your mind rather than your ears:

"You have crossed into the Threshold of Wonders, dreamer. What do you seek to learn from this place?"

The question lingers in the air. You realize you must answer, but the words won't come easily. What do you say?
