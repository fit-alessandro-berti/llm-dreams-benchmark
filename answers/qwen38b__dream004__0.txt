You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and feel an inexplicable pull toward it. The canvas is enormous, stretching into the horizon like a vast, silent mirror. Its surface is smooth yet textured, as though it were both solid and liquid, reflecting not the world around you but fragments of your own memories—glimpses of childhood laughter, the hush of rain, the ache of a forgotten promise.  

As you step closer, the canvas begins to pulse, its emptiness humming with potential. A single brushstroke materializes in your hand, glowing faintly with the color of dawn. You press it against the canvas, and the blankness erupts into a cascade of imagery: your childhood home, a forest path, a starry sky, all swirling in vibrant, shifting hues. The shapes morph—trees become rivers, skies melt into oceans, and the ground beneath your feet dissolves into a mosaic of constellations.  

Suddenly, the canvas cracks open, revealing a portal—a tunnel of light leading into the unknown. A voice, neither familiar nor foreign, whispers, *“Choose.”* You realize the canvas is not just a surface but a gateway to possibilities, each stroke a path to a different version of yourself. One path shows a life of adventure, another of quiet fulfillment, and a third… a void, dark and endless.  

You hesitate, the brush trembling in your hand. The world around you flickers, colors bleeding into one another, as if the universe itself is waiting for your decision. Will you step into the light, or let the canvas return to its blank silence? The answer, you sense, lies not in the choice itself, but in the question—*what do you truly wish to create?*  

And in that moment, the dream dissolves, leaving you suspended between creation and oblivion.
