…take a deep breath and walk away for a moment. The air around you feels thick, as if you’re trying to move through water. You can hear echoes of your friend’s voice, but the words are muffled, looping back on themselves. You turn a corner and suddenly you’re no longer in the place where the argument started — now you’re in a vast, dimly lit library. The shelves stretch upward into shadow, filled not with books but with glass jars, each containing a flickering light.

Somehow, you know each jar is a memory — yours, your friend’s, and many others — swirling gently inside like fireflies in slow motion. You feel drawn to one jar in particular. Your hand hovers over it, and the light within pulses warmly, almost like it’s breathing in sync with your heart.

When you pick it up, the library falls silent. A whisper — maybe yours, maybe your friend’s — ripples from inside the jar: *“We’ve been here before.”*  

You turn to see your friend standing at the other end of the aisle, holding a jar that glows the same color. You know that if you open both jars at the same time, you might remember what the disagreement was really about… or you might lose the feeling entirely.  

Do you want me to continue the dream from here toward a resolution, or keep it surreal and ambiguous?
