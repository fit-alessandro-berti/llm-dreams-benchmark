...feel a cold dread wash over me. The fluorescent lights of the office seem to buzz louder, amplifying the frantic rhythm of my own heartbeat. My boss, Mr. Henderson, is standing over me, his face a perfect mask of impatient expectation. He taps his pen against the edge of my desk, a steady, relentless drumbeat against the rising panic in my chest.

He's handed me a thick stack of documents, a project proposal titled "Project Phoenix: Reimagining the Future of Everything." The sheer size of it is overwhelming. Scanning the cover page, I see the deadline: **Tomorrow.**

Tomorrow?! It's physically impossible. Even *reading* the proposal, let alone executing it, would take weeks, maybe months. My mind races, desperately searching for an escape, a loophole, any kind of rational explanation that could save me. 

I open my mouth to protest, to stammer out a reason why this is completely unfeasible, but the words catch in my throat. Instead, a strange, involuntary chuckle escapes me. It's a nervous, high-pitched sound that I can't seem to control.

Mr. Henderson raises a skeptical eyebrow. "Something amusing, [My Name]?" he asks, his voice tight.

I shake my head, trying to regain my composure. "No, sir. It's just... the deadline. It's..." I trail off, feeling utterly trapped.

As I look down at the documents, the text begins to blur, the words shifting and rearranging themselves. They morph into indecipherable symbols, a language I don't understand, yet somehow, deep down, I feel I should. 

Suddenly, the office around me begins to change. The familiar beige walls seem to melt and shimmer, replaced by a swirling vortex of colors. The hum of the fluorescent lights becomes a deafening roar. The people around me – my colleagues, who moments ago were diligently working at their computers – transform into bizarre, grotesque caricatures of themselves. Their faces are elongated, their features distorted, their voices a cacophony of whispers and cackles.

Mr. Henderson, his expression still fixed, his pen still tapping, suddenly grows to twice his size. He looms over me, his shadow engulfing my desk, his pen now the size of a baseball bat. He smiles, a wide, unsettling grin that reveals rows of needle-sharp teeth.

He leans down close to my ear, his voice a booming whisper. "Time is running out, [My Name]. The future... depends on you."

And then, the pen falls.
