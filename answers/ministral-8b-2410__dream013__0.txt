find yourself standing before a massive, grand door. It's adorned with intricate carvings that seem to dance in the dim light, depicting scenes from ancient myths and legends. You notice a small, glowing keyhole just above the door's intricate locking mechanism. You reach into your pocket and pull out an odd, yet familiar-looking key.

As you approach the door, you hear a faint, echoing voice from the other side. "To enter, you must solve the final puzzle. Look around carefully, for the key to the lock is hidden within the maze." You look around and see several hidden symbols etched into the walls and floor. You quickly realize that these symbols correspond to the puzzles you've solved earlier in the maze.

You take a moment to recall the patterns and sequences from each puzzle. Then, you start to arrange the symbols on the floor in the correct sequence, using your key to activate hidden mechanisms that bring the symbols to life. As you complete the arrangement, the symbols begin to glow brighter and brighter until they form a complex, shimmering pattern that revolves around you.

Just as you finish, the door creaks open slowly, revealing a vast, illuminated chamber filled with floating books and scrolls. The chamber seems to be made of glass, and you can see the entire cityscape outside, bathed in the soft glow of the setting sun. The voice echoes through the chamber, "Welcome, seeker of knowledge. You have unlocked the final door. Here, you will find answers to questions you never knew you had."
