speak, but suddenly, you realize you’ve forgotten everything you were supposed to say. Your mind goes blank, and a wave of panic washes over you. The audience is still waiting, their eyes fixed on you. You feel your heart race, and the room seems to grow colder. 

Then, just as you're about to stumble over your words, you notice something strange. The podium in front of you has turned into a giant book, its pages flipping rapidly as if searching for the right words. Intrigued, you lean in, but instead of text, you see vivid images—pictures of people, places, and ideas you've never seen before, yet they all feel strangely familiar. 

A soft voice inside your mind whispers, "Trust yourself. The words are within you."

Taking a deep breath, you begin to speak from your heart. The words flow smoothly, and the audience seems captivated, hanging on every word. You no longer feel the pressure, but a sense of connection and flow with the crowd. The speech becomes something more than just words; it feels like a shared experience. 

As the final words leave your lips, the crowd erupts in applause, and you step back, realizing that you had been guided by something beyond your conscious mind—something that had always been there, waiting for you to trust it.
