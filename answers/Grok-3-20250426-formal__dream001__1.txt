navigate the bustling streets, your heart racing with urgency. The city is a labyrinth of towering glass buildings and winding alleys, filled with people moving purposefully, their faces blurred as if in a watercolor painting. You clutch a crumpled note in your pocket, the only clue to your destination, but when you unfold it, the ink has smudged into illegible streaks. Panic creeps in, yet something compels you to keep moving forward.

You approach a street vendor, whose cart emits a warm, golden glow, unlike the cold neon lights around you. The vendor, an elderly figure with kind, knowing eyes, hands you a small, ornate compass without a word. Its needle spins wildly before settling on a direction. Trusting it, you weave through the crowd, the compass guiding you past vibrant markets and quiet courtyards hidden between skyscrapers. The city seems to shift around you, streets bending and reforming as if alive, yet the compass remains steady.

As minutes tick by, you arrive at a grand, ivy-covered building that feels oddly familiar, though you’re certain you’ve never seen it before. The doors open automatically, and you step into a vast atrium where a single figure waits—a silhouette against a stained-glass window. They turn, and their face is yours, but older, calmer, as if they’ve been expecting you. “You’re right on time,” they say, their voice echoing softly. The meeting, you realize, isn’t about business—it’s about understanding something deeper, something you’ve been chasing all along.

The dream shifts, and you feel a question lingering in the air, though no one speaks it. The compass in your hand grows warm, and the city beyond the window begins to dissolve into light. You wake with the sensation of holding something precious, though you can’t quite name it, the dream’s meaning hovering just out of reach.
