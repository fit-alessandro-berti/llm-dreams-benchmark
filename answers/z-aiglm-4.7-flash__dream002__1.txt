You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air turns thick with the smell of ozone and ancient earth. The sky, which had been a clear azure, instantly turns the color of a bruised plum and churns into a dark, swirling vortex. 

Lightning strikes—not against the trees, but *from* them. As the thunder rumbles, you watch in disbelief as the tall pines begin to shed their bark like dry skin, revealing branches made of swirling mist and clockwork gears. The rain begins to fall, but instead of water, it’s a warm, glowing mist that makes the back of your neck tingle. 

You stop to catch your breath, and as you look down at your hands, the skin there seems to dissolve into dust, and you realize with a sudden jolt that you are no longer made of flesh and bone, but of moonlight and shadow. The forest ahead opens up into a vast, silent ocean where the "trees" are actually massive islands floating on a sea of clouds. You take a step forward, and for the first time, your feet leave the ground completely.
