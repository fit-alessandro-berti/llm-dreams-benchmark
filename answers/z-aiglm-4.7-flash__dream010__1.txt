...and the obstacles shift from mere hurdles into distortions of your own mind. 

First, the contestants are led into a hall of mirrors, but these aren't reflections—they are alternate versions of you, each one carrying a different secret fear. Your task is to solve a puzzle using a key, but the puzzle is a live pigeon, and the key is a lock that dissolves when you breathe on it too hard. 

Just as you’re about to give up, the judges, who have been silent wooden figures this whole time, suddenly come to life, their mouths moving but not making a sound. You look at the prize—your dream job title—and see that it is simply a blinking light at the end of a tunnel that keeps getting shorter. You reach for it, but your arm feels heavy, as if made of lead, and you feel yourself floating up toward the ceiling, watching the whole competition happen in slow motion from above.
