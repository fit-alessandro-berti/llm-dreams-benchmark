You wake in a dim, unfamiliar room. The air smells of woodsmoke, damp earth, and something faintly herbal. Sunlight streams through a small, leaded glass window, illuminating motes dancing in the air. Your modern clothes feel alien against rough linen sheets. Panic flutters, then subsides as you remember: *This is just a dream.*

You rise, your bare feet cold on the packed earth floor. The door creaks open onto a narrow cobblestone street. Horses clip-clop past, pulling carts laden with barrels and crates. People wear muted woolens and linens, faces weathered by a life without electricity or plastics. A church bell tolls the hour – deep, resonant, and utterly real.

As you explore, the sheer *difference* hits you. No cars, no distant hum of machinery, no phones. The loudest sounds are human and animal voices, the clatter of hooves, the creak of wood. You realize, with a growing sense of urgency, that **you need to find water.** Your throat is parched, your mouth dry. The stream running alongside the street looks inviting, but also... suspect. Do you:

1.  **Approach a local apothecary shop** (marked by a painted sign of a mortar and pestle) and try to gesture your need for water, hoping they understand? (Risking social awkwardness or suspicion)
2.  **Follow the stream downstream**, hoping it leads to a well or a public fountain where people draw water? (Risking getting lost in unfamiliar streets)
3.  **Watch what the townspeople do.** Find a market stall selling jugs or barrels and try to mime purchasing one, then find a water source to fill it? (Requires observation and mimicry)

**The dream continues...**

**(If you chose 1: Approach the Apothecary)**

You push open the heavy oak door of the apothecary. Shelves line the walls, crammed with jars of dried herbs, colorful liquids in glass phials, and strange animal parts. An older man with spectacles perched low on his nose looks up, startled. He speaks in a guttural dialect you don't understand. You point to your mouth, then mime drinking. He frowns, then his eyes widen slightly. He rummages behind the counter, pulling out a small, chipped ceramic cup. He gestures towards a barrel in the corner. You nod gratefully. He dips the cup, fills it, and hands it to you. The water is cool and sweet. As you drink, you notice a curious, leather-bound book on a side table, its pages yellowed. The apothecary watches you intently, his expression unreadable.

**(If you chose 2: Follow the Stream)**

You walk alongside the clear(ish) stream, past washerwomen beating laundry clean on stones, past children skipping pebbles. The flow takes you past crowded tenements and into a slightly quieter district. You round a bend and see it: a large, stone public fountain, water gushing from a carved lion's mouth into a deep basin. People are filling buckets, jugs, and even large barrels. Relief washes over you. You approach, realizing you have nothing to carry water in. You watch as a woman fills a wooden bucket. You gesture towards her bucket, then towards yourself, miming a request. She looks surprised but holds it out. You drink deeply, the cool water soothing. As you hand the bucket back, you notice a commotion further down the street – a small, angry crowd has gathered around a man in slightly finer clothes who seems to be arguing with a guard. Your dream-self feels a pull towards the drama, but also a growing sense of *being out of place*.

**(If you chose 3: Watch and Mimic)**

You find a busy market square. Stalls sell bread, cheese, live chickens, bolts of cloth, and simple pottery. You spot a stall selling clay jugs and barrels. You watch a customer point, pay a few coins, and leave with a small jug. You approach the stallkeeper, a plump woman with flour on her apron. You point to a jug, mimic counting coins, and hold out your hand expectantly. She looks confused but holds up a jug. You nod vigorously. She shrugs, takes a few dull coins you offer (where did they come from?), and hands you the jug. Triumph! Now, where to find water? You follow the flow of people towards the stream you passed earlier, spotting a spot where people are filling containers. You fill your jug, the water sloshing over the rim. As you lift it, feeling its satisfying weight, you notice a group of children pointing at your strange modern sneakers peeking out from under your trousers. They giggle. Their laughter echoes strangely in the quiet air.

**The dream deepens...**

Whatever choice you made, the immediate thirst is slaked. But the unfamiliar world presses in. The rough fabric of your borrowed tunic (you must have found it?) scratches your skin. The smells – woodsmoke, dung, sweat, baking bread – are overwhelming. You realize, with a deeper pang, that **you need to understand where you are and how to survive.** Do you:

A.  **Seek out someone who looks educated or official** (maybe a scribe, a monk, or a town official) and try, through gestures and broken words, to find out the year and location? (Risk of being taken for a madman or a vagrant)
B.  **Find a busy tavern or inn** and observe, listening to conversations, trying to piece together the era and place from snippets of conversation? (Risk of eavesdropping being obvious or encountering hostility)
C.  **Look for clues in your own belongings.** Do you still have your wallet? Phone? Keys? Anything that might hint at your origin, or perhaps... a way back? (Risk of finding nothing, or something deeply unsettling)

The dream is yours to navigate. What does your dream-self do next?
