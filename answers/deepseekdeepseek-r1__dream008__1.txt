Ah, the dream plunges forward, relentless and surreal. Your boss’s face elongates like melting wax, their voice a distorted echo: *“The deadline is now. NOW.”* You glance at the project brief, but the words scramble into ancient runes. Your keyboard sprouts vines; each keystroke blooms flowers that wilt instantly, petals turning to ash. Panic tightens your chest as the walls inch closer, plaster cracking to reveal gears grinding beneath, ticking in time with your pulse.  

A coworker materializes, but their mouth is stitched shut. They hand you a USB drive labeled “Lucid Solution.” You plug it in, and the screen floods with a vortex, sucking the entire project into a pixelated whirlwind. The boss howls, morphing into a grandfather clock, hands spinning backward. Time unravels—suddenly, you’re holding a completed report, written in a language that doesn’t exist. The office dissolves into a chalkboard, and you wake just as the chalk in your hand crumbles to dust.  

The dream lingers, a puzzle of symbols your morning coffee can’t decipher.
