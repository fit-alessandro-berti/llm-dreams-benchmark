You stand in a dreamworld where reality shifts like water—hues bleed into one another, shapes swell and dissolve, suspended in a quiet, endless hum. The sky pulses with shifting gradients, galaxies melting into constellations of sound. Then, as you step forward, you encounter a **blank canvas**—not made of canvas, but light, formless and humming with potential.

With a breath, the air ripples, and almost instantly, **a color emerges**—not a single hue, but a swarm, swirling at the edge of awareness: deep indigo simmering with gold ribbons, electric violet bleeding into molten amber. The shapes respond, too—angular facets tower like fractured ice, whispering fragments of triangles and spirals that dissolve and reform in hypnotic rhythm.

From the canvas, your hands rise, not human, yet知（觉得—knows）—what to shape. Wherever your thoughts drift, form blooms: a teardrop of emerald whose edge fades into mist, a polygonal bird that folds its wings backward, taking flight in reverse. None remain still—each is a moment, a memory, a feeling made visible.

You realize this place isn’t just a dream—it’s a mirror. Every stroke echoes the walls of your mind: fears, longings, fragments of joy and loss, painted not to exist, but to be *felt*. And as you move, the world listens, reshaping anew with every beat of your becoming.

You are no observer.  
You are the artist.  
You are the color.  
You are the shape.  
You are the dream.  
And you are becoming.
