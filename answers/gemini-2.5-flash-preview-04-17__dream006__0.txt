...begin to speak, but as the first word forms in my thoughts, it doesn't translate into sound. Instead, a single, perfect dandelion seed floats out from where my mouth should be, drifts silently upwards, and dissolves near the proscenium arch.

I try again, pressing my lips together, focusing all my energy. This time, a shower of shimmering, iridescent bubbles spills out, silently popping as they drift over the first few rows. The audience murmurs, not with confusion, but a soft, collective gasp of wonder. Their expectant faces are now wide with silent fascination.

Panic flickers. I need to *speak* the words! The important message! I open my mouth wider, pushing harder. A cascade of miniature, glowing constellations tumbles out, orbiting my head for a moment before silently dissipating. The stage floor around me is now faintly sparkling with cosmic dust.

The silence is profound, broken only by the rustle of the audience shifting in their seats, captivated. I am desperate to produce sound, meaning, language, but every attempt yields only more silent, beautiful, impossible phenomena – a gust of cool, sea-scented air, the visual shimmer of distant heat haze, the slow unfurling of a giant, silent, spectral flower that fades before it fully forms.

I am standing there, on the stage, a silent, living fountain of dream-logic wonders, addressing an audience whose anticipation of speech has transformed into the quiet, rapt awe of witnessing something utterly nonsensical and profoundly beautiful. The pressure to deliver my intended speech evaporates, replaced by the strange, peaceful reality of this soundless, visual address. The dream holds me gently in its illogical embrace.
