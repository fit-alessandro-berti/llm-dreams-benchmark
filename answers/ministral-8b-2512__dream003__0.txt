Ah, the box hums faintly beneath your fingertips—a low, resonant vibration like a heartbeat, or perhaps the whisper of a language long forgotten. The patterns on its surface are alive in a way that defies logic: they shift subtly when you blink, rearranging themselves into constellations of light that seem to *breathe* with the rhythm of your own breath. Some resemble:

- **A spiral staircase** that ascends into nothingness, its steps made of what looks like liquid silver.
- **A keyhole shaped like a crescent moon**, but when you press your palm against it, the edges soften into a smile—yours, or someone else’s?
- **A map of veins** pulsing with ink, as if the box itself is a living thing, its circulatory system exposed.
- **A child’s drawing** of a door, but the door is *you*—your face distorted into a grinning portal, eyes wide with something between wonder and terror.

Then, the box *speaks*—not with sound, but with *images* that press against your mind like wet fingers:
- A memory you don’t recognize: a garden at dusk, a figure tending to something buried in the earth. The figure turns—it’s *you*, but older, your hands cradling a seed that glows.
- A warning: *"The lock is not for keys, but for *questions*."* The words dissolve into smoke, leaving only the scent of rain and old paper.
- A choice: press your ear to the box, or open your palm to let it press *into* you.

You hesitate. The air grows thick, charged with the weight of something *waiting*—not inside the box, but *behind* it, like a shadow that knows your name.

What do you do?

*(Or, if you’d like, I can weave another thread—perhaps the box begins to *sing*, or the patterns start bleeding onto your skin…)*
