You stumble, cold sweat slicking your brow, as the forest canopy opens up as if by magic. The sky erupts in a tempest of lightning and rain—bursts of silver flashes illuminate the trees, and the air crackles with energy. The ground beneath your feet becomes muddy and slippery, and branches snap above you like warnings from the heavens.

Then, from the chaos, a figure appears. She’s cloaked in silver, her face partially hidden beyond a veil of light, but her eyes—golden, fierce, and knowing—fix on yours. The wind dies down, and the rain begins to stop. Instead, it pauses mid-drop, glittering like falling stars, and falls only as soft, glowing petals of light.

The creature reaches into the air and begins to pluck them, one by one, shaping them into intricate symbols in the air. They hum with ancient power, weaving a protective bubble around you. The storm halts completely. The forest stills. Every leaf, every blade of grass, seems to listen to the vow unspoken in this moments: *This place must be safe.*

Then, the world begins to *rebuild* itself—branches lift like repressed energy, moss swells in the cracks of the ground, and flowers of impossible colors bloom in seconds. You feel the rebirth, not just of nature, but of something deeper—an awakening, a memory, a dream—not your own, but ancient.

You stand there, trembling with magic and mystery, as the last light of the storm dissolves into a sky painted with constellations you’ve never seen before. And you know... you’re not in a dream anymore.
