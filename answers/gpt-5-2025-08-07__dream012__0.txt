…and you set your jaw around the taste of salt and copper while your hands find the wheel as if they were born there. The wood is slick and warm, a living thing thrumming with the ache of the ship’s spine. The deck rears, gullies of water racing the length of the scuppers, and the sky is a torn sail stitched together by lightning.

“Reef the main!” you call, and even though the wind steals most words, this one goes out like a thrown rope and finds every ear. “Drop the tops’l! Lash what isn’t nailed and nail what isn’t lashed. Storm jib only. Heave-to on my call.”

Faces whip toward you—eyes reflecting electricity and fear—and in each of them you see someone you know in a way that confuses and calms you. The old boatswain is your grandfather, or the idea of him; the young girl at the bowline is a version of you with scabby knees, your favorite blue shirt from when you were eight. The cook has your hands, older and speckled like a map. Everyone moves with the smooth muscle memory of a song you’ve all always known.

You keep one eye on the compass, which spins and stutters, then points past north to a place not on the card at all, a place that hovers somewhere behind your sternum. You lay a palm against it without meaning to. The needle steadies.

“On the next surge,” you shout. “Hard a-lee. Breath with me.”

It is absurd to say, but your crew understands, and the ship does too, rigging humming like a tuning fork. You draw a breath and so does the canvas; you let it go and the storm lets one go, too. The rain eases just enough for an instant and you see it coming: a wall of water shouldering its way through the crowded room of waves, a blue muscle heaving itself higher and higher until it’s a moving mountain cutting off the world. The thunder waits for it, holding its own breath.

“Now!” you say, and spin the wheel, and the rudder bites and the keel shudders with the effort of holding steady into the thing that is trying to erase you. The deck tips toward the sky. Somewhere below, mugs clatter and a pot lid goes flat with a clang; somewhere above, a knot remembers it exists and tightens itself.

For a ridiculous, certain second you believe you can step off and walk up the face of the wave, and you do, and it’s possible. Your boots find purchase on a ladder made of rain. The world is glass and roar. You are the height of the mast and you are the smallest nail in the smallest plank, and you are the captain in the middle of it all, and the helm is warm in your hands and has a pulse.

“Eyes on me,” you call down, though you’re looking into a green cathedral of water. Inside it are things that don’t belong to the sea: a wooden chair, a foxed photograph, a child’s kite. A calendar page sticks to the underside of the wave and flaps once. You think you see your window at home and the curtain you never fixed, the corner that curls, that admits a square of morning.

You come down the face fast, the prow planting, the shock ripping through the planks and up into your bones. The ship takes it, her timbers answering back in a language you understand in your ribs. Foam collapses into the scuppers and you hear your name in the noise, not the one anyone calls you but the one the sea has for you when it wants you to pay attention.

“Back the jib,” you say calmly, because calm is contagious, because you decide it is. “Trim to three points. Lash the helm. Heave-to.”

Lines fly and are caught. The storm, angry at being denied forward motion, sulks into a different stance, shoving but not sweeping. The ship leans into it like a shoulder accepts the weight of a basket, and then there is a new rhythm to the chaos, less screech and more refrain.

The old boatswain—your not-a-grandfather—begins a tune with no words, and the crew joins, voices finding each other in the wind. It isn’t that you beat the weather with song; it’s more that the song reminds everything where the edges are. The mast vibrates sympathetically and the rigging sets to a note that seems to pare down the storm until it fits, until it is only as large as itself and no larger.

You stand with the wheel held by its leather lashing and put your palm flat against it anyway, not because it needs you, but because you need to feel the ship feel you. Around you, the world is a blur of white and black and salt and light, but the eye is coming—you can smell it. The air changes from iron to water, metallic to green, and a thick quiet draws across the sea like someone pulling a curtain.

And then the curtain is open on a new sound: the soft hiss of a rain that doesn’t bite. The wind unknots. A ring of high walls of weather walks itself around you, and inside the ring is a room. The stars are still hiding, but the clouds in the eye are lit from nowhere, from the color of the hour that is neither before dawn nor after dusk.

The crew are looking at you as if you did a magic trick, as if you found a door in a wall that had never been a wall at all. You can see every face without squinting. You can see every drop of water beading on every lash.

“Soup,” you tell the cook—whose hands are your hands, older, steadier—and the smell of thyme rises as if it was waiting beneath the deck the whole time. The young you, the girl with the bowline, comes to stand beside you and you show her the knot again anyway, because teaching a knot is how you tether things you cannot hold.

A gull lands on the boom with idiot certainty, unbothered as gods, and tucks one foot up into its belly, a small perfect act of trust. You laugh, and the laugh is passed around the ship like a cup.

You look to the compass again and find it pointed plainly, soberly north, and it doesn’t matter that there is no mark there on the card that says the name of any place you have ever been. The mark is the pressure beneath your palm, the steady breathing of the ship matching yours, the way the storm stands at the edge of this circle and knows, for now, to wait.

“Stand easy,” you say, and your voice comes back to you from the mast, from the deck, from the mouths of the crew, and from the water itself, which has been listening. You lean your cheek against the wheel and the varnish smells like sun even here, even now.

You close your eyes in the eye of the storm, and the ship rests in your hands like a sleeping animal, like a bird that weighs almost nothing. You let the song in your throat ride the last of the wind out of you, and the sea answers, and the first small stitch of stars pricks open above, as if someone somewhere decided you had earned a map.
