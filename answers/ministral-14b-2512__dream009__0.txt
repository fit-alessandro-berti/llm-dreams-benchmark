**Dream Continuation:**

You wake up in a world bathed in golden sunlight, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and wild herbs. The sky is a vast, unbroken blue, dotted with birds you don’t recognize—some with iridescent feathers, others with cries that sound like distant music. You’re lying on a bed of ferns in a dense forest, the kind that stretches endlessly in every direction. No roads, no buildings, no hum of engines—just the whisper of leaves and the distant rush of a river.

You sit up, rubbing your temples. Your clothes are strange—rough-spun linen, a leather belt, boots that feel too heavy. A dagger hangs at your side, its hilt worn smooth by time. *Where am I?* The question echoes in your mind, but the world around you offers no answers, only possibilities.

### **The First Steps:**
You stand, testing your balance. The forest is alive—ants march in disciplined lines, a squirrel chitters from a branch, and in the distance, the faint sound of voices. Not modern speech, but something older, melodic, laced with consonants you’ve never heard before. You follow the sound, moving deeper into the trees.

After what feels like hours, you emerge into a clearing. There, a village of woven huts and thatched roofs nestles around a central fire pit. People—men, women, children—move with purpose, their skin weathered by sun and wind. Some wear furs, others simple tunics dyed in earthy tones. A few glance at you with curiosity, but none approach. One woman, her dark eyes sharp, studies you from a distance before turning back to her work.

### **The Realization:**
You don’t belong here. Not just because of the era, but because of something deeper. Your hands tremble when you try to light a fire with flint and steel (a skill you *think* you know, but the tools feel wrong). Your stomach growls, but the food here—roots, grilled fish, dark bread—tastes unfamiliar, almost bitter. You try to speak, but the words come out garbled, like a child stumbling over a foreign tongue.

Then you see *them*—the marks. Strange symbols carved into the bark of a nearby tree, or painted on the doorposts of the huts. Some resemble runes, others look like warnings. One, in particular, makes your breath catch: a spiral, like the one you once doodled in the margins of a notebook, but here it’s etched into stone with reverence.

### **The Choice:**
You could try to blend in. Learn their ways, their language, their survival skills. But how long would that take? And what if they see you as a threat? Or worse—what if they *know* you don’t belong?

Or you could run. Head toward the river, follow it downstream, see where it leads. Maybe there’s another village, or a city, or—if you’re lucky—a way back.

But as you hesitate, the woman from earlier steps forward, holding out a bowl of steaming broth. She doesn’t speak, but her eyes are kind. She points toward the forest, then gestures at the sky, as if to say: *The world is big. You are not alone.*

### **The Question Lingers:**
Do you stay? Do you fight? Do you accept that this is your new reality?

And then—just as you’re about to make a decision—the ground trembles. A low, guttural roar echoes from the mountains. The villagers freeze. The woman’s face pales.

Something is coming.

**What do you do next?**
- **Try to understand the villagers** (risk trust, but gain allies).
- **Flee into the wilderness** (survival alone, but freedom).
- **Investigate the symbols** (seek answers, but risk drawing attention).
- **Something else?** (The dream is yours to shape.)
