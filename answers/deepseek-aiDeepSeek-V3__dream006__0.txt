...to feel a strange mixture of excitement and calm. The microphone in your hand feels lighter than air, and the spotlight bathes you in a warm, golden glow. You take a deep breath, and as you do, the room falls into a profound silence. You open your mouth to speak, but instead of your own voice, a chorus of whispers fills the air—voices of people from your past, present, and future, all speaking in unison.  

You glance down at your notes, but the pages are blank. Panic briefly flickers in your chest, but then you realize: you don’t need notes. The words come to you effortlessly, flowing like a river. You begin to speak, and your voice resonates with a power you’ve never felt before. Each word feels like a gift to the audience, and you watch as their faces light up with understanding, inspiration, and awe.  

As you continue, the stage beneath your feet begins to shift. The ground becomes a mosaic of colors and shapes, swirling and transforming with every sentence. The audience dissolves into a sea of stars, and you realize you’re not just speaking to them—you’re speaking to the universe itself.  

When you finally finish, there’s a moment of pure silence. Then, the stars burst into applause, their light pulsing in rhythm. You feel a profound sense of connection, as if you’ve tapped into something greater than yourself. As you step back, the stage fades, and you wake up, the echoes of your dream-speech still lingering in your mind.
