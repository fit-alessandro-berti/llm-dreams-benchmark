…sit down at your desk, frantically opening files, only to realize that every document is written in a language you’ve never seen before. Your boss doesn’t seem concerned—just keeps glancing at the clock, which is ticking louder and louder until it feels like it’s echoing in your chest. 

You try to type, but the keyboard keeps morphing under your fingers—first into piano keys, then into smooth river stones that clatter to the floor. You look around for help, but your coworkers are all wearing masks shaped like clocks, their hands spinning wildly.

Panic starts rising in your throat, but when you stand up to leave, your chair pulls you back down, its armrests curling around you like vines. Suddenly, your computer screen flickers, and instead of work files, it now shows a live video of a long corridor lined with doors. You hear a voice—not your boss, not anyone you know—whisper:  

*"You don’t finish the project here. You finish it… in there."*

The corridor on the screen begins to stretch endlessly, and you feel yourself being pulled toward it, gravity tugging you from the inside out.  

Do you want me to **continue the dream down a surreal path** or **turn it into an unsettling nightmare**?
