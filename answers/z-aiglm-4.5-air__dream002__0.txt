You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air instantly thickens, heavy with the scent of ozone and damp earth. The gentle breeze whips into a sudden, sharp gust that tugs at your clothes and sends a shiver down your spine. The cheerful birdsong cuts off abruptly, replaced by an eerie, unnatural silence.

Looking up, you see the sky isn't just darkening; it's *churning*. Vast, bruised-purple clouds roil and collide, illuminated not by sunlight, but by a sickly, internal greenish light that casts long, distorted shadows. The temperature plummets, making you hug yourself for warmth. Then, it begins.

The wind isn't just blowing; it's *moaning*. It whistles through the ancient trees with a sound like a thousand whispers, bending branches so low they scrape the forest floor. The first drops of rain aren't gentle; they're thick, cold, and fall like icy pebbles, pocking the mossy ground. Within seconds, it becomes a torrent. Rain hammers down, so dense it blurs the world into a gray veil, the roar of it filling your ears until you can hear nothing else.

Lightning doesn't just flash; it *cracks* across the sky in jagged, unnatural veins of white and violet, illuminating the forest for split seconds that feel like an eternity. Each strike is followed by a deafening clap of thunder that seems to shake the very ground beneath your boots. The trees, usually so serene, groan and creak as if in pain, their leaves thrashing wildly.

You instinctively seek shelter, diving under the dense canopy of a massive, gnarled oak. But even here, the storm finds you. The wind whips rain sideways, soaking you instantly. As you press your back against the rough bark, watching the chaos unfold, you notice something strange. The moss beneath the oak's roots isn't just wet; it's *glowing* with a faint, phosphorescent blue light, pulsing faintly with each thunderclap. The storm seems alive, ancient, and utterly indifferent to your presence. You stand frozen, heart pounding, a tiny human speck in the heart of a forest that has become a wild, elemental beast, the storm's fury echoing not just in the sky, but in the very trembling earth beneath your feet. What secrets does this violent tempest hold?
