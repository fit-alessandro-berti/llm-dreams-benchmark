You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and strange symbols etched into its surface—some that shimmer faintly, as if catching light from somewhere beyond this world. The box feels warm in your hands, pulsing almost like a heartbeat.

As you trace the patterns with your fingertips, they begin to glow softly, responding to your touch. The symbols seem to tell a story you almost understand—a language of dreams and memories. You realize the box isn't locked the way ordinary things are locked. It waits for something specific: a secret, a truth, a question you've been afraid to ask.

The dream shifts around you. Suddenly, you understand that the box has been waiting for you to find it, not the other way around. Its lock isn't mechanical—it's bound to something within yourself that you haven't yet discovered.

What do you do? Do you try to speak the answer aloud, or search for the hidden mechanism? Perhaps you notice something else about the box—a small compartment, an inscription, or a reflection in its surface that shows you something unexpected?

The dream continues, and you hold the power to shape what happens next...
