and the landscape shifts beneath your feet. One moment you are in a sterile conference room, answering questions written in smoke on a whiteboard; the next, you are wading through a library where the books are made of water and the words dissolve if you hold them too tightly.

The other competitors are faceless silhouettes in sharp suits. They move with impossible speed, handing in portfolios bound in starlight. You try to run, but your legs feel heavy, as if you are moving through deep honey. You realize you are wearing your pajamas, but somehow, everyone else seems to think it's formal wear.

The final challenge is announced by a voice that sounds like your own, echoing from a loudspeaker hidden in the clouds. You must build a bridge to the finish line using only your memories. You reach into your pockets and pull out moments: a childhood summer, the smell of old rain, the feeling of finishing a great book. As you lay them down, they solidify into glass and gold.

You reach the end first. The Judge sits behind a desk that floats in a void of deep indigo. They slide a contract across the surface. It's your dream job, exactly as you imagined it. But as you look at the fine print, the text begins to crawl like ants. The job title isn't "Manager" or "Director." It reads: *Keeper of the Waking World.*

You pick up the pen, but it turns into a feather. The Judge smiles, and their face is suddenly yours, older and tired. "To take the job," they say, "you have to wake up."

The room begins to shake. A loud, rhythmic beeping starts to drown out the silence of the void. The indigo fades to gray. The contract dissolves into sunlight. You reach for the pen one last time, but your hand hits a snooze button instead.

You open your eyes. The dream job is waiting, but only if you get out of bed.
