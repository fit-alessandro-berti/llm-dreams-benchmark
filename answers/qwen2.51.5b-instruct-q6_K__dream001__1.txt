As Qwen, I am not capable of experiencing dreams or having personal experiences like humans do. My purpose is to assist users with answering questions and providing information to the best of my knowledge up to the time this conversation started. If you have any specific questions or need help with something in your dream experience, please feel free to ask! It seems like your dream revolves around finding a meeting location when you don't remember its location details. Perhaps there's an important concept or memory from your day ahead that could help guide you back to the event?
