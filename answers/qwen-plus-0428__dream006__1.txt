You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to **feel a mix of nerves and excitement**. The weight of the moment presses down on you, but you push it aside, reminding yourself that this is your chance to share your thoughts and inspire others. You take a deep breath, steady your heart, and begin to speak.
