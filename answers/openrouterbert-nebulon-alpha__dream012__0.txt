**The Storm’s Heart**

The wind howls like a wounded beast, tearing at the sails as if the very sky seeks to devour your ship. The *Iron Mermaid* groans beneath you, her timbers straining against the fury of the sea. Waves rise like black mountains, their crests frothing with foam, and the lightning splits the heavens in two—each strike illuminating the terror in your crew’s eyes.

You grip the wheel, knuckles white, salt stinging your face. The compass spins wildly, its needle lost to the chaos. The first mate, a grizzled woman with a scar across her cheek, shouts over the storm: *"Captain! The mainsail’s torn! We’re losing her!"*

You bark orders—*"Reef the sails! Secure the cargo! Man the pumps!"*—but the sea mocks your commands. A monstrous wave crashes over the deck, sweeping two sailors overboard before they can even scream. The ship lurches, tilting dangerously, and for a heartbeat, you think she’ll capsize.

Then—*a sound*.

Not the storm. Not the creaking of wood. Something deeper. A *pulse*, like the heartbeat of the ocean itself. The water around the *Iron Mermaid* begins to glow, an eerie blue light seeping from the depths. The crew freezes, their fear turning to awe as the waves still, the wind dying to a whisper.

A shape emerges from the water.

At first, you think it’s a whale—a leviathan, ancient and vast. But as it rises, you see it’s no beast. It’s a *city*. Towers of coral and bone, bridges of pearl and driftwood, streets paved with shells that shimmer like stars. The city floats upon the back of something colossal, something that moves with deliberate, terrible grace.

A voice, neither male nor female, echoes in your mind: *"You have sailed into the domain of the Drowned King. Why do you disturb his rest?"*

Your crew falls to their knees. Some weep. Others reach for their weapons, but their hands tremble. You stand alone, the weight of their lives pressing on your shoulders.

You swallow hard. *"We didn’t know. We were lost. The storm—"*

*"The storm is his breath,"* the voice murmurs. *"The waves, his fingers. You are not the first to seek shelter here. But you may be the last."*

A figure steps forward from the city’s gates—a man, or what was once a man. His skin is the color of drowned things, his eyes hollow pits of black water. His crown is made of shipwrecks, his cloak woven from the sails of a hundred lost vessels.

*"Speak, Captain,"* the Drowned King says, his voice like the tide pulling at your bones. *"What will you give to survive this night?"*

The crew holds their breath. The sea waits.

And in that moment, you realize—this is no dream.

This is a *reckoning*.

**What do you do?**
- **Offer a sacrifice** (a crew member, a treasure, your own memory of the sea).
- **Challenge the Drowned King** (defy him, bargain with him, or try to outwit him).
- **Plead for mercy** (beg for safe passage, swear an oath, or offer a future favor).
- **Something else?** (The sea is listening. What does your heart demand?)

*(Choose, Captain. The storm is not yet done with you.)*
