...feel a warmth spread through your chest that you hadn't realized was missing until this moment.

They are wonderfully mismatched — an elderly woman with silver hair piled high and paint-stained fingers, a teenage boy with headphones around his neck still humming with tinny music, a tall person in a bright yellow raincoat despite the cloudless sky, and a tired-looking man carrying a paper bag that smells impossibly like cinnamon and something you can't quite name but that reminds you of being seven years old.

"Where are you trying to go?" the elderly woman asks, and the strange thing is — you open your mouth to answer and realize you don't know. You had forgotten. But somehow that doesn't frighten you anymore.

"I'm not sure," you admit.

And instead of looking frustrated or walking away, they all smile like this is the best possible answer you could have given.

"Perfect," says the one in the yellow raincoat. "Those are our *favorite* kind."

They lead you through streets that seem to rearrange themselves gently around your footsteps — alleyways blooming with string lights, staircases descending into plazas filled with music, bridges appearing over rivers you didn't notice before.

The city, you slowly understand, **was never the problem.**

You were just waiting for the right people to show you how to read it.

And somewhere in that wandering, you stop feeling lost entirely.
