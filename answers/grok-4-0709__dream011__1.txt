You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language you've never seen before—squiggly symbols that twist and writhe like living vines on the page. You blink, hoping it's just nerves, but when you look again, the words have shifted into riddles about your childhood memories: "What color was the bicycle you never learned to ride?" and "Why did the shadow in your closet whisper your name on rainy nights?"

Panic surges through you. You glance around the exam hall, but the other students have vanished, replaced by shadowy figures that look suspiciously like your old teachers, all grading papers with red pens that drip like blood. The clock on the wall isn't ticking—it's melting, Salvador Dalí-style, and the hands are pointing at numbers that don't exist, like 13:74. You try to write an answer, but your pencil turns into a feather, and the ink from your pen spills out as tiny fish that swim across the desk and flop onto the floor.

Desperately, you flip to the next page, only to find it's blank except for a single instruction: "Solve the puzzle of your unspoken regrets." Suddenly, the room starts spinning, and you're no longer at a desk but floating in a vast ocean of crumpled-up notes from every class you ever skipped. A voice echoes from nowhere—it's your own, but older and disappointed—asking, "Why didn't you study harder?"

Just as you're about to scream, the exam paper folds itself into an origami bird and flies away, carrying your future with it. You chase after it, but your legs feel like jelly, and the floor turns to quicksand. Then, with a jolt, you wake up in your bed, heart pounding, the alarm clock blaring. But as you reach to turn it off, you notice a single question scribbled on your hand in faded ink: "Was it all just a dream?" You laugh nervously, but deep down, you wonder if the real test is only beginning.
