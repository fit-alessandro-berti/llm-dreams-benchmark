...and the rules begin to dissolve like sugar in rain. The boardroom table stretches into an infinite hallway lined with doors that breathe softly, in and out. The other candidates are no longer people; they are silhouettes cut from old newspaper clippings, rustling nervously in a wind that doesn't touch you.

The first challenge is to carry a cup of water across the room, but the water weighs as much as a regret you haven't confessed yet. Your arms tremble, not from muscle strain, but from the heaviness of the secret. You spill a drop, and it hits the floor with the sound of a bell tolling midnight.

The second challenge is a conversation with a mirror. The reflection doesn't mimic you; it argues with you. It demands to know why you want the job. You try to speak about salary, about status, about security, but the words come out as butterflies, fluttering away before they can be heard. Finally, you whisper, "Because I want to build something that lasts." The mirror stops arguing. It smiles, and the glass turns to liquid, allowing you to step through.

You find yourself in the final room. It is empty save for a single chair and a window looking out over a city made entirely of light. The Interviewer sits in the chair, but they have no face, only a calm, warm presence.

"The job," the presence says, not with words but with a feeling that blooms in your chest, "is not to lead, or to create, or to manage."

"Then what is it?" you ask, your voice sounding like it belongs to someone else.

"To wake up," the presence replies. "The world outside is asleep. We need someone to remember it."

You reach for the contract on the desk, but the moment your finger touches the paper, the pen dissolves into smoke. The city outside the window blurs. The weight of the water cup vanishes. You realize the grand prize wasn't the position; it was the realization that you were the one holding the world together all along.

The edges of the room begin to fray into white light. You feel yourself falling upward. You take the job.

And then you open your eyes.
