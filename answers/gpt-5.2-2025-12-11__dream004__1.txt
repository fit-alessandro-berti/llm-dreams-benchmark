you come across a blank canvas and a brush that feels warm in your hand, like it’s been waiting for you specifically.

The air tastes faintly of citrus and rain. Somewhere above, a sky made of rotating polygons sighs and rearranges itself, and every time it does, the ground politely becomes something else—sand turning into sheet music, sheet music turning into shallow water, shallow water turning into a floor of soft glass that doesn’t cut, only rings.

You lift the brush. The canvas doesn’t sit on an easel; it floats at chest height, perfectly still in the chaos, as if it’s the one thing in the world that has decided to be certain.

When you touch the brush to it, color doesn’t appear as paint. It appears as sensation.

A stripe of deep blue arrives with the memory of a cold lake at night. A dot of yellow comes with a laugh you can’t place. Green is the feeling of waking up and realizing you still have time. The canvas drinks these feelings greedily and then reflects them outward, and the landscape—jealous, perhaps—starts borrowing your strokes.

Mountains assemble themselves from your lines. Trees sprout from your commas. A river unfurls from a single accidental flick of your wrist, and as it runs, it whispers words you almost understand.

“Careful,” says a voice behind you.

You turn and see someone—or something—made of shifting outlines, as if drawn in pencil and constantly being erased and redrawn. Their face never settles, but their eyes do: two steady points of charcoal certainty.

“This place copies what you put down,” they say. “The canvas isn’t blank. It’s hungry.”

You look back. The canvas is already filling in what you didn’t mean to paint: the spaces between your strokes darken like bruises. The lighter colors begin to fray at the edges. The landscape brightens and dims in sympathy, like it’s breathing with your thoughts.

You try to paint something simple, something safe: a door.

A rectangle. A knob. A shadow beneath it to make it feel real.

At once, doors appear everywhere—on the sides of floating cubes, in the middle of the sky, set into the surface of a pond like a trapdoor. They open and close in silence, like blinking.

The pencil-outlined figure steps closer and points toward the first door you painted. “That one’s yours,” they say. “The others are… interpretations.”

You reach for it. Your fingers pass through the painted wood as if it’s cool fog. The door swings inward and reveals not a room, but a corridor made entirely of unfinished sketches—half-drawn chairs, incomplete faces, a staircase that becomes a ladder halfway up, then gives up and becomes a suggestion.

Each step you take causes the corridor to redraw itself around you, trying to anticipate what you want.

You realize the brush is still in your hand.

You realize the brush is still warm.

A sound like distant applause ripples through the air, and the corridor pauses—just for a moment—as if the world is waiting for a decision.

You paint on the air in front of you: not a thing, but a rule.

You paint a thin line and decide, with all the concentration you can gather, that it means: *Hold steady.*

The line hangs there like a horizon. The shaking sketches around it hesitate. The corridor stops trying to guess. For the first time since you arrived, the world doesn’t immediately change.

It listens.

The pencil-outlined figure exhales—maybe with relief, maybe with surprise. “Most people paint objects,” they say quietly. “They don’t think to paint laws.”

You walk back out through your original door, returning to the frantic landscape of shifting shapes. But it’s different now. There’s a seam of steadiness running through it, anchored by your rule. A few forms begin to settle into gentler transformations: squares becoming circles slowly, respectfully, like a dance rather than a glitch.

The canvas floats beside you like a moon.

And now you can see faint marks on it that weren’t yours—thin scratches under the surface, like someone tried to write here before and then panicked and wiped it clean. There are patterns, almost words, but they slip away when you focus.

You paint again, cautiously: *A place to rest.*

A small bench appears in the landscape. It arrives with an audible click, like a piece snapping into a puzzle. The bench is made of the color of late afternoon. It looks solid, dependable, almost out of character for this world.

When you sit, the constant morphing of the horizon slows. The sky’s polygons drift into a calmer arrangement. The air stops tasting like rain and starts tasting like bread.

From your seated stillness, you notice something else: every color-change in the distance is tugging toward the canvas, as if the canvas is the heart that’s been beating too fast for a long time.

“Why is it hungry?” you ask.

The pencil-figure sits on the ground beside the bench, folding themselves into a shape that resembles patience. “Because it was made to catch dreams,” they say. “And dreams are made of wanting. Yours, mine, everyone’s. Over time it forgot the difference between creating and consuming.”

You look at the brush. It hums softly, like a tuning fork pressed to your pulse.

You could paint an ending: a sunrise, an exit, a neat conclusion.

But the thought of a neat conclusion feels wrong here—like trying to fold ocean waves into a box.

Instead, you paint another rule, one you didn’t know you believed until the brush begins to move:

*Nothing has to become anything else unless it wants to.*

The stroke goes down pale, almost invisible. The canvas trembles, as if that sentence is heavy.

The landscape reacts in waves. Some shapes keep shifting—joyfully, as if change is their natural language. But others stop. A crumbling arch decides to stay an arch. A cloud stops pretending to be a staircase. A tree, halfway through becoming a chandelier, laughs—an actual sound—and chooses to remain a tree.

The world becomes less frantic, more alive.

The pencil-figure’s outline sharpens. For the first time, their face holds long enough to resemble a person you might have known: someone from a memory you can’t quite retrieve.

“You’re giving it back its choice,” they whisper.

The canvas, no longer frantic, begins to reveal what was under the blankness: a layered mural, painted and repainted, dream after dream, each one leaving a trace. Not chaos—history. A record of every time someone tried to control the world with a single image, and every time the world resisted by becoming something else.

In the center, there’s a space left empty on purpose.

It’s shaped like you.

You don’t paint yourself into it. Instead, you paint a simple, unremarkable thing in the corner: a small, steady star.

Not a symbol. Not a command. Just a witness.

The star shines without trying to light everything. The canvas sighs—a deep, satisfied sound—and its warmth cools into a gentle temperature, like a hand that has stopped gripping.

The sky’s polygons settle into something like a night. A night that stays.

The pencil-figure stands, and as they do, their outline stops trembling. “That’s the trick,” they say. “Not making it perfect. Making it possible.”

You feel the pull of waking—an elevator cable tightening somewhere behind your ribs. The bench fades. The air thins. The colors soften, as if someone is turning down the saturation on the universe.

Before the last of it slips away, you glance at the canvas one final time.

The blank center remains blank.

But around it, the mural continues—quietly, slowly—painting itself with everyone’s small choices, including yours.

As you open your eyes, there’s still a trace of warmth in your fingers, like you’ve been holding a brush.

And for a moment, the white of your ceiling feels less like emptiness—

and more like a canvas that isn’t hungry at all.
