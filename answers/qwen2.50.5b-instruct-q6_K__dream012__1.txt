I see your steersman is readying his rudders against the winds of adversity. The waves reach out their hands threateningly but we hold on, our hearts pounding with the heart pounding beat beneath them. You turn towards your crew and say, "Remember the ancient Chinese saying: 'A ship without its captain weighs lighter than an empty boat when facing stormy weather.' If you cannot stand up to the storms, who's going to be brave enough to take a risk?" The crew nod in agreement, their spirits rising as we prepare for battle. You step back into the helm and command your crew to stay focused with unwavering resolve. "Remember, even when the storm begins to rage within us all, you will know our greatest strength is in our unity and how far we can go together." With that, the crew takes a deep breath and listens to your leadership guide them through the fierce waves of life ahead.
