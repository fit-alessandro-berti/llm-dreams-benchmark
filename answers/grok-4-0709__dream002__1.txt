You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the sky darkens to an unnatural shade of purple, like bruised fruit hanging low overhead. Thunder rumbles not from above, but from deep within the earth, vibrating through the roots of the ancient trees. Leaves begin to whirl in frantic spirals, and you realize they're not just leaves—they're whispering secrets in a language you almost understand, fragments of forgotten memories from your childhood.

You quicken your pace, heart pounding, seeking shelter as rain starts to fall. But this isn't ordinary rain; each drop is a tiny, glowing orb that bursts on impact, releasing bursts of color that paint the forest floor in vivid, shifting patterns. The path ahead twists unnaturally, leading you to a clearing where a massive oak tree stands, its trunk splitting open like a door. Without thinking, you step inside, and the storm's fury muffles to a distant roar.

Inside the tree, the space expands impossibly, revealing a cozy room lined with shelves of glowing books that flutter like butterflies. A figure sits at a wooden table—it's you, but older, wiser, sipping tea from a cup that refills itself. "You've been running from the storm your whole life," the other you says with a knowing smile. "But what if the storm is you?"

Before you can respond, lightning cracks through the tree's bark, and the room spins. You tumble out, back into the forest, but now the storm has passed. The sun filters through the canopy in golden beams, and the trees bow gently, as if applauding. You feel lighter, unburdened, and as you walk on, the forest fades into a misty horizon. You wake up slowly, the whisper of leaves still echoing in your ears, wondering if the dream was a message... or just the beginning of another.
