...reach for the keyboard, but the keys have turned into teeth. They chatter rhythmically, biting at my fingertips. I look up at the monitor, but it is no longer a screen; it is a window looking out onto a vast, stormy ocean made of violet ink.

"You have until the tide comes in," the boss says, but his voice sounds like it’s coming from underwater. I look at him, and he has grown ten feet tall. His face is smooth and blank, like an egg, and he is holding a stopwatch that is spinning so fast the hands are a blur.

I try to type, but my hands have turned into oversized foam gloves. I panic. "What is the assignment?" I shout, but instead of words, bubbles float out of my mouth.

"Sort the ocean," the boss booms. "Alphabetically."

The violet ink begins to spill out of the monitor, flooding the desk. The paperwork instantly dissolves into white moths that flutter up toward the fluorescent lights, which are buzzing with the sound of a thousand bees. The deadline is approaching—I can feel it as a physical heat against my back.

Desperate, I grab a pen to write something down, but the pen turns into a snake and slithers up my sleeve. The floor drops away, and suddenly my cubicle is floating in the void of space. The boss is now a giant ticking clock, floating above me.

*Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock.*

I realize the only way to finish the project is to stop time. I reach out to grab the hands of the clock, but as soon as I touch them, they turn into soft, melting chocolate. The alarm rings, but it sounds like a school bell from my childhood.

"Submission received," the clock whispers.

I lean back in my chair, which is now a cloud, and drift away as the office dissolves into starlight.
