...and you grip the ship's wheel, the worn wood slick with rain and spray. The deck pitches violently beneath your boots, a living thing trying to throw you off. Rain lashes down, blurring the frantic faces of your crew – young Alistair struggling with a sail rope that whips like a snake, grizzled Maren scanning the horizon with eyes narrowed against the gale, her expression grim.

"Hold fast!" you roar, your voice barely audible over the shriek of the wind and the crash of waves against the hull. But the wind doesn't just sound like wind anymore. It twists, forming whispers, voices just on the edge of hearing. They seem to be calling your name, promising calm waters just beyond the next impossibly tall wave, or whispering doubts about the loyalty of your first mate.

You shake your head, trying to clear it. *Focus.* A monstrous wave, a sheer wall of dark, churning water, rises directly ahead, blotting out the already bruised sky. It seems impossibly high, unnaturally steep, almost *sentient* in its malice. Your crew gasps, a collective intake of breath swallowed by the storm's fury.

Instinct takes over. "Hard to starboard! Brace yourselves!" you bellow. As you wrestle with the wheel, you glance down at the compass. The needle isn't pointing north. It's spinning erratically, not randomly, but tracing intricate, glowing sigils on the compass rose, patterns that flicker with an unsettling familiarity, like symbols from a half-forgotten nightmare.

The ship groans, timbers screaming in protest as it begins its agonizing turn. But instead of climbing the wave, the water seems to part slightly, reluctantly, as if acknowledging the glowing symbols on your compass. The wave crashes down just aft, drenching the deck and sending men sprawling, but the ship, miraculously, is still afloat, still fighting.

Looking ahead, through the driving rain, you see it. Not land, not calm seas, but something even stranger. The storm clouds ahead seem to be coalescing, taking shape. Two vast, swirling vortexes of cloud begin to resemble enormous eyes, gazing down at your struggling vessel with an ancient, unreadable intelligence. The sea beneath them glows with an eerie phosphorescence.

The whispers intensify, no longer just in the wind, but seemingly inside your own head. *Turn back... or sail into the Eye...* Your crew stares at you, their faces a mixture of terror and desperate hope. The choice, bizarre and terrifying, is yours. The dream sea awaits your command.
