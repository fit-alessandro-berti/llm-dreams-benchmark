You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to find the ancient time portal before the next sunset, or you'll be trapped here forever.

With seconds to spare, you step through, and the world dissolves into the familiar sight of your bedroom. You wake up, heart racing, but relieved it was just a dream—or was it?
