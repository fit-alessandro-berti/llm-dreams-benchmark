You find yourself frozen in the glow of your boss's impatient glare, the office lights flickering like a bad omen. Panic surges—your desk is a mess of crumpled papers and an empty coffee mug that stares back accusingly. But wait, this is a dream, right?

You type furiously, lines of code becoming golden threads that weave the project into perfection overnight. Your boss's face morphs from stern to bewildered awe as you deliver it by dawn, breaking the fourth wall of your subconscious with a triumphant laugh. You wake up sweating, promising to take longer lunch breaks from now on, but secretly wondering if you'd ace it for real. What happens next in your mind?
