**Dream Sequence:**

You wake up to the sound of birdsong and the faint scent of damp earth. The air is crisp and cool, and when you open your eyes, you see not the familiar ceiling of your bedroom, but a thatched roof with wooden beams crisscrossing above you. A single lantern flickers in the corner, casting long shadows across the stone floor.

Panic surges through you—where am I? The last thing you remember is going to sleep in your modern apartment. But this room is nothing like home. The walls are rough-hewn stone, and through a small, rattling window, you see rolling green hills under a pale dawn sky. No cars, no streetlights, no hum of electricity.

You stand, your bare feet pressing against a woven rushes on the floor. Your clothes—simple linen tunic and hose—are not yours, yet they fit perfectly. Outside, the village is stirring. Wood smoke curls from chimneys, and the distant clatter of a blacksmith’s hammer rings out. A woman in a long, flowing dress carries a bundle of herbs, greeting you with a nod.

You realize you need… *food.* Your stomach growls loudly. But how do you get it? There’s no supermarket, no delivery app.

You spot a basket of apples by the door. You take one, bite into it, and the sweetness is overwhelming—so much more intense than any modern fruit. A man outside is churning butter, his arms strong from labor. He offers you a chunk of coarse bread and a slice of cheese. It’s simple, but it fills you.

But then you realize something worse: you don’t know the rules of this place. Who are you here? A peasant? A traveler? A stranger with no history?

A group of villagers gathers near the village square. They speak in an older form of your language, but with strange words. One points at you—*do they know?* Do they recognize you as an outsider?

Then, from the edge of the forest, a horn sounds. A man on horseback rides in, his tabard marked with a unfamiliar crest. He calls out in a voice used to command: *"The lord’s men are coming to collect the tithe. All able-bodied must help."*

Your heart pounds. You don’t know what a tithe is. You don’t know if you’re free or bound. And worst of all—you don’t know if you’ll ever wake up.

What do you do?

(Should we continue? Or shall you dream this alone?)
