You start to walk, hoping movement will spark some memory or clue. The streets are a labyrinth of gleaming towers and narrow, shadowy alleys, all under a sky the color of tarnished silver. No street signs look familiar, and the few people you pass move with averted eyes, as if avoiding your unspoken question.

Then you notice your hand is closed tightly around something. You open your palm. Inside is a small, smooth stone, dark blue like a deep night sky, and a neatly folded slip of paper you don’t remember receiving.

You unfold the paper. The handwriting is your own.

*“Follow the birds that are not there. Listen for the clock that strikes between hours. The door is where the shadow of the spire touches the dry fountain at the wrong time.”*

You look up. A flock of pigeons scatters from a rooftop, but their movement leaves a faint, shimmering trail in the air—a ghostly echo of larger, slower wings. You follow the fading shimmer down a cobbled lane.

From somewhere, you hear a deep, resonant *bong*—though your watch reads 2:07. The sound seems to pull you left. You turn a corner and see a Gothic spire piercing the low clouds. Its long shadow stretches across a small, deserted square with a bone-dry fountain in the center.

You wait, your heart a drum against your ribs. As a strange, slow cloud passes before the sun, the shadow leaps, stretching impossibly long for a moment. The tip of the spire’s shadow touches the center of the dry fountain basin.

Where the stone shadow meets the stone bowl, a door shimmers into existence—old, dark wood with an iron ring.

You take a breath, grasp the cool iron, and pull. The meeting, you now understand, is not with a person, but with a part of yourself you’d forgotten. You step through.
