...walk through streets that keep shifting their geometry. The buildings lean in like curious observers, their windows reflecting not my face but versions of me from different moments—younger, older, wearing clothes I've never owned.

I reach into my pocket for my phone to find directions, but instead I pull out a small brass compass. Its needle spins wildly, then points down, through the pavement.

Of course. The meeting is *below*.

I find a staircase where a moment ago there was only a flower vendor selling blooms that smell like old books. The stairs spiral deeper than they should, and with each step down, I remember a little more about what this meeting is for—though the knowledge keeps slipping away like water through fingers.

At the bottom, there's a door made of frosted glass. Through it, I can see silhouettes already seated around a table, waiting. They turn toward me in unison. One of them might be someone I haven't seen in years. Another has my grandmother's posture.

I realize I'm not late at all. I'm exactly when I'm supposed to be.

My hand reaches for the door handle, which is warm, almost alive—

*And this is where the dream hands itself to you, if you want to tell me what's behind the door. Or we can leave it here, in that suspended moment of almost-knowing.*
