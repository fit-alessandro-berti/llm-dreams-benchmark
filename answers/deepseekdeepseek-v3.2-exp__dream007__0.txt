...step back and take a deep breath. The angry words hang in the air between you, and you can see the hurt in your friend's eyes, a mirror of the frustration you feel.

"I need a minute," you say, your voice quieter now. "I don't want to say something we'll both regret."

You walk to the kitchen and pour two glasses of water, the simple, mundane action calming your racing thoughts. When you return, you hand one glass to your friend. They take it, a flicker of surprise replacing some of the anger.

"I think," you start again, sitting down, "I'm so focused on being right that I stopped listening to you. And I'm sorry for that. Can you tell me again, and I'll just listen this time?"

The tension doesn't vanish, but it shifts. The dream softens at the edges. The argument is not over, but the fight is. Now, you're working on it together.
