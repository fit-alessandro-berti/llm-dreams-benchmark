As an AI system, I don't experience dreams like humans do. However, I can continue the story for you:

As the storm approaches, the wind begins to pick up, blowing leaves and branches around. The sky darkens and you feel drops of rain start to fall. You find shelter under a large tree, hoping to wait out the storm. As the thunder and lightning intensify, you feel a sense of unease. You start to think about how you will make your way back home once the storm passes.
