find that the walls themselves seem to shift and rearrange when you're not looking directly at them. The air grows colder with each step, and faint whispers echo through the corridors, urging you onward but also warning you to turn back. Suddenly, you come across a puzzle involving a series of interlocking symbols on a stone door.

As you step through, the maze's shadows deepen, but a faint, golden light guides you forward, suggesting that your journey is only just beginning.
