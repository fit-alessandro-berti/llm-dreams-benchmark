...take a deep breath and step back. But as you open your mouth to speak, your words come out as butterflies—dozens of them, fluttering between you in the strange light that now fills the room.

Your friend reaches out to catch one, and when they do, their face suddenly shifts into someone else's—your childhood self, looking up at you with confused eyes. "Why are you so angry?" they ask, but their voice sounds like wind chimes.

You realize you're no longer in a room but standing on an endless staircase that spirals both up and down simultaneously. Each step you try to take feels like walking through honey. Your friend (or are they still your friend?) is now several steps away, or maybe several years away—the distance keeps changing.

The important thing you were arguing about... you can still feel its weight in your chest, heavy and urgent, but when you try to remember what it was, you can only picture a locked box that keeps changing colors. Red, then blue, then a color that doesn't exist but somehow you recognize it.

You want to apologize, or maybe you want them to apologize, but the butterflies are still pouring from your mouth, and now they're carrying away pieces of the argument, each one taking a word you can no longer retrieve.

The dream feeling deepens—that familiar frustration of knowing something matters desperately while it simultaneously dissolves into nonsense.
