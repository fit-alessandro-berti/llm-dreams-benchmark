...you overhear intriguing conversations that pique your curiosity. The first group is discussing a recent scientific discovery that allows for time travel, but it's only accessible to those who can solve a complex mathematical equation. Another group is sharing their experiences with lucid dreaming, claiming they can control their dreams and even invite others into them.

Despite being sidetracked by these fascinating discussions, you continue searching for your friend. Soon, you come across a group playing an intense game of chess. One player makes an extraordinary move, and the crowd gasps in awe. You lean in to get a better look when suddenly, someone taps you on the shoulder.

It's your old college roommate, who you hadn't seen in years! They invite you to join them for a drink, and you gladly accept, realizing that maybe finding your original friend wasn't the most important thing after all. As you chat and catch up, you can't help but think about how surreal and unexpected this dream has become. But that's the beauty of dreams – they often take us on unexpected journeys and introduce us to new people and ideas.
