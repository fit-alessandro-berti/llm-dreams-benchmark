You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the world seems to hold its breath. The canopy above shivers, and the sunlight fractures into shards of gold that dissolve into a cold, bruised violet. The air grows heavy with the scent of damp earth and something metallic—like iron filings brushed against a wind‑blown blade.

A low rumble rolls through the trees, not just thunder but a chorus of distant voices, each one echoing a memory you never lived. The ground beneath your feet softens, turning from leaf‑covered loam to a shallow pool of dark water that reflects not your face but a series of ever‑shifting silhouettes—children laughing, an empty staircase, a clock with its hands spinning backward. Every ripple carries a whisper: *listen, remember, let go.*

A wind gusts through the trunks, snapping twigs like brittle bones. Leaves, once green and complacent, turn into flocks of dark, featherless wings that swirl and converge toward a single point—a clearing you’ve never noticed before. In the center stands a stone altar, its surface etched with symbols that pulse faintly, as if they were heartbeats.

You step forward, drawn by an unseen tide. The rain begins—not the gentle patter you expected, but a cascade of translucent ribbons that descend like ribbons of light. Each drop carries a tiny ember of color, painting the forest floor with fleeting constellations. As the storm reaches its crescendo, the storm itself seems to breathe. The thunder rolls again, this time not as a warning but as a low, rhythmic chant, and the forest responds in kind: branches sway in perfect sync, their leaves humming a low, resonant tone.

At the heart of the rain‑lit clearing, the altar’s surface shines brighter. A hand—your hand, yet not yours—reaches out and lifts a crystal sphere from the stone. Inside, a miniature storm rages, swirling with the same violet‑streaked sunlight that bathed the canopy moments before. The sphere pulses, and a soft voice—your own voice but older, wiser—speaks:

*“Every ending is a seed. Every storm, a story waiting to be told.”*

When you close your fingers around the sphere, the world around you blurs. The forest fades, the rain retreats, and you are no longer walking but floating—weightless, suspended between the canopy and the sky. The colors bleed into one another, and you realize you are not merely a wanderer but the keeper of this storm, the one who can summon or calm it with a thought.

A distant flash of lightning forks across the horizon, illuminating a ribbon of silver that stretches toward a distant mountain range. You know, in that moment, that the journey will continue beyond this dream, that each step forward is both a walk and a windswept flight.

And then—just as the dream seems to teeter on the edge of waking—you feel the gentle press of a hand on your shoulder. It’s a familiar figure, someone you love, smiling softly. They whisper, “It’s time to bring this storm back with you.” The scent of pine and rain deepens, and the forest awakens once more, but now it carries within it the echo of the storm you just walked through.

You open your eyes, the room of your waking world bathed in a soft, gray light. The rain outside your window begins to fall, each drop a reminder of the dream you just lived, and you know that whenever the sky darkens, you’ll carry that storm inside you, ready to walk the forest again—this time with the sky as your companion.
