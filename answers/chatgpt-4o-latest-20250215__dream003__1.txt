symbols etched into its surface—geometric shapes that seem to shift ever so slightly when viewed from different angles. The material of the box is neither wood nor metal, but something in between, warm to the touch yet impossibly smooth. 

Running your fingers along the edges, you find a faint indentation on one side, shaped like a perfect circle. As you press it, a soft hum resonates from within the box, and the patterns begin to glow with an eerie blue light. Suddenly, the air around you grows heavy, as if the very fabric of reality is pressing inward.

A whisper echoes in your mind, a voice neither male nor female, speaking in a language you don’t recognize—yet somehow, you understand:  

_"The key is not a key. The lock is not a lock. See beyond the form, and you shall find the way."_  

You close your eyes, focusing on the box, trying to perceive it beyond its physical shape. A sudden rush of sensation overwhelms you—images flashing through your mind of distant stars, endless corridors, and a doorway standing in the void.  

When you open your eyes, the box is no longer in your hands. Instead, it floats before you, unfolding like a puzzle rearranging itself. The glowing symbols spin and merge, revealing a swirling vortex at its center. A choice presents itself—step forward into the unknown or wake up and never know what lay beyond.  

What do you do?
