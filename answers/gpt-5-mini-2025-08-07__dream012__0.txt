grip the wheel until your knuckles whiten. Rain bites the air like thrown knives; the wind speaks in torn flags and the rigging screams. Around you, faces blur into the salt-slick gloom — young hands fumbling with unfamiliar ropes, an old deckhand who hums to himself as if the tune could stitch the sky back together. They wait for something steadier than weather: your direction, your calm.

You draw breath and find your voice. Not a shout but a steady line of sound, an order that folds into itself and comes back as obedience. "Batten down, foretopman—sonar the lee!" The crew moves as if the commands were carved into the planks. You bark for the canvas to be reefed, for the helm to be steadied, for every loose thing to be made small. The ship answers you, wood and iron and salt, rocking under your hands but listening.

Lightning cracks the world into film negatives; for a moment you see each face lit and then snuffed. One of the younger sailors tries to steer by sight, eyes wild, and you take his arm. You feel his pulse against the bone of your wrist, a quick thing that matches the rhythm in your own chest. You tell him to breathe. He does. You tell the others to tighten lines, to trust the sound of your voice more than the sky.

The storm seems to widen into a thing with its own intentions. Waves rear up like walls, their crests crowned with foam that glows faintly, as if moonlight lives inside it. You find yourself steering not away from the greatest waves but toward them — not reckless, but deliberate — because the path that skirts a storm shreds you with surprises; into the heart, you reckon, the motion will settle.

As you aim the bow inward, the world slows. The roar distills into a single tone, like the hum of a distant choir suspended under the water. Rain becomes a film of silver that paints the deck; the crew's faces grow softer, then younger, older, then the faces of people you loved and left behind. You realize the sea is cataloguing you: every compromise, every courage. It throws memories at you in the same rhythm as the waves.

You do not feel fear, only a fierce clarity. Orders are given and obeyed. You lower your gaze and see a small thing, almost absurdly mundane — a child's wooden boat, lodged against the bowsprit, its paint flaked to the grain. No one knows how it got there. Someone laughs, and the sound is pure enough to cleave the storm. The crew takes it as omen and rallies.

Finally, the center opens like a held breath released. The waves fold into a bowl of glass; rain hangs suspended. There is a small, impossible calm at the eye. In that silence you hear, oddly, a single woodwind note: the same song the old deckhand hummed. The sea around you breathes out, and for an instant the horizon is a promise instead of a threat.

You steer into that calm, and everything that was frightening no longer feels unmanageable — only heavy with meaning. When the clouds begin to thin, the crew exhales as one body. You realize the storm was never merely weather; it was an invitation to remember what you will and what you won't carry forward.

Dawn comes slow and pale. The spray dries on your hands, the ropes smell of distant harbors, and the horizon holds the silhouette of land conspiring to take you back to ordinary things. You hand the wheel to the young sailor you steadied and, for the first time in a long while, let your shoulders lower. The crew laughs, quiet and shaken, and someone cracks open a can of coffee.

You wake with your hands still curled as if round a wheel, the taste of salt on your tongue. For a breath you are still captain, and you carry with you the calm you found in the eye — the knowledge that storms will come, but that steady hands, clear orders, and the courage to steer into the dark can bring you through.
