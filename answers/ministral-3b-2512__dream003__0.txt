**Dream Continuation:**

The box isn’t just locked—it’s *alive*. The intricate patterns on its surface pulse faintly, like veins of liquid silver or swirling ink, shifting when you blink. A low, rhythmic hum fills the air, vibrating through your bones. The wood or metal feels warm, almost *breathing*, and when you reach out, your fingers brush against something—soft, yet solid as stone. A single, perfect seed, no larger than your thumbnail, rests in the center of the pattern. It’s not just a seed; it’s a *key*.

But the key doesn’t open the box. Instead, it *unfolds*. The lid lifts on its own, revealing a hollow space filled with layers of darkness. The deeper you look, the more you realize: the box isn’t a container. It’s a *threshold*. A doorway to something that doesn’t exist in the waking world.

A voice—soft as wind through dead leaves—whispers from the shadows: *"You’ve found the right one."* The seed in your palm begins to glow, casting a golden light over your hands. The patterns on the box rearrange themselves into a map: a winding path through a forest of words, a bridge of silence, and a cave where time bends like a river. But the voice adds, *"Not all paths lead to the same place."* The box tilts slightly, revealing a hidden compartment. Inside, a single word is carved into the wood: **"Choose."**

You hesitate. The seed pulses faster. The hum grows louder, like a heartbeat. Then—*you move*. Your hand drifts toward the seed, but before you can touch it, the box *shuts*. The lid slams shut with a sound like a door closing on a storm. The light inside dims. The voice lingers: *"The choice was yours. But the box remembers."* You wake with a gasp, your palm still tingling where the seed had been.

**What do you think the box represents in your dream?**
(Is it a metaphor for a decision you’re facing? A hidden part of yourself? Or something else entirely?)
