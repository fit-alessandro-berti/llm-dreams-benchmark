...and as you move deeper into the maze, you feel the air grow thinner, almost crystalline, and a low hum resonates through the very structure. The puzzles... they don't just get harder in terms of logic. They start to incorporate *other* things.

One might be a vast, silent room where you have to arrange colors that shouldn't exist, guided only by a feeling of 'rightness.' Another could be a corridor where the floor is a giant chessboard, but the pieces are made of light and you have to predict moves based on emotional states you can only vaguely sense. Some puzzles require you to listen to whispers that seem to come from the stone itself, translating them into a forgotten language you feel you once knew.

The walls are no longer just stone. They ripple like water, or become transparent, revealing glimpses of impossible landscapes – upside-down forests, oceans under a sky of stars during the day. The light sources are erratic, sometimes brilliant, sometimes dim, casting long, dancing shadows that seem to mock your efforts.

You feel your mind stretching, bending in ways it never has before. Concentration becomes an almost physical weight, yet solving a puzzle brings not just relief, but a strange, fleeting euphoria, a burst of pure understanding that vanishes the moment you step through to the next section. You lose track of how long you've been walking, how many puzzles you've solved. The 'deeper' isn't just spatial; it feels like you're moving through layers of consciousness, or perhaps towards a central truth the maze is trying to reveal... or perhaps conceal.

The hum grows louder, the light more intense. The next section isn't another room, but a shimmering curtain of light. As you reach out to touch it, the maze seems to dissolve behind you, and the light wraps around you, pulling you forward into... well, you don't know. It's the edge of the dream, the transition point. The feeling is one of inevitability, of reaching the core of the maze's mystery. And then... the light is everything, and there are no more puzzles, just a profound sense of *knowing* before the knowing itself begins to fade.
