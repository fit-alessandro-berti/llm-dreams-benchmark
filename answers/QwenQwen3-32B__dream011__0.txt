You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written not in ink, but in shimmering, liquid light that shifts colors as you try to focus. The first question hovers above the page, glowing softly:  

**"What would you sacrifice to save someone you love—your talent, your time, or your truth?"**  

Your heartbeat echoes in the silent room. Around you, other students are vanishing, their chairs collapsing into dust as they answer. You reach for your pen, but it transforms into a key. Panicked, you realize the exam isn’t about writing answers—it’s about *choosing* them. The second question materializes, colder now, blue as ice:  

**"If you could live forever in a world without surprise, or die knowing one miracle was waiting around the corner, which would you choose?"**  

The walls of the exam hall ripple like water. A clock on the wall ticks backward. You glance at your classmates; their faces are mirrors reflecting your own, each one aging and fading with every second. The third question arrives, splitting the air like a thunderclap:  

**"What is the name of the person who first made you feel invisible? And the name of the one who made you infinite?"**  

You stagger back. The key in your hand grows warm, pulsing in time with your pulse. The seat beneath you dissolves, and you’re falling through a tunnel of questions—endless, glowing, *alive*. Then, a voice, not from the exam but from your own throat:  

**"I don’t need answers. I need to ask my own questions."**  

The tunnel explodes into light. You wake up in your bed, the morning sun on your face, a pen in your hand, and a blank exam paper on your desk—its questions still waiting, still shifting, forever unfinished.  

You smile. Today, you bring your own questions.
