Ancient symbols etched into its surface. The patterns seem familiar yet foreign, reminiscent of a language long forgotten. You close your eyes, feeling the cool metal against your palms, and you're transported to an ethereal realm, floating amidst swirling cosmic clouds.

In this dreamscape, celestial bodies align, forming constellations that pulse with light. Suddenly, one of these stars begins to glow more brightly than the rest—it's beckoning you. As you approach it, the star splits open, revealing an ancient scribe with a quill and parchment floating in zero-gravity.

The scribe gestures for you to come closer. As you move nearer, the symbols on your box start to glow, mirroring the ones etched onto the parchment. The scribe begins writing furiously, and with each stroke of his quill, a symbol from the parchment imprints itself onto your lock, deciphering its code.

The process is slow but steady, and as the final symbol locks into place on the box, you feel a surge of understanding—a knowing that you are the chosen one, tasked with safeguarding something profound. The scribe smiles, bows, then vanishes back into the constellations.

You open your eyes to find yourself back in reality, holding the now-unlocked box. Inside lies an orb of pure, radiant light, pulsating gently with the same ancient symbols etched on the box's surface. You realize this orb holds immense wisdom and power, whispering secrets of cosmic knowledge only you can decipher. It’s a responsibility heavy with mystery and wonder, marking the start of your celestial journey.
