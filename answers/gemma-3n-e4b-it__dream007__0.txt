You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **stop talking. Just... stop.** 

The air thickens with the sudden silence. It’s not a peaceful silence, though. It's charged, vibrating with unspoken words and simmering resentment. We’re standing in a brightly colored, almost cartoonish park, the kind with impossibly green grass and flowers that change color every few seconds. It feels utterly surreal, a stark contrast to the intensity of our feelings.

I turn away, unable to meet their gaze. I focus on a single, oversized dandelion pushing its way through the perfectly manicured lawn. Its yellow head seems impossibly bright, a defiant splash of color against the manufactured perfection. I can feel their presence behind me, a heavy weight of disappointment and frustration. 

Instead of trying to explain, instead of defending my position, I just close my eyes and take a deep breath. The scent of honeysuckle is overwhelmingly sweet, almost cloying. I try to conjure up memories of all the good times we’ve shared – late-night talks, shared jokes, comforting shoulders – but they seem distant, blurry, like faded photographs.

Then, I start to hum. It’s a simple melody, a lullaby my grandmother used to sing. Not a forceful, defiant hum, but a soft, almost mournful one. It feels… necessary. A way to acknowledge the hurt, to acknowledge the loss of connection in this moment.

Slowly, I open my eyes. My friend is still standing there, watching me. Their expression is unreadable. They don’t say anything, don’t try to re-open the conversation. Just stands, in the perfectly manicured park, as I hum my grandmother’s lullaby, the sound echoing strangely in the unnaturally quiet air.  The dandelion shimmers, its yellow turning a vibrant, pulsating gold. And a single tear rolls down my cheek, catching the light like a tiny, iridescent gem. I have no idea what happens next, but for now, humming feels like the only thing I can do. It feels… like a beginning.
