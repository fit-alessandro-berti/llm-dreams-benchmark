…and you realize the wind arrives before the clouds, slipping between the trunks with a cool, practiced hand. The leaves turn their pale undersides as if showing you the other face of green. Birds tuck their songs away. The air smells like wet stone and the shadow of metal. Your skin prickles. Somewhere far off, thunder clears its throat in a language you almost remember.

The path rucks up like a ribbon and then smooths itself, as if the forest is trying to look composed for a guest. You feel the first drops long before they fall—round, patient weights hanging in the sky, waiting for a signal. Your heartbeat and the thunder fall into step. It isn’t just weather; it is something you know, a feeling you once put down and forgot where.

Ahead, the trees part around a clearing you don’t remember walking toward. In the center lies a small lake, dark as a pupil, its surface unnaturally still. Above it the sky is a tight knot of black and silver, a crowded ballroom of clouds. Below, in the lake’s reflection, none of that exists. The water shows a tranquil night studded with stars you’ve never seen, slow and stray as lanterns. You kneel and the two skies meet your face: cold weather above, quiet cosmos below.

A hung bell dangles from a limb at the clearing’s edge, tarnished, the clapper missing. Your name is scratched into its side backwards, as if it had been written from inside the metal. You reach to touch it and feel a thread of static run into your fingertips. The bell does not ring, but the air does. Sound moves through the ground like a ripple in a glass tabletop, making the ferns quiver.

It begins to rain—not hard, a rehearsed dripping at first, spaced apart enough to count them. Each drop that strikes your skin blooms a tiny chill and a word you can’t keep, syllables that evaporate before they settle. The forest listens with you. Lightning arrives in the shape of crooked antlers behind the clouds, a deer made of light pacing the edges of the sky. When it steps forward, it steps into the lake and his hooves do not break the surface. He is not made of anything you can touch, but the idea of him is heavy. He lowers his head, and when you lift your hand, the shock that leaps between you is not pain but recognition. The storm has a face.

You raise your arms without meaning to, and the wind braids between your fingers like ribbons on a maypole. Somewhere, a door opens inside your ribs and lets out a flock of moths—your fears, your lists, tiny parchment wings labeled with every small catastrophe you have rehearsed. They batter at the rain for a moment, then find it warm. They fold themselves into it and dissolve. For a few seconds the drops are soft and luminous, as if milk has been poured into the air.

You step onto the lake. This is a dream, so of course you don’t sink. Your weight is the kind that water understands. The surface creaks faintly like a polished floorboard. The reflection of the other sky accepts you, stars winking at your ankles as if they are shy. Above, thunder braids itself into a drumbeat; below, silence drinks it without a ripple. You walk toward the center and the storm walks with you, antlered and restless. The rain intensifies, each drop a small bell, bright and precise, striking your shoulders in a constellation you are certain has your name in it.

Lightning stitches the sky, quick and clean, and where it strikes the lake it writes for you in vapor. Take off your fear, the letters say. You laugh because of how ordinary the sentence is, and because you thought you had, dates ago, years. But the words are stubborn. So you shrug out of something that isn’t a coat until it is. It falls from your shoulders shimmering, heavy with what you’ve gathered—thin ails and thick ones, habits of holding your breath, the old rain you keep in jars on a shelf just in case. The coat hits the water and does not sink. It floats away like a raft, and you feel air move around the place it left, as if you have taken a window out of the wall of yourself.

The stag made of weather bows, and the next time thunder speaks, you hear it as your own voice amplified and stretched out until it touches the horizon. It says two things at once: Stay, and Go. You take both as permission.

When you climb him—how else would you, when he bends his neck like that—it is like stepping into wind that has been braided just for your hands and feet. You ride up, not in a leap, but in a slow gathering, as if the storm is lifting you the way a tree lifts water. Leaves blur below, green smears, then a darker green, then lace. The forest’s breath becomes one long exhale under you. From above, rain is a city glowing. You look down and see yourself walking a hundred different paths between the trees you have already passed and the ones you have not found yet. You wave to every version.

You are not afraid of the height. Dream height is nothing like waking height. Up here you can see that the storm has edges, that it is not forever, that beyond it fields are already steaming in new sunlight. You can also see a small house standing where no house stood before, a house without walls, only a table set for someone who has always been late. On the table there is a cup. It is catching rain and filling itself with a soft, electrical tea. You know without being told that if you drink it you will remember the thing you keep forgetting on purpose. You leave it there, for later, for some other you who needs it.

When the stag brings you down again, you are back by the bell. The rain is thinning, unraveling into threads you could spool around your wrist. The storm lifts its weight easily off the forest, as if it had only been trying on a coat in a mirror. The bell finally makes a sound, not a toll but a small polite clearing of the throat, and a drop falls from its lip and lands on your lower lip. It is the exact taste of the first time you ever walked home in rain that felt like a choice.

You look at your hands and there is a key in one of them, slick and warm as if it has just been held tightly by something with weather for fingers. It looks like lightning frozen on its way to ground. You slip it into your pocket because you do not see any locks. The forest brightens, not with sunlight, not yet, but with a shy glow from the ground where mushrooms have summoned their little lamps. Snails write silver flourishes on the damp bark as if signing their names to the evening. The birds unbox their songs again, one at a time, tentative at first and then brazen.

You check the trees. None of them are quite where they were, though they pretend very well. The path appears, not straight but sure, every puddle a small mirror you can step into if you want to see a different sky. You start walking. You are lighter by something you didn’t know you were carrying, heavier by a key that you will not lose, and somewhere behind you the storm looks over its shoulder as it leaves, then nods, satisfied.

When you wake, your hair smells faintly of wet pine, and on your tongue there is the memory of an electric sweetness you can’t name. For a second, you think you hear a distant bell regarding you from a world away—an inside-out chime—and you answer it by breathing in, as if the sky has just become a place you can keep.
