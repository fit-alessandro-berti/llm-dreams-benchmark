…step outside to cool down. The air is thick and golden, like late afternoon honey. Words from the argument are still ringing in your head as your friend follows you, their footsteps echoing in a way that doesn't sound quite right. You turn to them, ready to continue, but realize their face is blurry, as if it’s underwater.

A streetlamp flickers above you; suddenly, you’re not outside your house, but on a long, winding bridge that stretches over a deep mist. Your friend stands at the other end, calling your name, voice echoing as if you’re underwater too. Every step you take toward them, the bridge stretches farther.

Your friend calls again, softer, and now both of you are back in the room where the argument began. The words you were fighting about are written on slips of paper that drift down from the ceiling like snow. The anger has faded, replaced with a heavy feeling of regret—and yet, when you reach out to touch your friend’s hand, you find they are holding one of the paper slips, offering it back to you, their face finally clear and forgiving.

You both laugh, quietly, not remembering what the argument was ever really about.
