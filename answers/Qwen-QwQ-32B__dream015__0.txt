... press onward toward a flickering light on the horizon. The air is thick with ash, each breath a struggle, but the light pulls you like a siren’s song. As you approach, the ruins shift—crumbling concrete gives way to the hum of a geothermal generator, its steam coiling into the smoke-choked sky. Behind it, something impossible: a garden. Not the skeletal remains of plants you’ve scavenged for weeks, but **vibrant greenery**—tomatoes swelling on vines, sunflowers bowing under their own weight, and a fig tree casting dappled shade over a stone well. 

A figure emerges, cloaked in a patchwork of scavenged fabrics. “You’re not a raider,” they say, voice frayed but warm. You realize it’s an old woman, her hands stained with soil and ink—she’s scribbling in a weathered notebook. “They all run when they see the light. You’re the first to come closer.” 

She gestures to the garden. “This isn’t just plants. It’s equations. Hydroponic cycles, solar stills, **\( \frac{3}{4} \) efficiency** on the water pumps…” Her eyes glint with manic pride. “The world didn’t end for me. I just… started over.” 

But as you step closer, you notice the garden’s edges: barbed wire strung with **glowing moss** (bioluminescent? toxic?), and the well’s rope frayed to a single strand. Is this an oasis—or a trap? The choice crystallizes: stay and learn her secrets, or flee with the knowledge that survival might not require abandoning humanity. 

“What’s your name?” she asks, still writing. The notebook’s pages are filled with sketches of gears and… **human faces**. 

You hesitate, the garden’s warmth contrasting the howling wind beyond. Somewhere in the chaos, a bell tolls—a sound you haven’t heard in years.
