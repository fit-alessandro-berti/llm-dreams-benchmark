…save something beautiful.

You crouch by the cracked pavement where a single blade of grass pushes stubbornly through the concrete. The wind smells like dust and old rain. Around you, skeletons of shopping malls and rusted buses lean like tired beasts; overhead, a sky bruised purple with smog keeps time with the croak of distant metal. It would be easy—logical, even—to keep walking, to horde what you can and hide. Instead you slide your palm into the soil and feel, absurdly, the cool, wet promise of life.

You choose to cultivate. You scavenge glass, wires, and plastic panels, turning an overturned tram into a greenhouse. You teach yourself to trap dew on the corrugated roof, to rig reflectors from broken mirrors and to coax sprouts from seed packets found in a library that smelled of mold and ink. Neighbors—skeptical at first, scarred and guarded—watch you light a small, steady lantern each night beside the green bed. They start to bring shells of food, a threadbare blanket, a handful of saved water. They begin to stay. You barter repair knowledge and stories for labor and laughter. The tram fills with herbs and small lettuces, with children's paintings pinned to the windows. It becomes, in increments, less post-apocalypse and more possibility.

Danger doesn't disappear. Raiders patrol the highways, scavenging drones hum like patient wasps, and storms still unmake the streets. But you learn to listen: the cadence of footsteps that are friendly, the pattern of the drones' patrols, the weather's first small change. You build warning bells from cans and string, teach a nightly lookout how to map the stars again, and trade with a lone mechanic for a rainwater condenser. Each small success feels like a stitch in a ragged garment—vulnerable, but warming.

One dawn, after months of careful tending, you step inside the tram and find a child asleep in the heat of the greenhouse, palms cupping a sprig of basil. She wakes and hands you a crude paper flower she'd made from a map. Her grin is half-sunbeam, half-dare. Around you, the little plot of green spreads, creeping over cracked asphalt in a defiant line. You realize you haven't just saved a plant; you've become part of the slow, stubborn business of making a world worth living in. The dream tightens, sweet and fragile, like the first leaf of spring—and then, in a quiet, ridiculous way, you wake with soil under your fingernails, smiling at the ordinary miracle of a houseplant on your windowsill.
