{# Scavenger's Dream

You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to venture beyond the relative safety of your makeshift shelter in search of both supplies and purpose.

The sky above is a strange shade of amber, casting everything in a golden haze. Buildings stand half-collapsed, nature reclaiming concrete and steel with determined vines and roots. As you walk, your footsteps echo unnaturally, as if the sound is slightly delayed.

You discover an abandoned library, its windows shattered but most books mysteriously intact. Something compels you to enter. Inside, you find not just books, but a small community of survivors who've transformed the space into a knowledge sanctuary. They collect and preserve information, believing that rebuilding civilization requires remembering what came before.

The leader, an elderly woman with eyes that seem to shift color as she speaks, offers you a choice: join them as a knowledge keeper, or become a messenger who carries crucial information between the scattered survivor settlements.

The dream shifts, and suddenly you're standing at a crossroads, your decision somehow already made, though you don't remember making it. The path ahead winds through a landscape that transforms with each step you take—desert to forest to ruined city—as if the world itself is unsure what it wants to be.

Despite everything, there's a strange hope in this dream. Even at the end of everything, you've found purpose in connecting people and preserving what might otherwise be lost.
