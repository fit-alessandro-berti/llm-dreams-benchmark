You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **adapt quickly to survive in this medieval world of thatched huts, muddy lanes, and flickering torchlight**.

The air smells of woodsmoke and fresh-baked bread from a nearby village. Distant clangs of blacksmith hammers echo, and villagers in rough woolen tunics eye you warily—your strange clothes mark you as an outsider, perhaps a traveler from afar or worse, a spy. No smartphones, no cars, no electricity; just the raw pulse of feudal life in what feels like 14th-century England.

Hunger gnaws at you first. You spot a market stall piled with apples, loaves, and smoked fish, but coinless and accentless, bartering is your only shot. A burly merchant grunts, "What ya got to trade, stranger?" Your modern watch? Useless trinket here. You improvise, offering a tale of "distant lands" in exchange for bread, your words weaving just enough wonder to earn a crust.

Thirst leads you to a rushing stream, but as you drink, hoofbeats thunder—a lord's patrol on horseback, armored and suspicious. "Halt! State yer business!" their captain barks. Thinking fast, you claim to be a wandering healer (your vague knowledge of basic first aid might pass). It works; they escort you to the castle, where rumors of plague have the court desperate.

Inside the stone-walled great hall, flickering candles illuminate tapestries of dragons and kings. The lady of the manor, pale and feverish, needs aid. You recall antibiotics are centuries away, so you improvise with willow bark tea (nature's aspirin) and clean bandages from boiled linens. She recovers overnight, earning you favor: a squire's tunic, a dagger, and a horse.

But whispers spread—you're no ordinary healer. A rival sorcerer accuses you of witchcraft. Trial by fire looms. Do you flee into the misty woods, rally villagers with tales of "future wonders," or challenge the sorcerer to a duel of wits? The dream fractures here, choices branching like roots in the earth... what path do you take next?
