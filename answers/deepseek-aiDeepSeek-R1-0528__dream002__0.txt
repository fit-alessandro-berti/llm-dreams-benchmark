The peaceful forest darkens abruptly. The canopy thrashes as wind tears through the trees, whipping leaves into frenzied spirals. Thunder cracks overhead—not a distant rumble, but a bone-shaking explosion that splits the sky. Rain lashes down, icy and stinging, turning the soft earth to slick mud beneath your feet. 

You stumble, heart pounding, as lightning forks across the violet-black clouds, illuminating the woods in stark, terrifying flashes. In one blinding instant, you see them: **shapes moving within the storm**. Not animals—tall, slender figures woven from shadow and wind, their forms flickering like static. They glide between the trees, silent but for the howl of the gale that seems to breathe from them.  

One darts toward you, a wisp of darkness with eyes like smoldering embers. You scramble backward, slipping on wet roots, when a second bolt of lightning strikes an ancient oak mere yards away. The tree explodes in a shower of splinters and blue-white fire. The concussion throws you to the ground, ears ringing.  

As you push yourself up, gasping, the rain suddenly… *changes*. It’s no longer water. **Glowing stones**, smooth and warm as river pebbles, patter down around you. They hit the mud with soft *thuds*, casting pools of amber light that push back the oppressive dark. You catch one—it pulses gently in your palm, radiating calm.  

The shadow figures recoil from the light, hissing like steam. They melt into the downpour, vanishing as quickly as they appeared. The wind eases, the thunder fading to a grumble. In the newfound quiet, a path reveals itself: the glowing stones lead deeper into the forest, illuminating a trail toward a colossal, lightning-scarred cedar.  

At its base, a door-shaped hollow glimmers, veiled by cascading moss. The stone in your hand flares brighter, pulling you forward. As you step through the threshold, the storm’s fury cuts off abruptly. Inside, it’s dry and still. Bioluminescent fungi cling to the walls, painting the air soft blue. A voice, ancient and kind, echoes from the wood itself: *"Rest. The storm outside is not yours to weather."*  

You sink onto a bed of moss, the glowing stone cradled against your chest. Outside, the tempest rages on—but here, in the heart of the tree, you are safe. The dream softens, fading into the deep, quiet dark of true sleep...  

*(The dream ends here, leaving you with the lingering warmth of the stone and the cedar’s whispered promise.)*
