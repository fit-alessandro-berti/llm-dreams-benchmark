suddenly realize the project isn’t a project at all—it’s a living, breathing entity made of tangled wires and flickering code, coiled on your desk like a metallic serpent. Your boss, whose face is now blurred at the edges, slides a single sheet of paper toward you. It reads:

**"Deliver a solution by 5 p.m. Today."**

You look at the clock—it’s already 4:59 p.m.

Your hands move, but they aren’t your hands. They’re made of light, typing commands that dissolve as they hit the keyboard. The walls of the office begin to melt into streams of data—emails, calendar invites, Slack messages—all looping in fractured syllables. You hear muffled typing from every direction, but no one else is there.

Your boss whispers, *“The deadline isn’t a time. It’s a door. You have to find the key before the door opens.”*

You glance back at the serpent-project. It has grown eyes now—glowing, patient—and it unspools itself across your monitor, displaying not code, but a reflection of your own face, aged and exhausted, repeating the words: *“You should have started earlier.”*

The clock hand snaps to 5:00 p.m.

The door in the wall swings open. Behind it is… your childhood bedroom. Your mother is calling you for dinner, but her voice is the sound of a server fan spinning up.

The serpent hisses. The boss smiles. And you realize you’re not dreaming *in* your workplace—you’re dreaming *as* your workplace. The building is you. The impossible deadline is your own pulse, counting down.

You wake up.  
Or do you?

*(Dream incomplete. You are still in it.)*
