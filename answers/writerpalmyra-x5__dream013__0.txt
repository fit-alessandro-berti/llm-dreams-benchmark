...feel the air grow cooler, the stone walls humming faintly beneath your fingertips, as if the maze itself is alive and watching. The puzzles shift—not just locks and levers, but riddles woven into the architecture: a door that only opens when you speak a truth you've never admitted, a bridge that forms only when you solve an equation whose variables are your fears and desires.

You reach a central chamber, circular and bathed in soft, silver light. In the center floats a mirror—but it reflects not your face, but moments from your past you thought you'd forgotten: a childhood notebook, a half-written letter, a melody you once hummed without knowing its name.

And then a voice, or something like one, not heard but *understood*: *"You've solved every puzzle to get here. Now solve this—why did you come?"*

The maze waits. What do you say?
