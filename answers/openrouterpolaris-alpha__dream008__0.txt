…sit down at your desk, open your laptop, and watch as nothing works.

The network is down.
Your files are gone.
The software you need doesn’t exist yet, apparently, and somehow you’re supposed to invent it.

Your boss stands over your shoulder, silent, expectant.

You click an icon—any icon—and the screen ripples like water. The cursor trails little comets of light. Lines of code begin typing themselves, flickering symbols that aren’t in any alphabet you know, resolving for half a second into something meaningful—“DON’T PANIC,” “TOO LATE,” “ALMOST”—before dissolving again.

You try to speak, to explain that this is impossible, but your voice comes out as a progress bar:

“Loading… 3%.”

The room hums. The fluorescent lights overhead elongate and bend downward, becoming skeletal white ribs. Your workplace stretches into a vast open-plan cathedral of cubicles, repeating into infinity. Every monitor in sight shows the same countdown:

DEADLINE: 00:00:10

No one moves. They simply turn their chairs, one by one, to face you. Coworkers, strangers, copies of yourself. All waiting.

You start typing frantically. Your fingers blur; more of those strange symbols appear, pouring across the screen like rain. The countdown ticks:

00:00:09
00:00:08
00:00:07

You realize, with cold clarity, that you don’t even know what the project is. There’s no brief, no notes, just the sharp smell of ozone and coffee and the awareness that every second you fail is being carefully observed.

You look up at your boss.

Their face is obscured, pixels crawling over their features like static. When they speak, it comes from every intercom, every vent, vibrating through the desk:

“You’re late.”

“I haven’t started,” you try to say, but what comes out is:

“Loading… 6%.”

00:00:06
00:00:05

You stand. Your chair shrinks to the size of a toy. Your ID badge is suddenly heavy on your chest; you look down and see the word RESPONSIBLE printed where your name should be.

The office walls fall away like elevator doors opening.

You’re not at work anymore.

You’re seated at a tiny school desk in the center of a gigantic exam hall. The impossible project has become an exam you never studied for. Rows of shadowy figures scribble confidently; your paper is blank except for the word:

EXPLAIN.

The proctor is your boss. The proctor is your parents. The proctor is everyone you’ve ever tried not to disappoint, all layered into one watching presence.

“You had all the time,” it/they say.

You flip the page, desperate. Each sheet is a scene from your life you should have lived differently—conversations cut short, ideas never started, rest you never allowed yourself—and each one has a small red stamp in the corner: LATE.

00:00:04
00:00:03

Panic surges, then… stalls.

You notice your hands. Ink-stained, trembling.

You notice the clock. It’s not on the wall anymore; it’s hovering directly in front of your eyes, blocking your view, enormous, pulsing with each heartbeat.

You take a breath.

Something simple occurs to you: this is too much.

The second you think it, the clock hesitates.

You exhale, slower this time. The hall flickers. Your boss/proctor shifts, losing focus at the edges, like a drawing smeared by a thumb.

You pick up the pen.

Instead of trying to solve the whole exam, you write three words in the middle of the page:

“I can’t know.”

The sound in the hall cuts out.

The countdown freezes:

00:00:02

Chairs vanish. The shadowy test-takers become silhouettes of cardboard, tilting and falling over soundlessly. Your boss steps forward, face still static, but the voice is smaller now, like it’s coming from another room.

“That’s not an answer.”

You circle what you wrote. Underneath, you add:

“But I can start here.”

The pen feels real, more real than anything else. As soon as the ink dries, the page ripples, and your written words spread outward, ink lines becoming hallways, doors, options. The blank exam turns into a blueprint of something not yet built—but buildable.

The deadline on the hovering clock melts, numbers dripping like wax. It collapses into an ordinary wristwatch on your arm, ticking at a human pace.

Your boss looks at your wristwatch, then at you.

The static on their face clears. It’s just a person now, slightly tired, slightly impatient, but not monstrous. They shrug.

“Fine,” they say. “Show me what you’ve got by the end of the day.”

End of the day.

Not the end of the world.

You look back at the paper-blueprint in front of you and find it’s become your computer screen at your normal desk, with a sensible list of tasks, the kind that can be done one at a time.

You feel the familiar tug of stress, but it’s smaller, like a distant radio instead of a siren.

Behind you, the infinite cathedral of cubicles is gone. It’s just your floor. A couple of coworkers laughing about something. A mug with your name on it—the real one this time.

You move the mouse. The cursor behaves.

You open a document and type the first ordinary sentence.

As you do, you become faintly aware that there was a dream, something pressing, something terrifying about a deadline that would erase you.

You can’t quite remember it now.

You just know you’ve already started.
