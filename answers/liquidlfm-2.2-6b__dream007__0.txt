take a breath—deep and deliberate—before letting the last of the fury pass. My hand lingers on a small, rusted metal locket resting on the table between us, a gift from our shared past, a silent witness to all our shared struggles. I pull the locket free and look in it—not just at the photo of us standing by a cliff some summer years ago, but at the emptiness we shared back then, the silence that had mirrored our disagreement.

Then, slowly, I reach across the table and take my friend’s hand. Not to apologize, but to say: *I’m sorry we’re hurting each other. I’m sorry I let this turn into something it didn’t have to be.* My voice is quieter now, softer, but steady.

“I still love us. Not because we agree everything, but because we try. And this… this is just one moment in the bigger story we’re writing together.”

I pause, fidgeting with the locket’s chain, watching the quiet hum of the room. Then, with a small, hopeful smile, I say: “Let’s not run from the realization that some fights are just… stepping stones. Not roadblocks.”

And out of the tension, something unexpected shifts—a pause, a shared glance, a quiet agreement that we’re willing to try again, side by side.
