...a prism floating in the air beside it. A soft, humming light emanates from the prism, splintering into a spectrum that dances across the canvas's emptiness.

Without thinking, you reach out. Your fingertips don't touch the glass, but the light itself. It feels cool and resonant, like plucking a string made of water.

At your touch, the colors on the canvas don't just appear—they *react*. A swipe of your hand through a beam of crimson leaves a trail of jagged, crystalline mountains. A gentle press into a pool of cerulean blooms into a deep, sighing ocean. Yellow becomes fields of whispering, geometric grass; violet becomes a swirling, fragrant twilight.

You realize you aren't just painting. You are *conversing* with the landscape. The dream world is offering you its raw essence—color, form, emotion—and you are giving it structure, story, and intent. A blob of anxious orange becomes a protective, warm campfire when you frame it with stones of calm grey. A smear of chaotic green sharpens into a wise, ancient forest when you trace the hint of a path through it.

You step back to look. The canvas is no longer separate from the world. It has become a new focal point, a nexus where the dream's chaos finds temporary, beautiful meaning. And as you watch, the painting begins to breathe. The mountains shift slowly, the ocean tide pulses, the grass sways in a wind you cannot feel.

You understand, then, that this is the dream's purpose: not to be deciphered, but to be co-created. The blank canvas was not an emptiness waiting for you, but a question. And your answer, painted in stolen light, is just the beginning of its reply.
