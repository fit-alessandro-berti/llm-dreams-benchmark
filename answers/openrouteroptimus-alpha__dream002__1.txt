and the wind picks up, rustling the leaves in spiraling patterns around your feet. The sunlight dims as heavy clouds roll swiftly across the sky, casting everything in a shimmering gray. You smell rain in the air, sharp and crisp, and soon fat, cold droplets begin to fall, tapping softly at first on the canopy above before quickly gathering into a gentle cascade.

You hurry for shelter and spot a hollowed-out tree trunk, its opening invitingly wide. As you duck inside, the world outside blurs with rain—each drop glowing silver in the strange, shifting light. Within the hollow tree, you find it unexpectedly warm and dry, filled with the soft scent of moss and earth. 

But as you settle in, you notice a faint glow from the far side of the trunk. Curious, you crawl closer and discover a hidden tunnel leading downward, illuminated by tiny fireflies flickering along the walls. Something calls to you—a distant melody, both comforting and unfamiliar. The storm outside rages on, but in here, a new adventure is just beginning.

Where do you go next?
