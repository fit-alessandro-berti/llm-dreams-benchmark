find food, water, and shelter. Your first task is to locate a stream or river for water. You quickly notice a babbling brook a short distance away. After satisfying your immediate thirst, you scout the area for potential food sources.

You come across a forest filled with various types of trees and bushes. You recognize some familiar edible plants like wild berries, which you cautiously pick and sample. You also spot some fruits hanging from the trees. However, you're not entirely sure if they're safe to eat, so you decide to forage some roots and leaves instead.

As the sun begins to set, you start to realize that finding a place to sleep is your next priority. You notice a large cleared area surrounded by tall grass and deadfall. You gather some dry wood, leaves, and moss to create a makeshift shelter. You use your bare hands and nearby rocks to dig a small depression in the ground, which you cover with the gathered materials to create a domed shelter.

Night falls, and you huddle inside your shelter, feeling safe but wondering about the passage of time and how you will continue to survive. As you drift off to sleep, you hear the distant sounds of nocturnal creatures, and you dream of the challenges and adventures that await you in this new era.
