In the dimly glow of the exam hall, you flip open the test booklet, heart pounding. The first question reads: *“Calculate the weight of the silence between you and your father. Show your work.”* Your pen freezes. The numbers on the page liquefy, swirling into a pool of ink that drips onto the floor, forming a puddle that reflects memories—his turned back, your unspoken apologies.  

The next question materializes: *“Argue against your own existence using three childhood regrets.”* The walls begin to sweat textbooks from elementary school, their pages peeling into origami cranes that circle overhead. One lands on your desk, unfolding to reveal a scribbled note in your mother’s handwriting: *“Why didn’t you try harder?”*  

By the third question—*“Trace the fracture lines in your happiest memory”*—the exam hall dissolves. You’re standing in your childhood home, holding a shattered snow globe. Each shard replays a birthday party, a graduation, a first kiss, all warped by what you’ve forgotten to remember.  

The clock ticks louder, now a metronome counting down to zero. A voice booms from nowhere: **“Your career is decided by what you bury, not what you write.”**  

You wake, sweaty and gasping, the taste of ink on your tongue. Outside your window, a crane takes flight, carrying a question you finally dare to answer.
