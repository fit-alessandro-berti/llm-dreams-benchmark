…nothing like what you studied. Instead of multiple-choice questions about the subject, each page is filled with strange tasks written in shimmering ink:

The first question asks you to *draw the sound of confidence*. The second tells you to *describe a memory you’ve never had*. The third is just a blank page with a single instruction: **“Listen.”**

As you lean in, the paper rustles—not from your movement, but as if it’s breathing. Faint whispers rise from the margins, forming half-sentences that dissolve before you can grasp them. Everyone around you is scribbling furiously, as if these impossible questions make perfect sense to them.

Your pulse quickens. The room feels warmer.

When you turn to the final page, you find a mirror where a question should be. Your reflection looks back at you—but it’s smiling with a confidence you don’t feel. Under the mirror is a line of text that wasn’t there a moment ago:

**“The exam is not about what you know. It’s about what you are willing to discover.”**

Your reflection gestures toward the pen in your hand, urging you forward.

What would you like to happen next?
