…find a way to communicate with the people here. The air is thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, and the buildings are low, carved from stone and timber, their roofs thatched with reeds. You're wearing rough linen clothes—too large, too old-fashioned—though you don’t remember putting them on. Your hands feel clumsy, unaccustomed to the weight of a wooden bucket you’re carrying, though you don’t know how you came to be holding it.

You stumble out of a narrow alley and into a bustling village square. Children laugh and chase each other barefoot across cobbles worn smooth by centuries. A woman with a basket of bread glares at you as you pass—her eyes sharp, suspicious. You open your mouth to speak, but the words that tumble out are not your own: a guttural, archaic dialect you’ve never spoken before. Your own voice, but twisted, unfamiliar.

Panic flares. You’re trapped not just in time, but in a body that remembers things it shouldn’t—memories of plowing fields under a pale sun, of tending goats in the morning mist. You don’t know how to farm. You don’t know where to go. But you *do* know the names of plants that grow here—names not taught in any textbook, yet you *remember* them.

Then, you see it—a small, ink-stained notebook tucked beneath a bench. You snatch it. The pages are filled with words, sketches of stars, and calculations—*your* handwriting, yet written in a hand you’ve never made. In it, you find a single phrase, scrawled in red ink: *“You are not lost. You are becoming.”*

The realization hits like a thunderclap. This isn’t just a dream. You’re not just *in* the past—you’re *becoming* it. And the way out… might not be to return, but to learn how to listen.

So you close the notebook, take a deep breath of the ancient air, and walk toward the village elder—a woman with eyes like flint and a quiet strength. You don’t know what she’ll say. But for the first time since waking, you feel certain: you’re not just surviving.

You’re remembering.
