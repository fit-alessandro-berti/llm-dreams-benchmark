You start to run, but the city won’t hold still for you. The streets tilt and loop like a spiral staircase seen from above, and every corner you turn reveals a new sky: dawn-pale pink over a river of glass, noon-bright over a canyon of neon, midnight blue where a flock of umbrellas flips in the wind. You have an hour, you tell yourself, but the clock in your chest doesn’t tick so much as shimmer and smear like a watercolor left out in the rain.

You search for a map, for a compass, for anything that can anchor you. A vending machine coughs up a folded sheet that looks suspiciously like a map of the city, but the lines rearrange themselves when you blink. A taxi driver’s face dissolves into a chorus of numbers: 9-2-5-7, 3-1-8, then nothing. Your phone is a black mirror—no signal, no reminders, only your own face staring back at you with a faint, exasperated smile.

In the square, a fountain coughs up a stream of coins that hover in the air for a moment and then clink back into the basin, as if the city doesn’t trust you with a fortune. A street musician plays a tune you almost recognize, each note a tiny door opening somewhere in the air, each doorway leading to a memory you thought you’d forgotten: the first time you gave a speech, the last time you felt certain, the moment you realized you could be wrong and still keep moving forward.

You drift toward what looks like a small cafe wedged between two skyscrapers that lean in toward each other as if to hear what you have to say. The sign flickers between “OPEN” and “CLOSED,” then settles on a warm, patient “COME IN.” Inside, the air is thick with the scent of coffee, rain, and old books. A waiter slides a menu toward you, but there’s no food—only a single line written in chalk on the napkin: Time is a place you can walk toward, not a thing that runs away from you. The ink wears away as you read it, leaving behind a feeling more than a fact.

You try to ask the waiter about the meeting, but your voice splits into echoes that bounce off the ceiling like birds made of sound. The city outside continues to rearrange itself—the rain begins to fall upward, the pigeons march in neat ranks, the traffic lights switch from red to green to the color of a memory you can’t quite touch. You realize the meeting might not be at a particular building or room; it might be with a version of yourself who knows you better than you know yourself right now.

A girl with a backpack the size of a small ship sits across from you, studying you with curious gravity. “You look for a place, but you’re really looking for a decision,” she says, as if quoting a line from a book she never finished. “The city hands you doors, yes, but they only open when you’re ready to walk through them with what you’ve learned.” She pulls out a tiny hourglass from her pocket and flips it gently; the sand flows upward, defying gravity, then settles again in reverse.

Outside, a door in the wall slides open to reveal a corridor that spirals upward in a perfect staircase, each step carved with a word: Courage, Curiosity, Patience, Surrender, Trust. As you ascend, the city’s clamor softens into a murmur, then into a whisper that sounds suspiciously like your own name being called in a language you don’t quite recognize. The staircase ends in a room that isn’t a room: a balcony that looks out over a city made of quiet rain and sharp sunlight, a horizon that folds in on itself like a map being drawn by a child.

In the middle of the balcony sits a single chair facing outward toward a skyline that seems to hold its breath. A man who could be you—your closest friend, your oldest mentor, or perhaps the you you’ll become—steps forward and sits in the chair across from you without a word. The meeting, you suddenly understand, is not with a place but with a choice you’ve been avoiding. The choice is this: to trust a path you can’t see, or to demand a path you can measure.

“Time isn’t running you,” the other you says, voice warm and a little amused. “You’ve been running toward certainty, when certainty is a moving target. You’re fine as you are; you just need to walk toward what feels true, not what’s easy to remember.” He (or she) gestures toward a door that is not there until you look at it directly, then becomes unmistakable. It reads simply: Here.

You stand, and the city’s ordinary physics slip away just enough to let you slip through that door with a breath you didn’t realize you were holding. The corridor beyond is a tunnel of becoming rather than a tunnel of distance. Each step you take hums with possibility, as if the floor remembers every choice you could have made and forgives the ones you’ve chosen anyway.

You glimpse the path you were supposed to take for the meeting: not a street address, not a conference room, but a moment when you say what you need to say and hear what you need to hear. A voice you trust tells you the last words you’ll need to hear before you wake: You’ve already prepared for this more than you know. Trust your sense of now.

The dream begins to loosen its grip as you near the end. The corridor widens into a doorway you step through back into the city’s familiar-but-not-quite-so-wild version. The hour is still there, but it feels less like a countdown and more like a gentle nudge. You find yourself at a street corner you somehow recognize—not from memory, but from decision. A busker with a violin offers you a bow, and as you take it, the city seems to lean in, listening.

And then you wake, breath quick, heart steady, the edges of the dream clinging to your skin like rain on a window. The meeting you feared you’d miss is suddenly secondary to the knowledge you carry: you don’t need to chase certainty to be ready; you only need to walk toward what feels true, one honest step at a time. The note in your pocket—an echo of the dream, perhaps—reminds you: your next move is the one that feels right in this moment.
