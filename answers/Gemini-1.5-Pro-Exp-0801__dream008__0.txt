...stare blankly at the project brief, the words blurring into a nonsensical jumble. My stomach churns, a cold sweat prickling my skin. The deadline glares back at me, a mocking red stamp on the page â€“ tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning! It's practically already tomorrow!
My boss, a towering figure with eyes that seem to pierce through me, taps his foot impatiently. The rhythmic thudding echoes the frantic hammering of my heart. Each tap feels like a nail hammered into the coffin of my sanity.
I want to scream, to throw the project brief in the air and declare the whole thing ludicrous. But my voice catches in my throat, a strangled gasp trapped behind a forced smile. My legs feel like lead, rooted to the spot.
Suddenly, the fluorescent lights above begin to flicker, casting the room in a strobe-like effect. My boss's face distorts, his features stretching and morphing into something grotesque. His tapping foot transforms into a gigantic chicken leg, scratching at the linoleum floor.
A wave of dizziness washes over me. This can't be real. It's just a dream, right?
I close my eyes, take a deep breath, and try to wake up. But when I open them again, I'm still in the office, the flickering lights casting an eerie glow on the chicken-legged monstrosity that was once my boss.
He clucks impatiently, a bead of drool dripping from his beak-like mouth. "Well? Are you going to get started?" he squawks, his voice a raspy cackle.
And that's when I realize - this isn't just any impossible deadline. This is a nightmare. A bureaucratic, poultry-infused nightmare from which there is no escape. I let out a defeated sigh and reach for a pen, knowing that even in my dreams, there's no escaping the tyranny of work.
Maybe if I finish this project, the chicken-legged boss will finally lay a golden egg and let me wake up.
Or maybe, just maybe, I'll discover I've been a chicken all along.
