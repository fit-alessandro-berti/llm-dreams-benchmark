You start to pat your pockets, certain that a folded map or an invitation or at least a clue will crinkle back at you. Your hands come up with strange currencies: a subway token the size of your palm, a key in the shape of a question mark, a receipt that lists only the words “bread, patience, thunder.” No address. No map. Your phone lights when you think of it, then droops like a soft fruit in your palm and resolves into a small blackbird with a glassy eye. It tilts its head and whispers: Your next event is in one hour. Location: Where you were going.

The city breathes around you, exhaling heat and old music. Towers slide together like books on a shelf. The streets are long belts of asphalt that tug you forward. You pick one and begin to walk, then to hurry, then to run, but your legs keep using the wrong verbs, and your running becomes gliding, your gliding a slow float, as if the air has turned to warm milk.

You stop a woman whose hair is made of fine wire and ask about the meeting. She points with her whole body, not her hand, toward a street that smells like oranges. Turn left at the smell of bread, she tells you. Go straight until the light becomes forgiving. If you reach the place where the pigeons queue politely at a vending machine, you’ve gone too far.

Someone has graffitied the sky. Letters drift on the clouds, rearranging: LATE, LATER, LATTE. You pass a café where the sign says We Make Time and inside people are sipping steaming clocks, blowing carefully on the long hands. You consider buying an espresso shot of five minutes, but the line snakes into last week.

A bus rolls up, vast and purring, its destination sign flickering: SOON. The driver wears a tie printed with constellations and a hat that makes him look like a serious wolf. He nods at the blackbird perched on your wrist. The bird nods back. The doors sigh and you climb aboard. Inside, there are living rooms where seats should be. A couch from your grandmother’s house. A rug you remember spilling juice on. People who might be you, at different draughts, hold onto the straps and sway.

You pull the cord and the bus lets you off beneath a clock tower. The clock face sags a little at the edges. The numbers wander. At the four there is a small meadow. At the eleven, a window you can look into and see last Tuesday. You look at your wrist for the time and find a thin ring of skin glowing faintly. The blackbird ticks three times, like a polite cough. Fifty-seven minutes.

Street names don’t help. Courage Avenue meets Maybe Lane. The sign for Future Street points in every direction. A kiosk stands under a tree, run by a man whose beard is braided with bits of ribbon. Minutes, he tells you before you ask. Ten for a handful, thirty for a little box. You ask for sixty and he laughs. No one buys an hour, he says. You take a packet anyway; it crinkles like candy. In your mouth the minutes taste like lemon and rain. The city around you sharpens slightly, then softens, then is exactly as it was.

You follow the woman’s directions. The smell of bread is a tide you wade through. At a corner it breaks against a procession of people carrying ladders sideways. Above you, there’s a balcony where someone plays a piano with no keys, their fingers moving decisively through silence. A plaza opens and closes like a heartbeat. In the center, a fountain gurgles with a liquid that mirrors nothing.

You ask a man with a briefcase shaped like a house. He opens it and inside there is a little room with two chairs and a fern and a nameplate that reads Everyone. He sighs. Third door on your right, he says. You look around. There are only two doors. You pick the one that is sulking and it becomes an elevator as you approach, throat of brushed steel. Inside, the panel of buttons offers you: Basement, Expectation, Regret, Conference. You press Conference and, because you are dreaming, you also press Expectation. The elevator hums, then opens to the ocean.

Chairs float there, tethered by silky ropes to the horizon. You wade in, shoes filling with messages. You sit. A paper name tag drifts by with your handwriting on it, miraculously waterproof. Around you, other chairs bob, occupied by versions of you who made different wrong turns: one with paint on their hands, one in a uniform you have never seen, one holding a sleeping child. They nod as if to say, Yes, yes, it was always here.

But it isn’t here. As soon as you reach for anyone, the ocean yawns into a hallway, long and carpeted and smelling like pencils. You step out dripping. The carpet becomes turf, then tile, then the blue of an airport at 3 a.m. Rows of gates stretch away. The departures board lists destinations like Appointment, Opportunity, Answer, Apology. Your gate says Origin. Your boarding time is Now.

You run. Your running is better now, more verb-appropriate. People blur into useful smudges. At Gate Origin a woman with the face of a clock tears a ticket you don’t remember into two halves and gives you both. Not yet, she says kindly, because that is what time always says to you.

You find yourself in front of a building that you have always known and never seen. It is made of staircases folding in on themselves like a nautilus. Each step has something handwritten on it: the grocery list, the day you learned to whistle, the joke you didn’t get until later. A doorman whose coat is the exact color of midnight looks you up and down and says your name the way people who knew you before you were named say it. He gestures at your pockets. You empty them. Out come the token, the key, the receipt, the packet of minutes with lemon still on your tongue. He shakes his head, not unkindly. The map, he says.

You look down. You are holding your map. When did you get it? It looks like a piece of the city skinned and folded, creases bright as rivers. It shows a dotted line from here to here, from your feet to your chest. Location: Where you started.

You fold the map until it is small enough to slip under your tongue. The doorman smiles and the door opens, not onto a lobby but onto a small, simple room: a table, two chairs, a window that is also a mirror. The city’s noise is a muffled ocean outside. The clock-woman sits across from you, and also it is your mother, and also it is last winter, and also the woman with wire hair, and also the blackbird you forgot you were holding. Something in you feels a little bit like relief, a little bit like grief, a little bit like locking a bicycle to a lamppost and walking away because you know it will be there when you come back.

You are exactly on time. You always were. The agenda is a single item: Arrival. Minutes will be taken by rain. Someone taps a glass with a fork, and the room hushes, and you remember the address you were trying to remember: it is the name of the first street you ever walked down. It is your own mouth forming the word Here.
