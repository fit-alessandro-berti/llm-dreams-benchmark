**The Dream Continues:**

You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world where the sky is a bruised twilight—ashes and rusted metal cling to the horizon like a forgotten nightmare. The air smells of ozone and damp earth, thick with the scent of decaying crops and the distant, guttural growls of something that wasn’t meant to be alive. The streets are littered with the skeletal remains of the old world: shattered glass, rusted cars, and the occasional flicker of a dying neon sign that once advertised something now forgotten.

You move through the ruins with the quiet confidence of someone who has learned to read the world through its cracks. The people you pass—if you can call them that—are a mix of scavengers, survivors, and those who cling to the last remnants of civilization. Some wear the faded patches of old uniforms, others the rags of the desperate. A few carry the weight of something heavier than just survival: the ghosts of what they lost.

Then you see it—a flicker of movement in the shadows of a collapsed building. A child, no older than eight, is crouched over a half-buried crate, fingers brushing against something metallic. Their eyes are wide with wonder, not fear. You approach slowly, and they look up, their face streaked with dirt and tears.

*"They say the old machines still work,"* the child whispers, voice trembling. *"But they don’t work for us anymore."*

You kneel beside them. The crate is half-full of rusted tools, a few half-dead plants clinging to the sides, and something else—something that looks like a small, broken radio. The child’s hands tremble as they press it to their ear. A static hiss fills the air, then a voice, faint but clear:

*"This is the last transmission. Repeat: the last transmission. The world ended because we didn’t listen."*

The child’s breath catches. *"Who’s talking?"*

You don’t know. But the words linger in the air like a warning, like a promise. The child looks at you, then back at the radio. *"Do you think they’re still out there?"*

You don’t answer. Instead, you reach into your own pocket—a small, tarnished key, its surface worn smooth by years of use. *"Maybe,"* you say softly. *"Maybe we’re not the only ones who remember."*

The child’s eyes narrow. *"Then why don’t you use it?"*

You hesitate. The key is old, its lock long since broken. But the child’s gaze is desperate, and for the first time, you wonder if the world isn’t just a graveyard—if it’s also a place where hope, buried deep, might still wake.

As the child reaches for the key, the radio crackles again, this time with a sound that makes your skin prickle. A voice, distorted but unmistakable:

*"They’re coming."*

The child’s face pales. *"Who?"*

You don’t know. But the answer isn’t far away.

And then—silence.

The dream fades as you wake, your hands still clutching the key, your mind racing with questions. Was it a warning? A threat? Or just another fragment of a world that refused to die?

The ruins are still there. The child is gone. And the radio’s voice lingers in your dreams, whispering secrets from the edges of the apocalypse.
