You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the sky darkens to an unnatural bruised purple. Thunder cracks like shattering glass, and the first fat raindrops splatter on the leaves, heavy as coins. Winds howl through the canopy, bending ancient oaks like reeds, and you stumble forward, heart pounding, seeking shelter.

Lightning forks overhead, illuminating a hidden glade ahead—a circle of glowing mushrooms pulsing with ethereal blue light. You duck under a massive fallen log as the downpour unleashes, turning the path into a roaring river. But then, from the shadows of the glade, a figure emerges: a stag with antlers woven from living vines and eyes like swirling galaxies. It doesn't flee the storm; it stands defiant, and as it locks eyes with you, the chaos quiets. The rain slows to a mist, the winds whisper secrets, and the stag bows its head, inviting you closer.

You step into the glade, the mushrooms' glow warming your skin. The stag speaks—not in words, but in visions flooding your mind: forgotten memories of flying through starlit skies, diving into ocean depths with whales, and reshaping mountains with a thought. The storm was no threat; it was a gateway. Awakening power stirs within you—your hands tingle with green fire, roots twisting up from the earth at your command.

But as dawn's first light pierces the clouds, the stag dissolves into fireflies, swirling around you in a joyful dance. The forest sighs, peaceful once more, and you realize: this was no ordinary dream. You carry its magic back into waking life, forever changed.
