As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and each one seems to pull you into their orbit, like magnets in a surreal dreamscape. First, there's a cluster of laughing artists, their faces painted in swirling colors that shift like oil on water; they hand you a brush and insist you join their mural on the wall, which morphs into a living forest that whispers secrets about forgotten memories. You politely excuse yourself, heart racing, only to stumble into a circle of musicians whose instruments are made of glowing vines and feathers—they play a melody that makes the room spin, and suddenly you're dancing on a cloud, your feet barely touching the ground.

Pushing onward, you weave through a group of philosophers debating the nature of dreams within the dream, their words twisting into riddles that make your head ache: "If you seek one, do you not find yourself?" You nod vaguely and slip away, but now the crowd thickens with shadowy figures in elaborate masks, hosting a masquerade where everyone swaps identities— for a moment, you wear a crown of stars and become a queen of forgotten constellations, commanding the stars to align and reveal your friend's location.

Finally, as the party's edges blur into a starry void, you spot them across the room, waving from atop a floating staircase made of books. But just as you reach out, the dream fractures: the gathering dissolves into a cascade of autumn leaves, and you wake with the echo of laughter in your ears, wondering if it was all a glimpse of another reality.
