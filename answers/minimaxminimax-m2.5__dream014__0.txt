# The Dream Continues

You accept their guidance, and they lead you through winding alleyways and bright storefronts. Their laughter is gentle as they share stories of the city—its hidden gardens, its midnight bakeries, its secret passages known only to locals.

One stranger, an older woman with silver hair, presses a small origami crane into your palm. "For when you feel lost again," she whispers.

The city begins to shift around you. The streets grow quieter, softer, as if the buildings themselves are listening. The strangers stop at a small plaza where a fountain glows with warm amber light.

"This is where we leave you," says a young man with kind eyes. "The path home is through the door that isn't there—until you believe it is."

You look around, confused, and then you see it: a doorway shimmering in the air, floating between two ancient brick walls. Through it, you glimpse a familiar room, a warm bed, the soft glow of morning light creeping through curtains.

You turn to thank the strangers, but they're gone. Only the origami crane remains in your hand, still warm.

You step through the doorway—

And wake up.
