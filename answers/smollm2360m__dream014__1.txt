I'm utterly bewildered by all these people walking around at once as if they were ants! And this towering skyscraper building seems to be calling my name, yet I don't hear its creaking. The hustle and bustle of the city is so overwhelming that it's like the earth itself is shaking a bit in awe of human creativity but then somehow calming down afterwards with more noise pollution. It's also confusing how one person could speak so many different languages – even though everyone looks exactly like any other, I still don't get it. The fact that everything around me seems to be so busy and full of life is almost terrifying at times yet at the same it feels thrilling like a never-ending adventure in love or excitement... Oh my... Where can I find this beautiful city? Can someone please help me?!
