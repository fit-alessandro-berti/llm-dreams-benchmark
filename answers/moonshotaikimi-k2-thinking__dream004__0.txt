and as I reach out to touch it, my fingers sink through the surface like water. The canvas isn't empty들t's *waiting*. Behind it, I can feel the texture of things that haven't been imagined yet, a humming void of pure potential.

I pull my hand back, and colors begin bleeding from my fingertips. Not paint, but raw chromatic essence that congeals into impossible hues: red that sings, blue that tastes of copper, a yellow that folds in on itself like origami. They pool on the canvas not as images, but as *events*드 sunset that hasn't happened, a memory that belongs to someone I've never met, the precise sound of a key turning in a lock to a room that doesn't exist.

The shapes around me, which had been fluid clouds becoming architecture becoming waves, suddenly freeze. They turn toward the canvas, as if I've called them to attention. One shape드 spiral that was just a moment ago a mountain듟etaches from the landscape and drifts into the painting. It dissolves into a single line that begins to move *behind* the canvas, in a direction I can't point to.

I realize the canvas isn't for me to paint on. It's a mouth, and I've just fed it.

The colors intensify, and now I can see through the canvas to the other side. There, the world is stable. Fixed. Objects hold their form for more than a heartbeat. I see myself standing still, looking back at me through the frame. My other self raises a hand in greeting, but the gesture is wrong듯nnatural in its permanence.

Behind me, the fluid world shudders. A voice that is also the sound of glass cracking whispers: "You were never supposed to find a mirror."

I turn back to the landscape, but it's already forgetting me, its colors shifting into shapes that have no name. The canvas, solid now, floats away like a leaf on a wind I can't feel. I try to remember what color my hands were before I touched it, but the memory keeps changing.
