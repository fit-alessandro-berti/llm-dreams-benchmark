...frantically check your pockets. Your phone is gone. Your wallet is gone. Instead, your right pocket is full of smooth, warm river stones, and your left contains a single, impossibly heavy pocket watch that has no hands. Its face is a swirling nebula of deep purple and gold.

The city hums around you, a low, choral frequency that seems to emanate from the very buildings themselves. They are towers of polished obsidian and brass, spiraling into a sky the color of a bruised peach where two slow-moving suns hang. The people hurrying past aren't quite people; their faces are smooth, featureless masks of porcelain, and they glide rather than walk, their movements synchronized like a silent ballet. You try to stop one, to ask for help, but your hand passes right through them as if they are smoke.

Panic begins to bubble in your throat. The meeting. It feels more important than life itself, a convergence point for your entire existence. You can't remember what it's about, or who it's with, only that to miss it would be to unravel completely.

You look for a street sign, a landmark, anything. You spot one, a glowing plaque on the side of a brass tower. But the letters are a flowing, bioluminescent script that shifts and reforms as you try to read it, like a school of silver fish. It’s beautiful, and utterly useless.

Suddenly, a sound cuts through the city's hum: the clear, solitary call of a bell. It rings from a narrow alleyway you hadn't noticed before, tucked between two humming towers. The alley is dark, but the bell's sound is a physical pull, a rope hauling you in.

You plunge into the darkness. The grand obsidian and brass give way to crumbling brickwork covered in phosphorescent moss that casts a soft, green glow. The alley twists and turns, a labyrinth that feels both endless and claustrophobic. The air grows cool and smells of damp earth and rain. The bell rings again, closer this time.

Finally, the alley opens up, not onto another street, but into a small, circular courtyard containing a single, enormous weeping willow tree. Its branches, heavy with silver leaves, trail all the way to the ground, forming a shimmering curtain. The bell is hanging from one of its branches, swaying gently in a nonexistent breeze.

Beneath the tree sits a small, old woman, weaving the silver leaves into a long braid. Her face is a map of wrinkles, but her eyes are bright and young, the same color as the nebula in your pocket watch.

She looks up at you as if she's been waiting. "You're cutting it a bit close," she says, her voice like the rustling of the leaves themselves.

"My meeting," you stammer, relieved to finally speak to someone solid. "I don't know where it is."

She smiles, a slow, knowing smile. She stops weaving and pats the ground beside her. "The first step to arriving," she says softly, "is to stop running."

You hesitate, the feeling of urgency still screaming inside you. But her calm is infectious. You sink to the ground beside her. She hands you the end of the silver braid she's been weaving.

"Just hold this," she instructs.

You take it. The moment your fingers touch the cool, metallic leaves, the pocket watch in your pocket begins to tick, a slow, steady, powerful beat. The hum of the city fades away, replaced by the rhythmic ticking that now seems to be coming from your own heart.

The old woman nods. "There now. The meeting is about to begin."

You look around the courtyard, at the silver tree and the mossy walls. "But... where is it?"

She points a gnarled finger at your own reflection, staring back at you from the polished surface of the bell. Your face looks calm, your eyes clear.

And you understand. The panic dissolves like sugar in water. You were never late. You were simply on your way. You settle in, listening to the ticking of your heart, ready for the meeting to start.
