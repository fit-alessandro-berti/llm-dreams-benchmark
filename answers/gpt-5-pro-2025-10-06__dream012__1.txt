…plant your palm on the wheel. The wood is slick and alive under your hand, the ship shuddering like a huge animal that wants to bolt. Rain comes at you sideways. The horizon is gone—just a heaving wall of gray on all sides—so your crew watches your face the way sailors watch a lighthouse.

“Reef the main. Storm jib only,” you say, and your voice carries, clean as a bell. The orders run down the deck faster than the water: hands on halyards, boots thudding, canvas snarling as it comes down to a hard, narrow bite. The bow slews. You tap the wheel, bringing her back until the seas are a shoulder instead of a fist. You don’t know how you know this, but your body does, the way a throat knows how to swallow.

Lightning shows you, for a breath, the crew’s faces: your first mate, who is also your oldest friend; the cook, who is also a teacher you disappointed; a deckhand, who is also a stranger you promised to call back and never did. Dream logic reshuffles them each time you blink. They look to you, not for weather, but for a decision you have been postponing even on land.

The compass on the binnacle spins, then settles, then becomes a pocket watch, then a ring on someone’s finger. Time skitters. You steady it with the heel of your hand until the needle remembers North.

“Batten the hatches. Lash the longboat. Keep her at forty-five,” you say, and the helmsman nods before you realize the helmsman is you, which makes sense because it’s your dream and your storm and your hands. The deck bucks; a wave hits broadside and the ship grinds, then lifts, stubborn and faithful. You feel an old fear rise—thin, talking quickly—telling you to run with the wind and let the storm chase you. The fear makes good points. It always does.

You breathe and listen past it. The rigging sings three notes, over and over, the way a kettle does just before the boil. You taste salt. It could be the sea. It could be the word you’ve been holding on your tongue.

“Easy,” you tell the ship. “Easy.” You do not mean the planks.

The sea grows personal when you speak to it. The waves become sentences you can nearly read. Some end with question marks. One of them puts its shoulder under your keel and, for a moment, the whole vessel is lifted high enough that you can see down into the valley on the other side—a bruise-colored road of water arrowing toward a far-off brightness. It’s as if the storm has sides, and the far side is morning.

A coil of rope smacks your leg. You stoop to throw it aside and find it isn’t rope at all, but a thought you’ve kept coiled next to the mast for years: the one about how other captains are braver, more certain, always pointing straight into what matters without losing their grip. You try to toss it clear. It comes back around your ankle. “Not now,” you tell it. “We’re working.”

You get practical. You set three short goals because you learned to, somewhere: hold the angle, count eight breaths, speak one simple sentence. You choose this one: “We ride it.”

When you say it, the crew says it with you. You hadn’t known they were listening for the exact phrasing. The words go down the deck like an extra brace. The bow punches into another wave and a wall of water slams over the rail, but now the hit feels like weather, not judgment. Weather is a thing that happens. Judgment is a thing you do to yourself in the quiet, and even here—especially here—the quiet is in short supply.

The sky tears and stitches. In a flash you see shape in the clouds, a chart you almost remember from a lesson you almost passed. You put your hand on the wheel again and find it’s warm. The warmth is ridiculous and ordinary and saves you from thinking too much. You keep her quartering the swell, and the ship, relieved to be told one clear way to go, obeys.

Minutes or hours—dream time is practical only when it wants to be—pile up. The wind drops half a note. The rain shifts from punishment to rinse. The deck stops trying to throw you and settles for grumbling about it. Someone laughs, a short, shocked bark, and it spreads. A crew that laughs while working is a crew that thinks you brought them through. You accept the credit because you also accept the storm, and acceptance is roofing: it keeps the worst of it off your head.

You look at the compass again. It has turned back into a compass. North is an idea you can live with. The watch on your wrist shows no numbers—only a slow pulse that matches the beat in your throat. You count to eight and it takes one long second or a year. Either way, you arrive.

On the far side of the squall the sea is still the same sea, but it looks newly washed, as if someone wiped its mouth. The crew stands there steaming lightly in their slickers, smaller somehow and more human, and you love them for asking you to be the one who chose.

Only then do you notice the cargo you jettisoned. It isn’t crates; it’s sentences: I should have known by now. I should never have tried. I should be further along. They bob behind you like dark buoys and then, one by one, the waves take them. You think to mourn them, and then you don’t.

“Make sail,” you say. “We’ll take what wind there is.”

Canvas blooms, a sudden patient flower. The ship leans into it, eager. Your first mate—your friend—comes to stand by the wheel. Their face is just their face again. “Where to, Captain?” they ask, and you realize the map has been in your pocket the whole time. It’s blank except for a single sentence written in a hand you recognize as your own: Aim for the kindest horizon you can name.

You look up. There are openings in the sky. Light falls through like a promise that does not have to be kept to be real. You give the wheel a small turn, nothing dramatic, the kind of turn that makes sense and keeps making sense for miles. The ship responds. So do you.

And because this is a dream, the storm keeps a piece of you, and you keep a piece of the storm. That feels fair. The sea evens out to a long, workable roll. The crew begins to do the quiet work that says danger has passed and living resumes. You taste salt again and recognize it at last: not the ocean, but your own breath.

“Steady,” you say.

And you are.
