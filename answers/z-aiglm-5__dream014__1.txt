...and you hesitate for a moment, the cold gray of the sidewalk seeming to seep into your shoes. But their smiles are warm, cutting through the urban smog like sunlight through a prism. You reach out and take the hand of the nearest stranger—a woman with eyes that shimmer like polished slate.

The moment your fingers touch, the roar of the traffic instantly silences, replaced by a low, melodic hum, like the sound of a finger tracing the rim of a crystal glass. The group guides you forward, but you realize you aren't walking on the pavement anymore. The asphalt has softened, turning into springy, emerald moss that cushions your steps.

The skyscrapers around you begin to sway gently, their rigid steel lines blurring and bending like willow trees in a breeze. As the strangers lead you around a corner, the street opens up not onto another avenue, but into a vast, impossible clearing. The sky above is a swirling canvas of violet and deep indigo, and the stars are drifting down slowly like snowflakes, dissolving into the moss at your feet.

One of the strangers points upward. You look up to see that the city hasn't vanished; it has turned transparent. You can see the people walking on the floors above you, glowing softly like lanterns, moving in a slow, graceful dance. The feeling of being lost evaporates, replaced by a profound sense of weightlessness. You realize you aren't trying to find a street address anymore; you are simply drifting through the luminous architecture of your own mind, safe in the company of these radiant guides.
