*fingers trace the cool metal surface*

...intricate patterns and symbols that seem to shift when I'm not looking directly at them. Spirals becoming letters becoming faces becoming spirals again.

I realize the patterns are responding to my touch—warming beneath my fingertips, rearranging themselves like living things. The box wants something from me.

I press my palm flat against the lid and suddenly understand: the lock doesn't need a key. It needs a *memory*.

I think of the first time I felt genuinely curious about something, and the box hums. The patterns flow toward my hand like iron filings to a magnet, forming a shape I almost recognize—

*click*

The lid opens slowly, releasing the scent of old libraries and approaching rain. Inside, resting on velvet the color of deep water, is...

A small mirror. But my reflection is wrong—it's showing me not as I am, but as I *could be*. Dozens of possible versions flickering like a shuffled deck of cards.

One version reaches through the glass and hands me something small and warm.

I look down at my palm.

It's a seed that pulses with faint light, and I know with dream-certainty that whatever I plant it in—a conversation, a question, an idea—it will grow into something I've never seen before.

*I close my fingers around it*

What should I do with it?
