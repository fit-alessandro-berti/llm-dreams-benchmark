# The Seed

Despite the hardships, you decide to carry the seed.

It sits in your palm—small, brown, unassuming. An oak, maybe. Or something else entirely. You found it three days ago in the ruins of a greenhouse, tucked inside a mason jar labeled *Hope* in faded sharpie. You thought that was either very stupid or very brave.

Maybe both.

You pack it in your final can of beans, padding it with a scrap of wool. The seed is more valuable than the food. The food keeps *you* alive. The seed might keep *something* alive after you're gone.

The city behind you burns at night. You don't look back.

You walk until your boots split. Until the ash gives way to scrubland and the scrubland yields to something that might become forest, given fifty years. You won't see it. That's not the point.

*Put it somewhere the water finds*, the journal in your pack reads. You found those pages in a dead woman's pocket. She'd drawn maps. Circled places in red ink. Most were too far. One was close.

A valley. A spring. A chance.

---

On day seven, the dog finds you.

Matted fur. Ribs like a ladder. She stands at a distance, watching. You offer nothing. She follows anyway. By nightfall, she's pressed against your back for warmth. You name her *Later* because she's something you'll deal with.

Later.

---

The valley is real.

You find it on day twelve, when your water's been gone for a day and a half and Later has stopped walking. You carry her the last mile, and when you smell wet earth, you nearly weep.

The spring is small. A seep from the rock, pooling in a depression lined with stone. Nothing grows here yet. The soil is thin and gray. But the water is clean. You know because Later drinks before you can stop her, and she doesn't die.

You dig with your hands. The hole is small. The seed goes in. You cover it gently. Water it from your palms.

Then you sit back on your heels and wait for absolutely nothing to happen.

---

You don't expect to be here long.

But the days stack up. You build a shelter from fallen branches and sheet metal dragged from a wreck two miles south. You rig a catchment for rain. Later kills a rabbit on day twenty, and you cook it over a fire so small it barely smokes, eating with your fingers, crying for reasons you can't name.

The seed doesn't sprout.

You talk to it anyway.

*I don't know if you're still alive in there*, you tell the dirt. *I don't know if I am either.*

---

On day forty-one, you wake to Later growling.

Two figures stand at the edge of your camp. A woman. A child. Sunburned. Starving. Armed with a kitchen knife and a length of pipe.

You could reach for your rifle. You don't.

Instead, you hold up both hands—empty, open—and point to the pot by the fire. Rabbit stew. Thin, but warm.

They eat like it hurts.

---

By autumn, there are eleven of you.

The seed has become a seedling—four inches high, trembling in the wind. You've built a windbreak around it. The children take turns watering it. They named it *Tomorrow*, which is better than anything you would've chosen.

At night, you sit by the fire and listen to the others talk. About where they've been. What they've lost. What they're building. Someone's planted a garden. Someone else is rigging a water wheel.

You don't tell them about the journal, the dead woman, the mason jar.

But sometimes, when the fire burns low and Later sighs in her sleep, you touch the packet of seeds hidden in your coat pocket. Twelve more. Different kinds. Found in the same greenhouse.

You won't plant them all here. That's not the point.

---

You dream of walking again.

Of finding another valley. Another spring. Of leaving small green legacies scattered across the wasted world. Stupid, maybe. Brave, probably.

But when the frost comes and Tomorrow drops its last leaf, clinging to life through the long cold season, you know what you'll do come spring.

You'll keep going.

*There's more work now*, the woman says one night, watching you stare at the dark horizon. *More people. More to lose.*

*I know*, you say.

*So why leave?*

You think about it. The fire crackles. Later's ears twitch in her sleep.

*Because I can*, you say.

And because someone has to.

---

When the snows melt, you pack your bag. You take six seeds. You leave six for the valley. The woman watches you go, the child on her hip, Tomorrow stirring in the thaw behind them.

Later rises, stretches, follows.

You don't look back.

There's a spring to the north. Another valley. More dead earth waiting for something small and brown and impossibly hopeful.

You walk.
