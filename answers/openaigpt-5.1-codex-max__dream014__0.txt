...thank them with a rush of relief you didn't know you were holding. You fall into step behind them, weaving through the tide of bodies and blaring horns. Their voices are soft over the din, somehow always in your ear, always in a language you understand. One of them, a woman with silver hair and eyes the color of streetlights in the rain, takes your hand, and it is warm.

They lead you down a side street you swear wasn't there a moment ago. The noise fades. The skyscrapers lean back to let the sky breathe. A narrow staircase spirals up the side of an old brick building, ivy cascading down like a green waterfall. You climb, your legs light, as if gravity has lost its grip.

At the top, there is a rooftop garden suspended above the chaos. Lanterns bob in the air like jellyfish. Tables are set with food that tastes like memory—warm bread, soup like your grandmother's, sweet fruit that drips summer down your chin. You sit. You laugh. For the first time all day, you hear your own voice and it sounds like music.

One of the strangers unfurls a map across the table. It isn't ink on paper but light on skin, glowing lines that shift and pulse. The city is there, but so are rivers you've never crossed, forests where buildings used to stand, a path that is less a route than a feeling. As you lean in, you see your own heart at the center, beating steadily, and every street radiates out from it.

"You've always known the way," the man with the lanterns for eyes whispers. "You just needed someone to walk with you until you remembered."

You trace the luminous path with your finger and feel warmth spread through your chest. When you look up, the strangers are no longer strangers. One has your father's smile, another your childhood friend's dimple, another your reflection. They all nod, and slowly, one by one, they dissolve into the city lights, leaving the map glowing on your palm.

You step back to the edge of the rooftop. The city below is still a maze, still alive and loud, but now you can see the pattern. There is no fear, no ache of loneliness. You know which way to go, not because someone told you, but because the direction feels like home.

As you take the first step down, the dream softens and the rooftops become sheets and the lanterns become morning light through your window. You wake with the warmth of a hand still in yours, and the echo of that whisper in your ears: you've always known the way.
