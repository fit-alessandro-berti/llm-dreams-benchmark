and the environment itself begins to shift. The party is in a grand, old mansion, but as you push past a group of chatterers, the hallway stretches impossibly long, lined not with doors, but with heavy velvet curtains.

You pull one aside and step through, hoping it leads to a quiet room where your friend might be waiting. Instead, you find yourself on a cobblestone street under a bruised purple sky. It’s night, but the streetlamps flicker with a pale, watery light. The "groups of people" are no longer just chatting; they are engaged in strange, silent rituals. One group stands in a circle around a floating sphere of water, chanting a melody that sounds like wind chimes. Another group is playing chess on a board where the pieces are tiny, sleeping birds.

You weave through them, feeling their eyes on you but never quite meeting their gaze. You start to worry that the friend you’re looking for might have been absorbed into one of these groups, transformed into a pawn or a note in the wind. The anxiety sharpens, making the dream more vivid. You see a flash of a familiar red scarf ahead, disappearing around a corner. You run, but the cobblestone turns into a soft, sponchy moss, and your feet sink with every step. The air smells of ozone and old books. Just as you spot the red scarf again, hanging from a lamppost with no owner, the lamppost blooms with white roses. You reach out to touch the scarf—

And you wake up.
