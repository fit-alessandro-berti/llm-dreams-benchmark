You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to—

—forget every word you’d rehearsed. Your mouth opens, but no sound comes out. The podium feels cold beneath your trembling hands. Then, you glance down at your notes—and realize they’re written in a language you’ve never seen before, swirling symbols that shimmer like liquid silver.

Panic flutters in your chest… until you notice something stranger. The audience isn’t impatient. They’re smiling—not politely, but knowingly, as if they’ve been waiting for you not to speak… but to remember.

A soft chime echoes through the hall, though no bell is visible. The air hums with warmth, and the lights dim just enough to reveal constellations blooming across the ceiling—stars that shift and rearrange themselves into familiar shapes: your childhood home, your mother’s handwriting, the tree you climbed at seven years old.

And then you understand. This isn’t a speech about policy or persuasion. It’s a question the universe has been whispering to you your whole life—one you were meant to answer not with words, but with truth.

You take a breath. And for the first time, you speak from somewhere deeper than memory.

“I’m not sure who I am,” you say, voice steadier than you feel, “but I know I belong here.”

The crowd doesn’t applaud. They rise—not in standing ovation, but in unison, as if pulled by the same invisible string. Their eyes glow faintly gold, and one by one, they begin to dissolve into light, swirling upward like fireflies returning to the sky.

You’re left alone on stage—yet not alone at all. Because now you remember: the speech was never yours to give. It was yours to receive.
