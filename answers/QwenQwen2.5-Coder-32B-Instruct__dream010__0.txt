As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and obstacles designed to test your skills, perseverance, and creativity. The first challenge involves a team-building exercise where you must work with strangers from different backgrounds to design a blueprint for a sustainable community. Despite language barriers and differing opinions, your diverse group finds common ground and creates an impressive, thoughtful design that impresses the judges.

Next, you're faced with an individual challenge: you must deliver a presentation on your career goals and how winning this competition would help you achieve them.

In the final round, you're tasked with solving a real-world problem facing a local business.

Your solution involves creating a social media marketing strategy that leverages influencer partnerships, targeted advertising, and engaging content. You work tirelessly on your proposal, collaborating with experts in digital marketing to refine your approach before presenting it to the business owners and the judges.

As the competition draws to a close, the judges share their verdict. After what feels like an eternity, they announce the winner—and it’s you!
