The memories that linger lingering tell a haunting tale of a young man - Alex, who has spent years studying the ancient cultures he was drawn to as a child. He's been fascinated by the city of Aethoria for hours now and his name echoes through the streets like a siren's call. As you wander, a young woman appears near him on a deserted street corner. Her skin glimmers with excitement despite being disoriented from her initial run-in with the crowds - she seems more out of place in this unfamiliar world than he is in anything he can see at first glance.

As you approach her, Alex notices that she's looking at something within his peripheral vision - a book or some other object on display. She approaches him and starts speaking to him. His words are jumbled together as he tries to recall their conversation last encounter: "I was reading about the ancient cults of the underworld, how to balance light against darkness," and then more precisely, "How to create 'good' magic with a single pinch."

However, when Alex asks about the city, she points directly at an unfamiliar building. Her eyes widen as she recounts her memory - "I went to a bookstore last night and read my favorite classic novel by Alice in Wonderland," but there is something out of place on that particular shelf: "A strange box with a map hanging attached." The image fills Alex's mind's eye, and he begins to struggle to recall her previous story.

As you continue their discussion more freely, Alex notices she has been staring at something near the abandoned shopping street corner nearby. A small building looms large from the shadows beyond, its windows glinting with a faint crescent moon before fading into the fog that rolls in closer. Alex wonders what hidden dangers lie within those two buildings and starts to wonder just when they will be open again - or whether you are indeed a part of this city.

You continue through the remaining portion of his thoughts, continuing your journey through Aethoria as if searching for answers amidst the sea of unfamiliar sights.
