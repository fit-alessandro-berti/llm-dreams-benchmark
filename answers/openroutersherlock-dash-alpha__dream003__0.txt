You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and glowing runes etched into its surface, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat. The air around it hums with an otherworldly energy, making your fingers tingle as you trace the symbols. Suddenly, the runes shift under your touch, rearranging into a riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

An echo whispers through your mind—*an echo*—and the box clicks open with a soft sigh. Inside, a shimmering orb floats, revealing visions of forgotten worlds: soaring through nebulae on wings of stardust, dancing with shadow creatures in endless twilight forests, and whispering secrets to ancient stars. But as you reach for the orb, the dream fractures—the box dissolves into swirling mist, the visions fade, and you awaken with the echo's riddle lingering in your ears, the taste of cosmic wind on your tongue. What happens next in *your* dream?
