...and suddenly, the room stretches out like an endless ballroom, mirrors on every wall reflecting infinite versions of yourself, each one slightly off-kilter—one with mismatched eyes, another with feathers instead of hair. The air hums with laughter that echoes in reverse, and the floor beneath your feet feels like it's made of warm, pulsing jelly.

You weave through the first group: a cluster of Victorian-era gentlemen in top hats, sipping tea from cups that float mid-air. One turns to you, his mustache twitching like a living caterpillar, and whispers, "The key to finding your friend is in the forgotten melody." Before you can ask what he means, he dissolves into a swirl of smoke, leaving behind a single, glowing music note that hovers and then pops like a bubble.

Pushing forward, you bump into a circle of animals dressed in tuxedos— a fox DJ spinning records on a turntable made of clouds, a giraffe bartender mixing drinks that change color with every sip. The fox leans in, its eyes sparkling like disco balls, "Dance with us, dreamer! Your friend is just a twirl away." You hesitate, but your feet move on their own, pulling you into a waltz where gravity flips, and you're dancing on the ceiling. Laughter bubbles up from your throat, but it's not yours—it's the sound of distant thunder.

As the dance ends, you spot a door at the far end, shimmering like heat haze. Through it, another group: shadowy figures from your childhood memories, teachers and old classmates, but they're all whispering secrets you already know, like "The cake was never real" or "Time folds like origami." One classmate, who you remember as shy, now has wings of iridescent paper and hands you a map drawn in crayon. "Follow the stars that fall upward," she says, and the map ignites in your palm, turning to ash that reforms into a compass pointing everywhere at once.

Frustration builds—where is that one person? The crowd thickens, faces blurring into masks of clocks and flowers. You call out their name, but it comes out as a song, drawing everyone closer. Finally, a hand grabs yours—it's them! But as you turn, their face shifts: first your best friend, then a stranger, then your own reflection. "I've been here all along," they say, voice echoing in layers. The room spins, colors bleeding into a vortex, and you feel yourself falling upward into a sky of floating invitations.

Then, just as the dream peaks, you wake up in your bed, heart racing, with a single party streamer tangled in your sheets, whispering faintly in the dark. Was it real? You close your eyes, and the gathering calls you back...
