...and you realize you're still in your pajamas. Your coworkers are all walking around in formal business attire, and you can't seem to find your shoes anywhere. The presentation materials are scattered across your desk, but the pages are all blank except for doodles you drew as a child.

You try to speak to explain the situation, but no sound comes out. Your boss is gesturing impatiently at their watch, which is spinning counterclockwise and showing dates from next year. The office walls seem to be closing in slowly, covered in sticky notes with reminders about meetings you've never attended.

Just as panic sets in, you notice a friendly colleague approaching with a steaming cup of coffee and a reassuring smile, holding out a pen that somehow writes in mid-air, creating words that float and rearrange themselves into a perfect project plan. The deadline on the calendar suddenly shifts to a reasonable timeframe, and you find yourself dressed professionally, ready to tackle the challenge with newfound confidence.

The dream fades as you settle into a sense of calm competence, knowing somehow that everything will work out.
