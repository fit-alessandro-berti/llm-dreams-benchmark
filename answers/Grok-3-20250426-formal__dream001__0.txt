navigate the labyrinthine streets, the city's towering spires casting long shadows across your path. The air hums with a strange energy, and the faces of passersby blur into indistinct shapes, their voices a soft, unintelligible murmur. You clutch a crumpled note in your hand, the only clue to your destination, but the ink has smudged, leaving only fragments of an address: "...Tower... 7th... Sky."

Determined, you approach a street vendor whose cart glows faintly with bioluminescent fruits. You ask for directions, but the vendor responds in riddles, pointing toward a distant plaza where "the clock ticks backward." With no time to decipher the cryptic words, you hurry onward, the urgency of the meeting pressing against your chest like a weight. The city seems to shift around you—alleys twist, buildings lean closer, and the sky pulses with an unnatural hue, as if the dream itself is alive and watching.

At the plaza, you find the backward-ticking clock, its hands spinning in reverse. A figure in a long, silver coat stands beneath it, holding a map that shimmers like liquid glass. "You're late," they say, though their voice is calm, almost amused. You explain your confusion, and they hand you the map, which reveals the city as a kaleidoscope of interconnected paths, each leading to a different version of the meeting. "Choose wisely," they warn, "for not all meetings are what they seem."

You study the map, its routes glowing with faint symbols: a crown, a flame, a door. Each path feels significant, but the clock's relentless ticking reminds you time is slipping away. You select the path marked with the door, drawn to its promise of answers. As you follow it, the city transforms—streets widen, lights brighten, and the air grows warm with the scent of blooming flowers. The Tower of the 7th Sky looms ahead, its glass facade reflecting your own uncertain face.

Inside, the meeting room is a vast chamber where voices echo without source. Figures sit at a circular table, their features obscured by halos of light. They speak of a decision that will "reshape the weave of things," but their words feel directed at you, as if you are the key to their plans. You try to speak, to ask why you're here, but your voice catches, and the room begins to dissolve, the figures fading into mist.

You wake with the sensation of falling, the note still clenched in your hand—but now, in the dim light of your room, the smudged ink is gone, replaced by a single, clear word: "Begin."
