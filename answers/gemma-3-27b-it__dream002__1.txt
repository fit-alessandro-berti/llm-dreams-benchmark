You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air thickens, smelling of ozone and wet earth. The dappled sunlight vanishes, replaced by a bruised, purple gloom. The birds, moments ago chirping a cheerful chorus, fall silent. A low rumble vibrates through the ground, not quite thunder yet, more like the growl of a sleeping giant.

I quicken my pace, instinctively seeking shelter, but there's *nothing*. No caves, no thickets dense enough to offer protection. Just towering trees, their leaves beginning to thrash wildly in a rising wind. The first fat raindrops begin to fall, splattering on the forest floor like liquid silver. 

Then, it's not rain anymore. It's… feathers.

Thousands, millions of black feathers, swirling down from the canopy, obscuring the light. They aren't falling *with* the wind, they *are* the wind. They whip around me, stinging my face, filling my mouth. I try to shield myself, but it's useless. The forest is being unmade, disassembled into a blizzard of dark plumage.

And then I see *it*. 

High above, between the churning branches, a shape is forming. Not a cloud, but something… colossal. A wing, impossibly large, unfolding slowly, blotting out the last vestiges of the sky. It's not feathered like the storm around me, but leathery and black, like the wing of a bat, but scaled like a dragon. 

As the wing fully extends, I realize it's attached to a creature unlike anything I've ever imagined. It's a bird, but not a bird. It's a being woven from shadow and storm, with eyes that burn like cold fire. It doesn't *look* at me, it *feels* me, a tiny speck in its vast awareness. 

And it begins to sing.

Not a song of birdsong, but a song of creation and destruction, a melody that resonates deep within my bones, pulling at something ancient and forgotten. The feathers intensify, the wind howls, and the creature's song… it's not meant for my ears. It's meant for the forest itself, and the forest is *answering*.

The trees begin to move, not swaying in the wind, but *walking*. Their roots tearing free from the earth, their branches reaching like skeletal arms. The forest is waking up, and I realize, with a chilling certainty, that I'm not just witnessing a storm. I'm witnessing a rebirth. 

And I'm not sure if I'm meant to be a part of it, or swept away by it.



Then, a single, black feather lands on my outstretched hand, and I feel a strange pull, a yearning to… fly.
