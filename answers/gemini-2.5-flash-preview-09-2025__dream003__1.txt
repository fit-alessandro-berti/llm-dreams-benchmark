...the intricate patterns are not etched, but **alive**—they pulse with a faint, silvery light. They form maps of impossible constellations, stars that shift slowly, agonizingly, like oil settling on water.

As I bring my eyes closer, the patterns resolve into miniature, swirling galaxies, each one spinning on its own axis, humming a frequency too low for my ears but high enough to vibrate the bone beneath my temples. The metal of the box is warm now, breathing.

There is no hinge, no latch, only this shifting puzzle. I realize the movement of the stars must be controlled by something, but my hands are useless. I try to push on a certain spiral arm, the one that mimics the Great Bear, but my finger passes straight through, meeting cold, solid metal beneath the illusion.

Frustration mounts, and I lean back, closing my eyes, letting the phantom hum of the box wash over me. In the dark of my eyelids, the constellations continue to spin, but now I see them as memories—a pattern of lights in the window of a childhood home, the accidental scatter of spilled sugar on a dark kitchen floor.

When I open my eyes, the box is no longer resting on the worn mahogany table; it is floating a foot above the surface. I understand now: the box doesn't need a physical key. It needs alignment.

I raise my hands, not to touch it, but to match the rhythm of its internal spin. I try to hold still, to stop the frantic, anxious movement of my own thoughts. As my breathing slows, matching the agonizing pace of the revolving stellar patterns, a specific constellation—one I had never noticed before, shaped like an open eye—stops moving entirely.

The humming ceases.

The box does not unlock, nor does it dissolve. Instead, the entire structure tilts, the weight of the universe inside shifting. The metal walls peel back, folding inwards with the soft, tearing sound of wet parchment.

Inside, there is no treasure, no artifact, and no message. There is only a vast, silent emptiness, perfectly dark and impossibly deep.

And from that darkness, a single drop of liquid light rises, shimmering like liquid mercury. It doesn't move towards me, but upward, gathering speed until it hits the ceiling, passes straight through the plaster, and vanishes.

When the light is gone, the box closes itself, sealing without a seam, and the intricate, pulsing patterns of the universe begin to spin once more.

I reach out to touch the cold, solid metal. It is perfectly silent, perfectly locked. I look up at the ceiling where the drop disappeared, realizing that whatever I sought was never *inside* the box, but released by it.

I feel myself sinking, the heavy sense of waking pulling at the edges of the room, and the box, still humming softly, slowly fades into the texture of the mahogany table until nothing remains but the dark, cool wood.
