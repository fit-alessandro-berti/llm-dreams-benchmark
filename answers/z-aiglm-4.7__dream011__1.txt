written not in words, but in shifting, three-dimensional geometric shapes made of light that hover just above the paper.

As I squint to decipher the first rotating figure—a complex, glittering tetrahedron—the silence in the room suddenly becomes heavy, like physical pressure. I reach for my pen, but my fingers close around air; the pen has transformed into a long, slender feather.

I look up at the clock to check the time, but the face of the clock has no hands. Instead, it is a smooth, white egg that pulses with a faint, rhythmic glow.

Panic begins to rise in my chest, but when I try to breathe, I inhale water. The air is thick and salty. I look around the lecture hall and realize the other students are no longer sitting in chairs; they are treading water, their heads bobbing gently in a dark, infinite ocean. The invigilator stands at the front of the room, but she has grown to the size of a giant, and she is wearing a mask made of mirrors.

"You cannot solve the problem," she booms, her voice sounding like the crash of waves, "until you become the equation."

I look down at my desk, which is now a small wooden raft bobbing on the swell. The geometric shapes are drifting away from the paper, dissolving into the dark water like ink. I have to catch them. I dive off the raft, plunging deep into the cold, silent abyss, reaching for the glowing shapes, but the deeper I go, the larger they become—until I realize the questions are actually constellations, and I am floating in the middle of space, holding my breath for an eternity.
