The patterns aren't carved *on* the box; they *are* the surface, shifting like veins of light beneath obsidian. They pulse gently with a deep, internal luminescence – swirling fractals that defy geometry, constellations that rearrange themselves, and symbols that seem to whisper ancient languages at the edge of hearing. You reach out, fingers trembling, and touch the cool, smooth surface where the light flows.

A jolt, not electrical, but resonant, like striking a massive tuning fork deep within the earth. The patterns flare brighter, momentarily blinding, then coalesce. They don't form a keyhole. Instead, they rearrange, flowing like liquid silk into a complex, three-dimensional lock mechanism hovering inches above the box's surface. It's made purely of light and shadow, intricate gears and sliding panels of pure energy.

"Where's the key?" you whisper, heart pounding against your ribs.

The patterns shimmer. A single, larger symbol pulses in the center of the light-lock: an eye, unblinking, infinitely deep. A voice, not heard but *felt*, resonates in your mind, ancient and calm: *"The key is not found. It is *forged*."*

Forged? From what? You look around the dream-space – a void of swirling nebulae and floating islands of crystal. There's nothing obvious. The light-lock pulses expectantly. You feel a pull, not physical, but intellectual and emotional. It seems to demand something *from you*.

You close your eyes, concentrating. Think of your deepest longing, your greatest fear, the secret you guard most fiercely... the memory of warm sunlight on your face as a child... the crushing weight of regret... the fierce protectiveness you feel for someone... the burning curiosity that fuels your waking life...

As you hold these thoughts, feelings, memories like tangible objects, you feel warmth gather in your palm. You open your eyes. Above the light-lock, hovering in the air before you, a shape is forming. It twists and solidifies, forged from pure light – but its shape is uniquely *yours*. It might resemble a stylized heart, a spiral galaxy, a key with jagged, emotional teeth, or something utterly indescribable, yet profoundly *right*. It pulses with the same inner light as the box's patterns.

You reach out and place your hand around it. It fits perfectly into the central cavity of the light-lock. The moment they touch, the lock doesn't turn. It *melts*. The intricate gears and panels dissolve like smoke, flowing back into the box's surface. The obsidian skin ripples, smooths, and then dissolves entirely, not breaking, but *folding inward* like a curtain drawn aside.

Beyond it isn't treasure, or emptiness. It's a miniature cosmos contained within the box's former space. Stars wheel in miniature nebulae, miniature galaxies spiral silently, and at the very center, a tiny, perfect sun pulses gently. It feels impossibly vast, yet contained. This is the prize not of wealth, but of *understanding* – the universe in miniature, a reflection of the infinite held within the finite, unlocked not by a key, but by the forging of your own inner essence. You reach towards the tiny sun, knowing that touching it will dissolve the dream entirely, leaving you with the echo of its light within your waking mind.
