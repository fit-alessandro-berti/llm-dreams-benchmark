e under the guidance of dreamers, I can help you solve the following problem:

🤔
You dream of escaping a parallel universe 🌍 by solving three conundrums. 🧩 The struggle to wake up from this eerie dream will demand all your wit and intellect. 🥵🔥

But before you can divert from this confusing nightmare, you are tasked with finding the following integer combinations. 🔍🔢

1. Sum of all powers of 3
2. Sum of all powers of 7
3. Sum of all powers of 42

I'll be there to help you with the first step. 🔨✨

sum_powers_3 = sum([3 ** i for i in range(1,17)])  # range excludes the 0 power
print("Sum of all powers of 3:", sum_powers_3)

sum_powers_7 = sum([7 ** i for i in range(1,17)])  # range excludes the 0 power
print("Sum of all powers of 7:", sum_powers_7)

sum_powers_42 = sum([42 ** i for i in range(1,17)])  # range excludes the 0 power
print("Sum of all powers of 42:", sum_powers_42)

To compute the sum of the number of powers of 5, 6, and 11, you would have to alter the ranges as follows. As an example, here's how you'd do it for 5: 🔧

sum_powers_5 = sum([5 ** i for i in range(1, 11)])  # Use the appropriate range for powers of 5
print("Sum of all powers of 5:", sum_powers_5)

For 6 and 11, you'd act similarly and adjust the ranges accordingly. Are you making some progress with the question you were previously tasked with? If not, then this may serve as a starting point for figuring out the final conundrum. 🎉
