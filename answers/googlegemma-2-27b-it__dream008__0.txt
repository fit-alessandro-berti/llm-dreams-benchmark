...feel a cold sweat blooming across my forehead. The words "impossible deadline" echo in my dream-head, bouncing off the now shimmering, silver walls of the office. "Start immediately!" booms my boss, a terrifying, shadowy figure who only ever seems to loom two sizes larger than in real life.

Her voice echoes with a strange resonance, each word a clang of exhaustion against the gong of my internal panic button. The keyboard I'm staring at morphs into a ticking clock, its digital numbers flashing like red warning lights.

The impossible deadline – a ridiculous one even for a dream – is for "The Eternal Garden Project" choked out the email reminder on the screen. It's an image from the office promotional material advertising our new, self-watering plant holder. Two weeks to launch, but I squeeze my eyes closed, willing the dread away. My subconscious eye, wired open by the ridiculous bureaucracies of the dream world, sees the impossible – getting it to every store in the country before I've even begun designing the damn thing! 

But wait, wasn't this the whole point of the "ergonomic pot"? The company wanted employees able to slip back and forth between logic and ludicrousness. 

My mind finally focuses, and through blurry dream eyes, I've got clearer instructions:

* **Project commissioned by:** Natura Corp (weird, I don't think my desk plant-themed dreamscape comes with specifics)...

I jolt awake. A wave of relief washes over me, a momentary pause in the surge of absurdity that seemed to define this strange bed-fellowship with my subconscious. "Two weeks?" I mumbled, still half in the land of sleep. This was The Eternal Garden Project, but with a twist. in this surreal dream, any attempt to categorize any task broke me out of it. No leaves to be raked here. It suddenly hits me. The email was from an AI. I swipe at the glowing screen and it disappears, replaced by a tangled mess of vines and flowers, in vibrant color and motion, defying the stillness of the buried instructions, but echoing the image of "The Eternal Garden". My dream-brain, confidently assuming this was another bizarre labor-related hallucination, tries to make sense of its clarity. An email about *plants*? How ridiculous. This *is* my life, then. Working barefoot in a rainforest, my boss, a disembodied voice now, was insistent. 

* **The clock began to tick even faster, leaped months ahead in my dream.**

I stare at the advanced robot arm tinkering with my actual desk lamp now, hoping the dream wasn't too accurate. It feels too close to waking life. Maybe I can find some common sense in here, after all. I blink back the disorientation and see intricate circuits and wires, the intricate workings of my new brainchild reminder.

A different kind of feeling surged now. This was no ordinary deadline, this was...no, it can't be!

I scrambled out of bed, grabbing my throbbing head. The pain subsided as I rediscovered my room, the familiar setting providing a sense of grounding. The bandage... it felt real, rough against my skin.

The email said it was due in two weeks. It didn't specify "when I wake up." Didn't it mention a deadline? My head whirred. I stared at the itinerary that was predicted across my phone screen, a ridiculous technological overreach – a text reminder to remind me (and presumably any unlucky soul who builds these plant-laden automated beings) to neurotically clutching the coffee mug on my nightstand, a tiny succulent crammed insecurely in its grip. I quickly realized it was a ticketing error, a glitch in my perception.

Before I could sit down, I felt the searing pain again, but this time, it wasn't just my head.

Each sip of water I tried to take in waking life only brought a twinge of sadness as the taste only surfaced unsettling memories of the tasty, but hypothetical, "happiness juice" concoction that was also marketed as an ant pheromone disruptor.

Dissonance.

Another jolt. I found myself in my kitchen, now crouched on the floor, the familiar, warm flooring of my home suddenly foreign and freezing under the pressure of a looming deadline, two days until the deadline!

My heart hammered in my chest, my pulse a throbbing echo of the deadlines cutting through the dream fog of the almost-gone two weeks. It doesn't matter if this was an impossible outcome. The innovation of the contraption my fictionalized, plant-loving persona had created paused me, a moment of fear and reflection poking through the bedraggled husk of my drowsiness.

But I knew something had to be done. The law firm was a mess – a whirlwind of deadlines, impossible expectations, and exorbitant fees, even for a... well, especially for a fictional second-hand succulent dispenser? I had to laugh.

What a strange juxtaposition, reality and the dream intertwined. The firm, Natura Corp, would have to wait. I could grab a real coffee later.


As I stumbled back to my bed, grabbing the ice pack I'd brought down from the storage room, "The Improvement"

...The walls solidified into familiar, albeit dreary looking, desk walls, and the throbbing pain I oversaw, under my own influence... I am used to the sharp pain...gone and replaced with the familiar comfort of a dream office, an effigy of the firm itself. I could see it – the succulent company’s sleek, modern facade wavering and then collapsing, leaving behind a messy piles of sunflowers

As I hit the pillow, the image faded back into the swirling, inconsistent reality...my dream reminded me of all the people I needed to see before returning to my dreamscape. It was time to address the class action on behalf of, 
of fine, organic fertilizer...

...an amount of which I learn was left unexplored.

...

The next few days are a scramble. The pressure builds, though. It seems my world is in more danger

And then it hits me. My new, all-encompassing concern doesn’t smell like cheap coffee anymore, it smells like... desperation? I give the instructions a curt nod, a disturbingly familiar pang in my chest for the dire reality
