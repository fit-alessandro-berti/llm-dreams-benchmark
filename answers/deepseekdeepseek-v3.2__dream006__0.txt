The spotlight is warm, a gentle pressure on your skin. The expectant silence isn't empty; it’s full, like a held breath. You open your mouth, and the first words come out not as your own, but in the voice of your third-grade teacher, Ms. Abernathy, who taught you about volcanoes.

You say, "The earth is not always quiet."

The audience doesn't seem to notice anything strange. They lean forward. Encouraged, you continue, but now the words are written in the air in front of you, glowing like neon cursive. You read them aloud, but they are about the migratory patterns of arctic terns, a subject you know nothing about. The crowd nods in profound understanding.

A man in the front row has the head of a kindly basset hound. He wags his tail slowly when you make a point about the moon's pull on the tides. You realize you are not wearing pants, but instead, your legs are wrapped in intricate, living ivy that blooms with tiny white flowers as you speak. This feels perfectly appropriate.

You reach the climax of your speech—a point about the interconnectedness of all things, illustrated by the sound a spiderweb makes when plucked by the morning dew. As you prepare to deliver the final, resonant line, you look down at your notes.

They are written on the surface of a calm, dark pond that has replaced the podium. Your own reflection looks up at you, winks, and says the final words for you, in perfect unison with your own voice:

"...and that is why we must remember to water the clocks."

The audience erupts into thunderous applause. They are all standing, their faces beaming with gratitude and insight. As you take a bow, you feel yourself floating, the ivy on your legs now reaching out tendrils to gently pull you up, up, past the stage lights, which have become a constellation of familiar faces, all smiling.

You wake with the feeling of a standing ovation still humming in your chest, and the inexplicable, urgent need to find a watering can.
