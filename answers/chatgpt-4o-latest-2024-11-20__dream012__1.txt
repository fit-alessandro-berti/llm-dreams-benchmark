stand at the helm, gripping the wheel tightly, your knuckles white as the salty spray lashes across your face. The thunder roars overhead, and flashes of lightning illuminate the chaos—a moving labyrinth of towering waves rising to swallow the ship whole. Your crew shouts conflicting advice, their faces pale with fear, but you steady them with one commanding gesture.

“We hold fast!” you shout over the cacophony, your voice rising above the storm. "Raise the mainsail! We need to ride the current, not fight it!"  

The crew hesitates for a moment, but something in your tone anchors them. Trust replaces panic as they spring into action, climbing the rigging and securing lines amid the gale. The ship groans as it tilts precariously, but with a surge of determination, you focus on aligning the bow with the waves' rhythm, letting the immense power of the ocean guide your course.

Suddenly, amidst the chaos, a strange and mesmerizing glow begins to emanate from the water. At first, you think it might be reflections of lightning on the surface, but this light is different—ethereal, almost otherworldly. It pulses and shifts in hues of blue and green, as if alive. The storm, oddly, seems to respond to the presence of the glow, easing ever so slightly, though the waves remain formidable.

One of your crew gasps, pointing toward the sea. “Captain, look!” they cry. A vast, luminous figure begins to emerge from the depths—a leviathan of impossible size, its translucent skin glittering with phosphorescence. The massive creature's soulful, glowing eyes fix on yours, and time itself seems to slow.  

“Captain,” the first mate whispers at your side, breaking the spell. “It’s… waiting. For you.”

The realization settles deep within you. It's more than a monster—it's a sentinel, ancient and intelligent, guarding something sacred beneath the waves. The storm wasn't a random act of nature; it was a trial, a test to see if you were worthy of what lies ahead.

Your hand tightens on the wheel as you consider your next move. Do you sail forward toward the glowing figure, risking everything in search of what it protects? Or do you turn back, shepherding your crew to the safety of calmer waters and abandoning whatever mystery lies below?

The wind howls again, and your heart pounds in your chest. What do you do, Captain?
