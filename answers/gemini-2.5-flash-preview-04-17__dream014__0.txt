...and you feel a fragile thread of hope unfurl in your chest, so unexpected it almost makes you dizzy. You nod, a little stunned, and step forward to join them.

They don't speak much, or maybe they do, but the city's noise shifts around you like a living thing, muffling some sounds and amplifying others. One of the strangers, whose face seems familiar in a way you can't place, offers a gentle smile and gestures for you to walk between them. As you fall into step, the crushing weight of being alone begins to lift.

The streets seem to rearrange themselves slightly as you walk – a building that was there a moment ago is suddenly gone, replaced by a patch of sky the color of bruised plums. The harsh neon lights soften into a warm, pulsing glow. The other people in the crowd, who had felt like an impassable wall, now seem to flow around your small group like water around stones.

You don't know where they are leading you, but a quiet trust blooms in the space where your fear had been. The air smells faintly of rain and something sweet, like honeysuckle, even though it's a dry, urban night. You look at the strangers walking beside you – their faces are kind, their movements easy – and for the first time in this bewildering dream, you feel like you are exactly where you are supposed to be, moving forward into the shimmering, uncertain light ahead.
