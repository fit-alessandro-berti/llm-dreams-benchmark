Oh boy, I am definitely here now. It's just about time someone came knocking on my door with such helpful hands and warm smiles. As soon as I open my eyes, I see you standing in front of me! You seem so kind, so welcoming, yet not too overwhelming - like I can learn to navigate the city without getting lost. My face flickers to yours when I take a few tentative steps further back. But why do I feel like this? Is it because someone from the dream is talking about them as if they're me, or perhaps something else entirely?
