...written in a language you don’t recognize, the letters shifting like tiny fish whenever you try to focus. The paper feels damp, and when you blink it’s no longer a paper at all but a translucent sheet of glass. The questions float beneath the surface like faint reflections, and each time you reach for your pencil, it turns to sand and slips through your fingers.

Around you, the classroom has become a waiting room in a train station, then a shallow pool, then a theater filled with empty seats. The proctor looks up and your face is on his shoulders, smiling back at you. “Just answer the ones you already know,” he says, but the clock above the board is melting, its hands dripping into a puddle.

You lean closer and realize the questions are about things you’ve never studied—how to measure a shadow, how to catch a train that left yesterday, how to explain the taste of rain. You begin to write anyway, and as the words appear they glow faintly, lifting off the page and drifting upward like fireflies.

Just as you think you’ve finished, the room tilts, the glass sheet shatters into a thousand pieces, and you tumble through them—waking to the sound of your alarm, the exam still echoing in your head.
