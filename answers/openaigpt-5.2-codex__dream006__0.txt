…speak, but no sound comes out. The microphone in your hand feels oddly light, and when you look down you see it has turned into a sunflower. The audience’s faces blur and stretch like reflections in water, and your notes are just blank pages fluttering in a wind that wasn’t there a moment ago. 

You clear your throat and, instead of words, a flock of tiny paper birds rises into the air, circling above you and drawing the crowd’s gaze upward. The stage beneath your feet begins to tilt, becoming the deck of a ship that glides forward into a misty ocean. 

A calm voice behind you whispers, “Just jump,” and when you do, the sea opens into a star-filled sky. You are floating, weightless, the audience now a constellation around you, their expectant faces glowing like moons. You open your mouth to speak again, and this time your voice pours out as light, filling the dark with the warmth of a sunrise—right before you wake.
