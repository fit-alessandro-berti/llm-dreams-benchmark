...decide to step back. Not physically—your feet stay rooted to the creaky wooden floor of that old, dimly lit kitchen you used to share—but inwardly. Something shifts behind your ribs, like a locked drawer clicking open.

You look at your friend—*really* look. Not at the sharp set of their jaw or the fire in their eyes that moments ago mirrored your own rage, but at the faint smudge of flour still clinging to their temple from baking earlier. You remember how they’d hummed that off-key lullaby while kneading dough, how they’d saved you the burnt, crispy corner of the bread because they knew it was your favorite.

The argument had been about trust—about a secret you kept to “protect” them, and their feeling of betrayal when they found out. Important. Real. But suddenly, in the charged silence that follows your unspoken retreat, you see it differently: not as a wall between you, but as a wound you both keep prodding, mistaking pain for proof the other doesn’t care.

So instead of sharpening your next point, you exhale. The sound is loud in the quiet. “I was scared,” you say, your voice rough but softer now. “Scared you’d think I didn’t believe in you. That I thought you couldn’t handle it.”  

Their shoulders tense, then drop. The fire in their eyes doesn’t vanish, but it dims to embers. “And I was scared you didn’t trust me enough to tell me,” they whisper back, fingers twisting the frayed edge of their apron—the one you gave them for their birthday, now stained with jam and time.

Outside, rain begins to patter against the window, washing the dust from the glass. You don’t solve everything right then. The hurt is still there, tender as a bruise. But you reach for the teapot on the stove—still warm—and pour two cups without asking. The steam rises between you, not as a barrier, but as something shared. Something that might, slowly, clear the air.  

And in the dream, that’s enough. For now, it’s enough.
