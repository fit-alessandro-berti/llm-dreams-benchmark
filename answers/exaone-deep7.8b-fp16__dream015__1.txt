You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **rally the scattered survivors near the ruins of the old power plant**, believing their collective effort might reignite hope and functionality. Though supplies are dwindling and bullets scar the trek, you carry a makeshift first aid kit and agree to lead a risky assault on the fortified facility. Inside, you discover mostly rust and shattered containment units—but also evidence of hidden caches of medical supplies and clean water. After hours of clanking gates opened slowly, the team gathers what they can, their breath ragged but determined. As the last member collapses into the safety of the storage tunnel, you share a nod of grim satisfaction. For now, the shadow of collapse grows lighter.
