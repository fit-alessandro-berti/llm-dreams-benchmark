...end the conversation before it escalates further. The words hang unfinished in the air between you, charged with emotion. You hold up a hand, take a slow, deep breath, and say, "I can't do this right now. I'm too upset, and I'm going to say something I don't mean. I need to walk away and cool off."

Your friend's face is a storm of frustration and hurt, but they don't stop you. You turn and walk out of the room, the silence behind you feeling heavier than any shouted insult.

You find yourself outside, though you don't remember opening a door. The world has the hyper-real, yet subtly wrong, quality of a dream. The light is twilight, but the shadows are too long and move on their own. The street you're on is familiar, but the houses are arranged in an impossible loop.

You start walking, your shoes making no sound on the pavement. With every step, the heat of the argument drains from you, replaced by a cool, melancholy calm. You replay the disagreement in your head, and for the first time, you can see your friend's point of view clearly, without the filter of your own defensiveness. You understand their fear, their pride, the specific history that shaped their position. A pang of regret hits you, not for your own beliefs, but for the way you argued for them.

Ahead, on a park bench that suddenly exists under a flickering streetlamp, sits your friend. They are looking at their hands, their shoulders slumped. You approach, not with the tension of the argument, but with a deep, dream-logic certainty.

You sit beside them. The air is still.

"I get it," you say, and your voice is quiet but clear in the unnatural silence. "I understand why you feel that way."

They look up, and their anger is gone, replaced by a weary sadness. "I'm sorry, too," they reply. "I wasn't listening either."

You don't solve the problem. The core disagreement is still there, a tangible thing between you. But the need to be *right* has vanished. In its place is the simple, profound need to not lose your friend over this.

You both sit in that quiet understanding, the unsolvable problem now just a shared burden instead of a wall. The dream doesn't need to resolve the argument. It resolved the anger. The first star appears in the twilight sky, and it looks like an perfect, glowing point of peace.

You wake up with the feeling of that peace still resting gently on you, and the first thing you do is reach for your phone.
