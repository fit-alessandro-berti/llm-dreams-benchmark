...As I moved deeper into the maze, the scent of woodsmoke grew stronger, weaving through the air with a faint whisper of lavender.  A flicker of oil-lamp light danced in the distance, the only source of illumination in this stony, puzzling labyrinth.  As I approached, the light solidified into a small, flickering lantern hanging from a gnarled branch. An old woman, nestled amidst a clump of vibrant, purple lavender bushes, handed me the lantern.

She wore a shawl woven from the scent of the violet smoke I had followed, its source a pipe she puffed on relentlessly, yet smelling faintly of lavender and courage.  "This will help you, child," she had rasped, her voice surprisingly strong for such a frail frame. "But be warned, the scent is a double-edged sword. It will guide you, but also conceal. Many have wandered these paths, lost forever to the maze's tricks."

I'd reached a dead end, but the flicker of her lantern seemed to promise illumination, a way out. The old woman, who I imagined was a keeper of sorts, a neutral force in this arboreal domain, smiled knowingly, her eyes sparkling like the lighter flint. The maze hummed with an energy, a low thrumming resonating through the hollow ground. It was startlingly clear – the air itself crackled with a strange magnetism.

This was no ordinary maze.

The woman, wrinkled and weathered like the ancient stones around her, disappeared into the maze's depths before I could ask about the mysterious hum. "Trust your senses," she'd said, a wisp of smoke curling from her lips and disappearing into the dusk. "Follow the scent of courage, child. It burns brighter than any torch."

Her words echoed in my mind, but there was a mixture of frustration and curiosity in my response.  Being trapped in a maze filled with puzzles on a whim made sense. It felt more intricate than it looked; a labyrinth unto itself woven within the puzzles. 

The air swirled with purple haze, and I see my purpose wasn't just to solve puzzles, but to absorb it. A deeper purpose was at play, and it grew the further into the maze I ventured. The lantern's curious weight – a solidity of purpose where there was none before – draws me forward. I look around.

"Enough of the maze’s tricks," I muttered to myself. "I need to get out of here.” I knew that getting myself to cafeteria 227 was far more important than solving any maze myself.

As I delve into cafeteria 227, the air thickens with the sweetness of forgotten snacks and the unsavory smell of burnt toast lingers. 

The walls seem to whisper puzzles instead of the rumble I feel in my stomach urging me to leave this place.  The tables and chairs form a grid of interlocking mazes, their wooden surfaces dulled by the passage of time and countless meals served.

I ignore the rumbling and the faint smell of a thousand forgotten ballads. The air breathes history, the scent could be ash, dust, MREs, or dust bunnies.  My gut remembers the allure of the prodigal sandwich that my old friend, the Grilled Cheese, declared a snack shortage earlier. The old man had said that there were not enough melinized protein combos, 6-05, within the cafeteria to make raccoon eyes go away, at least not as quickly as he wanted them to. His booming voice echoed throughout the clearing, the dull thud of a hammer striking a nail on a sunday morning, tinged with irritation: "The simplest dilemmas have the simplest solutions. A hammer and a nail can't solve all the problems here. Cumin!"


Now, a thousand flickering thoughts danced in the corners of my mind, "But she needs a thousand words to solve this next bar." The inscription "This is a paradise for the human spirit but a nightmare for shoplifters" felt poignant given the constant dilemma of my own multiple food rations splayed on the table before me: one MRE – Lobster and Butter Sauce, lacking any accompanying companions.
