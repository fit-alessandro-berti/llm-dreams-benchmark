You are dreaming. In this dream, you find yourself at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and overhear snippets of conversations that spark your curiosity—some discussing hobbies, others laughing over jokes, and one person animatedly telling a story with grand hand gestures. The room buzzes with energy: music plays in the background, chatter fills the air, and people mill about, forming little clusters of connection. You feel a mix of intrigue and hesitation, wanting to join in but unsure since these faces are unfamiliar.

As you weave through the crowd, scanning for your friend, you accidentally bump into someone. "Oh, sorry!" you say, and they flash a kind smile, replying, "No worries, it’s crowded in here, isn’t it?" You nod, exchange a quick laugh, and move on, feeling a small spark of ease from the brief encounter.

Finally, across the room, you spot your friend chatting with someone. You make your way over, dodging clusters of partygoers, and tap them on the shoulder. They turn around, their face lighting up. "Hey! I was looking for you," you say, relief washing over you. They introduce you to the person they’re with, who welcomes you warmly into the conversation. Together, you and your friend drift into group discussions, meeting new people along the way. Gradually, the lively atmosphere of the party feels less daunting, and you settle into the night, enjoying the company—old and new—around you.
