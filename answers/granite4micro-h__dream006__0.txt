As you step onto the stage, a rush of adrenaline floods your system. Your heart pounds in your chest, but you take a deep breath to center yourself. The lights shine down on you, illuminating every inch of your presence. You glance over at the sea of faces before you - each one carrying an expectant look that mirrors your own. 

You square your shoulders and steel your resolve, reminding yourself that countless people have successfully given speeches before you despite their nerves. A few key memories float to mind:

Years ago when you had to pitch a new idea in front of your colleagues, your hands trembled as they gripped the lectern but you took a steadying breath beforehand and got through it. 
In college, during a debate competition, your throat went dry momentarily but drawing on that inner calm brought up by meditation helped you speak clearly.
At school assemblies when invited to share, you sometimes felt butterflies in your stomach yet kept repeating silently "I am prepared, I am ready".

Taking these cues from past successes, now as the audience watches intently for any sign of wavering, you open your mouth. The first word - “Good afternoon everyone…” echoes out with certainty and calmness. 

As you speak, words flow smoothly one after another – thoughts organized methodically into sentences and paragraphs that make sense. You pause thoughtfully occasionally to emphasize key points but the audience seems eager to listen closely rather than waiting for an awkward lull.

For a moment, in the middle of your presentation, when you notice most eyes locked on you intently, you allow a genuine smile to break out across your face – not forced but natural. The shared human connection fills you with confidence and reassures everyone that this is real, heartfelt communication, not an insincere act.

When all else fades away toward the end of your speech and applause rings louder than expected in response, you hold it gracefully, smiling genuinely once more for the cameras as the dream drifts back into reality. The audience seems less intimidating now; they’re just people who heard a compelling story you had been sharing and wanted to respond positively. Another successful dream completed.

Of course, this is not real life... yet! But perhaps remembering how one can cope with stage nerves by drawing upon past experiences will help prepare for the actual event tomorrow in your waking hours. Good luck and breathe!
