You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and **reach out to touch its edge**. The moment your fingers brush the surface, the canvas shudders like a living thing, and a rush of liquid light spills from its borders, pooling at your feet. The colors are impossibly vivid—cerulean flames, iridescent moss, shadows that gleam like polished silver.  

Suddenly, the canvas begins to *breathe*. Its surface ripples, forming valleys and peaks that mirror the terrain around you, yet twisted: trees sprout wings, rivers flow upward, and stars drip like honey. You notice your own reflection in a nearby puddle of light, but it’s not quite you—your eyes are closed, and your hands are painting strokes in the air, unseen brushstrokes materializing on the canvas.  

Compelled, you press your palm to the center. A jolt of warmth surges through you, and the world shifts. The canvas now displays a memory you’ve never lived—a desert where the sand sings, a tower made of frozen whispers, a version of yourself laughing beside someone you’ve never met. The shapes around you morph to match the scene: the ground becomes glassy dunes, the air hums with phantom melodies.  

But then the edges of the painting fray. The figures turn to smoke, the desert cracks open, and the canvas begins to *consume* itself, swallowing color and form into a voracious void. You realize: this is not just a mirror of your mind, but a hunger. A creator—and a destroyer.  

You stumble back, but the puddles of light cling to your ankles, whispering in languages of pure sensation. The canvas tilts, and suddenly you’re falling—not into it, but *through* it, into a kaleidoscope of half-formed worlds. Each fragment brushes against your skin: a petal that tastes of forgotten birthdays, a clock with hands made of thorns, a melody that smells like rain.  

When you land, you’re back at the canvas—but now it’s no longer blank. It shows a door. Or perhaps a window. Or a mirror. And in its frame, you see the dreamer: **you**, staring back, eyes wide, a brush in hand, ready to begin again.  

The world waits, trembling, for what you’ll create—or erase.
