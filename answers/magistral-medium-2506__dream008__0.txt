feel a surge of panic as the clock on the wall ticks ominously louder. The project documents in front of you blur into meaningless symbols—some pages are even written in a language you don’t recognize. Your computer screen flickers, displaying error messages in bright red.

Just as you’re about to ask for help, you notice your coworkers are all frozen mid-task, their faces eerily blank, like mannequins. The office lights dim, and your boss’s voice echoes strangely, *"You only have five minutes left."* But when you glance at your watch, the hands spin backward.

Suddenly, the floor beneath you tilts, and the walls stretch into an endless hallway. You sprint, but the exit keeps moving farther away. A shadowy figure (your boss? a stranger?) appears at the end of the corridor, holding out a hand—do they want the project, or are they offering an escape?

Then you wake up, gasping, to realize…
