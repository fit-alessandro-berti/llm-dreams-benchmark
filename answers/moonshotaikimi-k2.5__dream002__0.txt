 you feel a storm approaching and **the air turns to humming glass**. The trees—those gentle birches and oaks that were whispering moments ago—begin to *unravel* at the edges, their leaves spinning upward not from wind, but as if the sky has developed a magnetic hunger. The blue above isn't darkening so much as it's **folding**, like someone creasing a watercolor painting to reveal the charcoal sketch hidden beneath.

You run, but your feet sink into moss that has suddenly become **liquid emerald**, each step creating ripples that travel outward and freeze into stepping stones behind you. The first thunderclap doesn't sound like thunder at all—it’s the sound of a thousand books slamming shut in distant libraries, or perhaps the forest itself clearing its throat to speak.

Lightning forks down, but it moves *slowly*, branching through the canopy like luminous roots seeking the earth. Where it touches the ground, mushrooms explode into instant umbrellas of violet and gold, pulsing with bioluminescent warnings. You realize you aren't wet, though the rain is now horizontal, silver needles stitching the air together into curtains of chainmail.

And then you remember (how could you forget?) that **you know how to breathe underwater**, or perhaps you are the storm itself, your heartbeat synced to the distant rumble. The forest floor lifts like a drawbridge, revealing not soil but a staircase spiraling down into the clouds, because in dreams, down is often up, and storms are just the sky's way of rearranging its furniture to make room for you.

You step forward—not away from the tempest, but into it—feeling the electricity dance across your skin not as threat, but as **recognition**. The trees bow as you pass, their bark humming a lullaby in a language you haven't spoken since before you were born, and you understand, with the perfect clarity that only dreams afford, that you have been here before, and the storm has been waiting only for you to arrive.
