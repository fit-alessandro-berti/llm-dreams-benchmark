You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you feel a wave of relief wash over you.

They don’t just point you in the right direction; instead, they seem to have nowhere else to be. One of them, an older woman with a colorful knitted scarf, pulls a crumpled map from her tote bag. Another, a young man with a skateboard, uses his phone to cross-reference the street names. A third, who was just a moment ago busking on a nearby corner with a saxophone, steps closer and listens intently to your description of where you’re trying to go.

"Ah," the woman says, her eyes crinkling as she points a gloved finger at the map. "You’re trying to get to the glass garden, but you’re on the street of echoes. They’re parallel, but you have to listen to hear the path."

The skater nods. "It’s just through here. We’ll walk you."

They begin to lead you, not through the chaotic crowds, but through a narrow alleyway you hadn't noticed before. As you step into the alley, the roar of the city fades. The walls are covered in murals that seem to shift and glow in the twilight. The saxophonist begins to play a soft, melancholic tune that echoes gently off the bricks, creating a rhythm for your footsteps.

You realize you aren’t walking on pavement anymore, but on a path of fallen starlight. The air smells like rain on warm asphalt and cinnamon. You look at your new companions, but they seem to be made of light and shadow now, their forms shimmering.

"Here," the woman says, stopping at the end of the alley. She hands you a small, smooth stone that is inexplicably warm to the touch. "This is to remember that you are never truly wandering alone."

They smile, a collective, radiant expression, and then they turn into the wind and scatter like dandelion seeds. You step out of the alley and find yourself standing on the threshold of a garden made entirely of glass flowers, glowing from within, illuminating a path that leads straight home.

The feeling of being lost is gone, replaced by a quiet, glowing certainty.
