…forget every word I had prepared.

The papers in my hand rustle like dry leaves in a sudden wind, edges curling away from my fingerprints. A hush spreads—thick, syrupy—through the amphitheater, so complete I can hear the small click of my own tongue when I try to swallow. Forty-three seconds of eternity crawl by while the spotlight braids warm gold into the sweat on my palms.

Then something behind my eyes tilts. The microphone stand begins to rise—not mechanically, but organically, the metal unfurling into a single silver sapling. Its buds open into tiny speakers that bloom like morning glories. Instead of my prepared remarks, the leaves rustle with half-remembered lullabies: the one my mother sang with the mangled second verse, the one that played on the car radio the night the city lights went out.

The audience breathes with the rhythm of the song. Row by row they lift their arms—not clapping, not waving, but reaching upward, each person becoming a tuning fork humming the same low note. From the rafters, blackbirds wheel down to perch on their extended wrists, matching their vibration. The sound vibrates the floorboards inside my shoes, climbs the marrow of my tibia until it's ringing in my teeth.

I feel the speech I had practiced dissolve into chalk dust blowing off a blackboard. What replaces it is not language but weather. My hands sculpt cumulus sentences in the air; everyone present sees their childhoods drifting past in those clouds—a red bicycle, a chipped marble, a grandmother’s letter in violet ink. I realize I am only the breeze moving them. The microphone-sapling nods once, sagely, drops one silver seed into my open palm.

When I finally speak I don’t use consonants; I exhale. The seed cracks open and the room floods with the scent of ozone before rain. Each listener receives the same thought not as a statement but as a recollection: *You already know the important part.* I see it kindle in their eyes like struck matches reflected in forty thousand small mirrors. A single column of warmth travels up the center of me—sun inside a telescope—and instead of ending the dream, I simply widen to contain it.
