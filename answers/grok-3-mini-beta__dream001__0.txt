You start to wander the labyrinthine streets, your heart pounding with a mix of anxiety and confusion. The city is a blur of towering skyscrapers that seem to shift and twist like living things, their glass facades reflecting distorted versions of yourself—sometimes tall and stretched, other times shrunk to the size of a child. Neon signs flicker in languages you've never seen, and the crowds around you move like shadows, whispering fragments of directions that make no sense: "Turn left at the clock that ticks backward" or "Follow the river of light under the upside-down bridge."

As the minutes tick away—though time feels elastic, stretching and contracting with each step—you pull out your phone to check a map, only to find it displaying a chaotic mosaic of old memories: your childhood home, a long-forgotten vacation, and suddenly, a floating island in the sky. Desperate, you hail a taxi, but the driver is a talking cat in a suit, who purrs, "The meeting's in your own reflection, but only if you forget why you're there." You climb in anyway, and the car lifts off the ground, soaring through clouds that taste like cotton candy.

Before you know it, you're arriving at a grand hall made entirely of mirrors, where the meeting is already in session. But as you step inside, the faces around the table morph into your own, and you realize with a jolt that the "important meeting" is just a forgotten thought from your waking life. Everything dissolves into a swirl of colors, and you wake up in your bed, the alarm clock blaring, leaving you to wonder if the city was ever real at all.
