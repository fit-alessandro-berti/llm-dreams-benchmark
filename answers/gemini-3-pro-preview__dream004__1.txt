...a paintbrush made of pure glass appears in your hand.

You reach up and catch a passing drift of mist, which turns into iridescent paint on the bristles. As you touch the brush to the canvas, the white surface ripples like a pond disturbed by a stone.

You don’t paint a picture; you paint a feeling. You paint "nostalgia," and the canvas fills with the scent of old books and rain on pavement. You paint "velocity," and the colors begin to spin so fast they hum.

Suddenly, the canvas is no longer an object, but a doorway. The painting pulls you inward. You step through the frame and realize you are now part of the art—you have become a jagged blue triangle floating in a sea of orange whispers, waiting for the next dreamer to pick up the brush.
