You begin to speak, your voice steady at first, but as you look out at the sea of faces, you notice something strange—each person in the audience is holding a tiny, glowing lantern. The light from their lanterns shifts colors as you speak, reflecting the emotions of the crowd. Suddenly, your words feel heavy, as if they’re not yours anymore. They’re being pulled into the air, twisting into shimmering threads that weave between the lanterns, creating a tapestry above the crowd.  

The audience leans in, mesmerized, as the tapestry begins to form images: a storm, a forest, a city dissolving into stardust. You realize you’re not speaking *at* them anymore—you’re *channeling* something, a story not your own. Panic flickers, but then you feel a warmth in your chest, a quiet certainty. You let go, and the tapestry explodes into a thousand fireflies, scattering into the darkened hall.  

The crowd erupts into applause, but as you step back, you notice the lanterns are now extinguished. The audience is gone. On the stage, a single note lies on the podium—a piece of paper with your handwriting: *“The speech was never about you. It was about them.”*  

You wake up, still holding the note, your hands trembling.
