…speak, but as soon as the first words leave your mouth, they do not sound like your voice at all. Instead, it is a deep, resonant tone that seems to echo from the walls and the floor, vibrating through your bones. The audience leans forward, their eyes glistening as if your words carry a deeper meaning than you understand.

You glance down at the podium and realize there is no microphone, no notes—only a sheet of glass with strange, golden symbols etched across it. They shift and swirl as you speak, rearranging themselves in response to sounds you haven’t even made yet. You feel an odd current in the air, a recognition creeping into the faces before you: they know something is about to happen.

Suddenly, the first few rows of the audience dissolve into a rolling mist, and you can no longer tell where the stage ends and the world begins. You keep talking because your voice seems to hold the mist at bay; when you pause, it moves closer, curling at your ankles. Somewhere in the crowd, a single pair of glowing eyes watches you without blinking.

Then you realize—you are not delivering a speech. You are reciting an incantation, and with each phrase, the golden symbols grow brighter. The air tastes like ozone and memory. Something in you knows that if you finish the last line, **everything will change**.

Do you want me to finish the dream with something uplifting or with something mysterious and unsettling?
