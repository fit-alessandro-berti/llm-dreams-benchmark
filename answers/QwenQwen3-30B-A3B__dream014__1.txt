You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you follow them into a labyrinth of neon-lit alleys where the air hums with whispers. Their faces are blurred, as if painted by a child’s imagination, but their voices are warm, like old friends. They lead you to a rooftop garden suspended between skyscrapers, where the sky is a swirling mosaic of colors you’ve never seen.  

One stranger hands you a key made of glass, its edges shimmering with starlight. "The city isn’t lost," they say. "It’s just waiting for you to ask the right question." Another offers a map etched on a leaf, which folds itself into a bird and flies ahead, leaving a trail of glowing dust. As you follow it, the city shifts around you—buildings melt into forests, streets curve into spirals, and the noise of the crowd fades into a gentle hum.  

When you finally reach a mirror-like pond, your reflection isn’t your own. It’s a version of you, radiant and unburdened, smiling as if it’s always known the way. The strangers vanish, leaving only the key and the map. You realize the city was never the destination—it was a test, a reflection of your own uncertainty. The key opens a door in the pond, revealing a path back to where you began, but now the streets feel familiar, as though you’ve always belonged here.  

You wake with the taste of rain and the echo of laughter, unsure if the dream was a escape… or a reminder that even in chaos, you’re never truly alone.
