…the air thickens with the scent of wet earth. Wind snaps the treetops like distant whips, and a low growl of thunder rolls across the sky. You hurry along the moss-soft path, but each step seems slower than the last, as though the forest floor is turning to liquid velvet.

A flash of lightning reveals an ancient oak split down the middle, its hollow glowing faintly gold. Instinct urges you inside just as the first raindrops burst through the canopy. The trunk is wider than any room you’ve known, and the inner bark shimmers like candlelit copper. In the center, a spiral staircase of living roots winds downward.

You descend. With every step the storm’s roar fades, replaced by a hush like held breath. At the base of the roots you emerge into a moonlit clearing—though no moon is visible—where the “rain” has become thousands of drifting silver feathers. They land on your shoulders, weightless and cool.

From the far edge of the clearing a figure approaches: tall, faceless, woven from shadow and starlight. It offers you a single feather, longer than your arm. The moment you grasp it, the storm aboveground moves inside you: wind in your lungs, thunder in your pulse, lightning behind your eyes. Yet instead of fear, you feel clarity, as if every gust is sweeping cobwebs from forgotten thoughts.

The figure dissolves into mist, leaving only the feather in your hand. You raise it instinctively, and it becomes a quill. Across the sky—now a blank canvas—luminous words appear as you write with gestures alone:

“Calm is not the absence of storms,
but the shelter we become.”

With the last stroke, the forest brightens; dawn replaces the turbulent night. You find yourself standing once more on the original path, the trees softly dripping from a rain that never quite reached you. In your palm lies an ordinary oak leaf, veined like a map, reminding you that the shelter you sought was always inside.

And as the first real birdcall rings through the clearing, you wake—still feeling the quiet strength of a storm held in your chest, and the promise that you can weather whatever lies ahead.
