...and you open your mouth to explain that the task is physically impossible, but the only sound that comes out is the faint, high-pitched *thrum* of a rubber band snapping.

Your boss, Mr. Henderson, doesn't seem to notice. He is standing too close, close enough that you can smell the sharp, metallic tang of ozone coming off his perfectly starched collar. He hands you the project brief. It’s not a stack of papers or a USB drive; it's a single, wet dandelion, its head already turning to seed.

"The specifications are within," he whispers, his voice unnaturally calm, "and the deadline is concurrent with the dissipation of the dew point."

You realize the project is to count every filament of the dandelion before the tiny seeds scatter. You try to hold the fragile flower, but your fingers are suddenly thick and clumsy, like gloves filled with lukewarm water.

As you stare at the impossible task, the walls of the cubicle begin to soften. The gray carpet ripples, and the fluorescent light above you buzzes faster and faster, until it sounds like a thousand tiny mosquitos.

Mr. Henderson leans in, and his reflection in your monitor is not his own, but a blurred, frantic version of your own face, smiling widely. He points to the clock, but the clock face is gone. Instead, there is a small, perfectly rendered model of a train chugging along the rim, and with every tick, the train gets infinitesimally closer to the center.

Panic swells in your chest. You need to escape, but the cubicle walls have melted away entirely. You are now standing on a vast, open plain of polished oak flooring that stretches to a horizon painted with sunset hues of violet and deep orange. The dandelion in your hand begins to shed its seeds, one by one, and each seed, when it lands on the oak floor, turns into a single, ringing brass key.

You look back, hoping to see the office door, but Mr. Henderson is gone. In his place stands a high stack of identical, ringing brass keys—the impossible inventory of the seeds already lost. The sound of the keys is overwhelming. You realize that to begin the project, you must first collect all the fallen keys, but every time you bend down to pick one up, ten more fall from the dandelion you are still desperately trying to hold.

The oak floor beneath your feet is no longer stable. It begins to undulate, rolling like choppy water, and the keys slide down into the darkening valley, mocking you with their insistent, clanging sound of time running out.

You clutch the remaining wisps of the dandelion, knowing the deadline has passed, and in that moment of absolute, chaotic failure, you feel yourself falling, falling, until the clang of the keys transforms into the jarring, insistent sound of your actual alarm clock... and you wake up.
