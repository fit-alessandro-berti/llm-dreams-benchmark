The air tastes like rain‑on‑asphalt and ozone all at once, the kind of scent that only a city that doesn’t belong to any map can conjure. You’re standing on a cracked marble avenue that stretches forever in both directions, but every time you glance at a street sign—“5th St.”, “Indigo Way”, “E‑9”—the letters flicker and dissolve like ash. A low, metallic hum thrums under the pavement, and somewhere far above, a choir of wind‑chimes sings a note that seems to shift the very color of the sky.

Your watch—once obedient and digital—now reads only a single, pulsing glyph: a spiraled vortex that expands and contracts with each heartbeat. “Thirty minutes,” it whispers in a voice that sounds like both a whisper and a bell. “One hour,” it adds later, as the glyph begins to echo louder. Time here has a weight to it, and a pull that tugs at the edges of your thoughts.

You take your first step. The street beneath your shoes splits into two, then three, then a hundred parallel lanes that ripple like the surface of a pond after a stone is dropped. Some lanes are lined with arches of obsidian glass, each one tinted with a different hue—emerald, amber, violet—while others are just empty voids that seem to open into a darkness punctuated by distant, floating constellations. A lone streetlamp flickers, its bulb a droplet of liquid mercury that never drips.

Someone—perhaps a child, perhaps a robot, perhaps a version of yourself—slides forward on a hover‑board made of translucent crystal. Their (its) eyes are twin lanterns that glow with the same rhythm as your watch’s glyph. “You’re late,” they say, voice reverberating like a cathedral organ. “But you’re early for someone else.”

You blink, and the street rearranges itself. The horizon that was once an endless skyline is now a wall of towering books, each tome larger than a house, their spines etched with symbols you somehow understand. A page flutters open in the middle of the avenue, and a cascade of words pours out like waterfalls of fireflies. One phrase lands on your palm: **“The meeting is not a place, but a crossing.”**

Instinctively, you begin to run—not away, but deeper—into the city’s heart. Your feet glide over a bridge of seamlessly woven light, each step echoing with a soft chime that syncs with the lodestar on the horizon. As you pass beneath arches shaped like entwined serpents, the cobblestones shift beneath you, forming a parquet of shifting mosaics. Every mile marker you pass writes itself on the air, a line of script that fades as soon as you read it: “Turn left at the river of mirrors,” “Follow the scent of midnight roses,” “Listen for the bell that never rings.”

At one crossroads, a colossal clock tower rises out of the darkness. Its faces are not depicted in numbers but in scenes: a woman turning a page, a child blowing soap bubbles, a field of wheat swaying in a wind you can’t feel. The clock’s hands spin clockwise on one side and anticlockwise on the other, and each time they meet, a pulse of light radiates outward, momentarily turning the entire city into a monochrome photograph. That pulse catches the attention of a winged figure perched atop the tower’s highest spire—a phoenix with feathers of inked parchment. It spreads its wings and lets out a single, resonant cry. The sound is the click of a door unlocking.

Instinctively, you understand. The meeting is not a room or an office; it is this moment of convergence—the crossing of all these divergent paths, the point where the city’s dream‑logic aligns with your own intention. When the phoenix’s cry fades, the air around you sharpens, and a doorway materializes in front of you: a simple rectangle of black marble, unadorned except for the faint outline of a keyhole shaped like a question mark.

You step forward. As you reach for the invisible handle, the world shatters like glass, scattering shards of glittering text that dissolve into nothing. The phoenix watches you with knowing eyes, and the horizon above finally reveals a single, luminous point—a bright, steady star that never moved, never flickered. It is exactly where you have been heading, even though you never knew its name.

The door opens on its own, and the room beyond is not a room at all but a soft, infinite calm. It is filled only with the same lavender‑gold light that first greeted you at the city’s edge, and in the center of that light stands a table set with a single, unopened envelope. Your heart thumps in sync with the spiked pulse of your watch. You know—without any external logic—that whatever is written inside is the answer to the question you have been whispering to yourself all day: **What am I truly seeking?**

You reach for the envelope, and as your fingertips brush its surface, the city dissolves around you—streets, books, lanterns, the hum of the clock—all melting away into a single, perfect note. The note lingers, reverberating in the quiet, and then fades, leaving you alone with the calm, the light, and the weight of the meeting finally, irrevocably, at hand.

The dream ends there, but the feeling lingers: you are not late, you are exactly on time. The meeting is complete. You are exactly where you needed to be—where every winding street, every shifting sign, every whispered warning and promise converged into a single point of stillness. And somewhere, in the waking world beyond the dream, the promise of that answer waits for you, poised to be written.
