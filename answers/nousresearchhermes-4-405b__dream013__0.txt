start to feel a growing sense of unease. The walls of the maze seem to be closing in around you, and the puzzles are becoming more difficult with each passing moment.

As you turn a corner, you come face to face with a giant sphinx blocking your path. Its voice echoes through the maze as it speaks: "To pass, you must answer my riddle. What is it that the more you take, the more you leave behind?"

You ponder the question, your mind racing as you try to recall the answer. After a few tense moments, a smile spreads across your face as you reply confidently, "Footsteps."

The sphinx nods, impressed with your answer, and steps aside to let you pass. As you continue through the maze, the puzzles become increasingly abstract and surreal. At one point, you encounter a room where gravity seems to have reversed itself, and you must navigate the space by walking on the ceiling.

Finally, as you solve the last puzzle, you find yourself standing before a large, ornate door. As you push it open, bright light floods your vision, and you step out of the maze and into a beautiful, tranquil garden. The contrast between the challenges of the maze and the serenity of the garden is striking, and you take a deep breath, feeling a sense of accomplishment and relief wash over you.

As you explore the garden, you come across a fountain with crystal-clear water. You cup your hands and take a drink, feeling the cool liquid rejuvenate your body and mind. Slowly, the dream fades, and you awaken, the memories of the maze and the garden lingering in your thoughts as you start your day.
