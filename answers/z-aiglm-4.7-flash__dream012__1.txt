...and you close your eyes, listening to the thrum of the wood against the water until the panic fades and is replaced by a strange, rhythmic calm. You order the crew to silence, not with a shout, but with a gesture, and then you turn the ship toward the swirling eye of the storm. As the ship cuts through the darkness, the walls of water don't crush you; they stretch and unfold, revealing not destruction, but a meadow of grass stretching out beneath your feet. The ocean turns to solid earth, and as the ship sinks softly into the green grass, you stand up on the deck and wake up to the silence of your own room.
