**Dream Continuation:**  

The argument crackles like lightning under the amber glow of the streetlamp, its light flickering as if the world itself is holding its breath. You’re standing on the edge of the old stone bridge you once skipped stones across, now fractured by time and rain. Your friend, their voice sharp as glass, slams a hand on the railing. “You *knew* this would happen, didn’t you? You said you’d fix it!”  

You clutch your backpack tighter, the weight of it heavy with unspoken apologies. The air thickens, the scent of wet earth and ozone rising as if the sky itself is reacting. “It wasn’t *my* fault!” you snap back, your words echoing. “You left me no choice!”  

The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble—not from the argument, but from something else. The bridge groans, its stones shifting like molten glass, and suddenly you’re not on the bridge anymore. You’re in a dim, labyrinthine hallway you’ve never seen, walls lined with mirrors reflecting faces you’ve never recognized. Each reflection shows a version of you older, fractured, or weeping.  

Your friend’s voice follows you, distorted, as if coming from a distance: “You’re running again.” The hallway twists, and the mirrors now show the *same* reflection over and over—your face contorted in guilt, your chest heaving. A door at the end of the hall creaks open, revealing a courtyard bathed in moonlight. There, standing in the center, is your younger self, small and trembling, holding a letter you never sent.  

You freeze. The dream shifts: the argument dissolves into a whisper. Your friend’s hands reach out, not to attack, but to touch the letter in your younger self’s grip. “You were scared,” they say softly. “But fear doesn’t erase what you *could’ve* done.”  

The hallway dissolves into the bridge again. The rain has stopped. Your friend steps closer, their eyes no longer angry, just tired. “I’m not done with you,” they murmur, and for a heartbeat, the tension eases. You both laugh—a shaky, genuine sound—as the storm outside breaks, washing the air clean.  

Then, without warning, the bridge crumbles. You wake, gasping, back in your own bed. The dream’s gone, but the letter’s words linger: *“What if forgiveness isn’t a choice, but a leap?”* Outside your window, the first stars twinkle, unblinking, as if the universe itself is waiting to see if you’ll try.  

You don’t answer. Instead, you reach for the drawer by your bed, where the unopened letter waits, its edges frayed but the ink still bold. Somewhere in the silence, you hear your friend’s voice—gentle, persistent—as if they’re right there, urging you to turn the page.
