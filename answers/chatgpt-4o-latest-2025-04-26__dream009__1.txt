find a way to survive â€” and fast. The streets are dirt roads, the buildings made of rough stone and timber. Everyone wears simple clothes, and the smell of woodsmoke and baking bread fills the air. 

You pull your sleeves down over your modern-looking shirt and slip into the bustling crowd, trying not to stand out. A man hauling sacks of grain bumps into you, muttering an apology in a language you barely recognize but somehow *understand*.

Instinct tells you to find shelter first. You spot a gathering near the town square â€” a notice board covered in parchment and ink drawings. Maybe you could find work there, blend in, figure out where (and *when*) you are. But as you approach, something catches your eye: a wanted poster, with a rough sketch that looks **suspiciously** like *you*.

Your heart races. You have no idea what crime you're accused of, but you know you can't stand there gawking. You need a plan â€” and quickly.

Do you want to see what happens next? ðŸŒ™
