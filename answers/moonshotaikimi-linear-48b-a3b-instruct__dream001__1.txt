...run. Not out of panic, exactly—more like your body knows what your mind hasn’t caught up to yet. The sky is a strange violet, like it’s always sunset somewhere behind the clouds. Buildings skew sideways, their windows glinting like eyes trying not to blink. You’re barefoot on pavement that feels warm, almost humming.

A taxi–no, something between a bike and a boat–slams to a stop beside you. The driver is wearing a birdcage on his head as if it’s the most natural thing in the world. “Fifth quadrant,” he caws. “I know a shortcut.” You climb in, and suddenly the city folds: streets unravel like thread, archways become doors to places that shouldn’t exist, and you fly.  

You arrive with seconds to spare, but the building you’re supposed to be in is gone—only a reflection of yourself, standing in a doorframe that opens onto the stars. Your reflection smiles, hands you a key, and whispers, “You’re late for your own awakening.”
