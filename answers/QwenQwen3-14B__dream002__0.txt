You feel a storm approaching and the air crackles with an eerie energy. The once-vivid greens of the forest fade into deep, bruised purples as the sky fractures open, spilling silver lightning that illuminates skeletal trees bending like ancient, whispering sentinels. Rain doesn’t fall—it *shrieks*, slashing sideways in jagged threads that sting your skin. Yet, as the tempest rages, you notice the ground beneath your feet is no longer soil but a mosaic of glowing, interlocking tiles, each etched with symbols that pulse in time with your heartbeat.  

A figure emerges from the chaos—a tall, translucent being with antlers of fractured light and eyes like swirling galaxies. It doesn’t speak but extends a hand, and when you touch it, memories not your own flood your mind: a forgotten language, a key hidden in a hollow tree, a door that only appears when the world is “unmade.” The storm calms abruptly, leaving behind a forest transformed—trees now crystalline, their leaves humming with stolen thunder. The being vanishes, leaving only a single feather of shadow in its wake. You realize the storm wasn’t a threat… it was an invitation. And somewhere, deep in the crystalline woods, a door glows faintly, waiting.
