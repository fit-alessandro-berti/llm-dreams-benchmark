You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air grows heavy, charged with a low hum that vibrates in your bones. The trees, once rustling softly, now sway violently as if whispering secrets too ancient for human ears. Dark clouds spiral overhead, not with the gray of rain, but a deep, velvety indigo, speckled with stars that blink like tired eyes. The wind carries the scent of petrichor and something else—something metallic, like the breath of a forgotten god.  

A crack of lightning splits the sky, not with sound, but with a pulse that makes the ground tremble beneath your feet. The forest seems to hold its breath. Then, the rain falls—not in drops, but in shimmering threads of liquid silver, weaving through the air like threads of a tapestry. You raise your hands, and the droplets cling to your skin, their touch warm and alive, as if they remember you.  

Suddenly, the trees part, revealing a clearing where a figure stands, cloaked in shadows that ripple like smoke. Their face is obscured, but their voice echoes, not in the air, but in your mind: *“You’ve come to the edge of the dream where the real and the imagined bleed. What will you take with you?”*  

Before you can answer, the storm surges—a vortex of light and shadow spiraling upward, pulling the forest into its core. You feel yourself being lifted, not with fear, but with a strange, exhilarating weightlessness. The world dissolves into a kaleidoscope of memories and possibilities, and for a moment, you are everywhere and nowhere, a thread in the fabric of something vast and nameless.  

Then, as quickly as it began, the storm fades. You wake in the forest, but the trees now hum with a new rhythm, and the air smells of possibility. Somewhere, a bird calls, its song different—brighter, sharper, as if the world has been rewired. You don’t know if you’ve left the dream or simply stepped deeper into it. But the storm lingers, not in the sky, but in your chest, a quiet thunder that whispers, *“Remember.”*
