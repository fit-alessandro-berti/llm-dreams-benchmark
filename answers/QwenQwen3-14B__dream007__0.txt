You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you—a shared dream you once vowed to pursue together, now fractured by time and compromise. You decide to **storm out of the dimly lit café where you’d met, the clink of your coffee cup echoing as you slam your hand on the table**. But as you turn to leave, the world around you begins to warp: the walls melt into liquid gold, the street outside dissolves into a vast, starless sky, and your friend’s voice follows you, trembling with urgency.  

“You don’t get to walk away again!” they shout, their form flickering like a glitch in a video game. “We *both* gave up on that dream, remember? You stopped believing first!”  

You freeze, realizing the surreal landscape is a manifestation of your guilt—the unresolved ache of abandoning the project years ago when life got messy. Your friend’s eyes widen as they reach out, their hand passing through your chest, and suddenly you’re back in the café, the air thick with the scent of burnt coffee and regret.  

They collapse into the chair across from you, their voice quiet now. “I’ve been waiting for you to apologize. Not for the dream… for the *years* I thought you hated me for letting it go.”  

The room falls silent. Somewhere, a clock begins to tick backward. You reach for their hand, and in that moment, the dream shifts—no longer a fight, but a fragile truce, the unspoken promise to rebuild what was lost, even if it’s just a memory.  

Then, the alarm blares. You wake up, your pillow damp with tears, the echo of their voice still lingering: *“You didn’t walk away. You just got lost.”*
