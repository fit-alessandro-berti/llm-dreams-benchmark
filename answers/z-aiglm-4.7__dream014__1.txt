...feel a sudden, inexplicable sense of trust wash over you. You take their outstretched hands, and as you do, the overwhelming noise of the city—the screeching tires, the shouting, the sirens—fades into a gentle, rhythmic melody, like the hum of a lullaby.

As you walk together, the grey pavement beneath your feet softens into moss, and the towering skyscrapers dissolve into a canopy of silver-leafed trees that sparkle with starlight. You don't ask where you are going anymore; you don't need to. You simply move forward, the cold feeling of isolation evaporating into the air, replaced by the comforting certainty that you have finally found your people.
