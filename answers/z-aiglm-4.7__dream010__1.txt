As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and **the environment begins to warp around you.**

First, the conference room dissolves into a vast, shallow ocean. You are treading water, but instead of getting wet, you are dry and weightless. The other competitors are swimming past you on the backs of giant, floating staplers. Your task is to give a presentation on "Synergy," but every time you open your mouth, bubbles containing your childhood memories float out instead of words. You panic for a moment, realizing you forgot to wear shoes, but the water feels like warm velvet.

Suddenly, the scene shifts. You are now in a hallway that stretches forever in both directions. The walls are lined with thousands of clocks, all ticking at different speeds. A judge with the face of a lion and the body of a corporate executive hands you a Rubik’s Cube where the colors keep changing. "Solve for the quarterly projection," the lion-roars in a voice that sounds like static. You turn the cube, and it turns into a steaming cup of coffee. You take a sip, and it tastes like pure ambition.

For the final test, you are standing on a tightrope strung between two skyscrapers. The wind is howling, carrying newspapers with headlines about your future. Below you, the city is made of LEGOs. You have to walk backward to reach the finish line. With every step, the rope gets thinner, turning into a thread of light. You feel fear rising in your throat, but then you look up and see the moon. It is winking at you.

You take a leap of faith, trusting that the thread will hold. Instead of falling, you float upward. The Lion-Executive hands you a contract that glows with neon light. You sign it with a finger that turns into a quill, and the crowd below erupts into silence. You have won. You are the new CEO of the Universe. But just as you sit in the leather chair—which is actually a cloud—you realize you forgot to ask what the salary is, and the alarm clock begins to ring, sounding like a thousand church bells.
