You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **use your knowledge of modern medicine to treat a child’s feverish illness, but the villagers’ skepticism and superstitions threaten to strand you in this unfamiliar world**.  

The child’s fever burns with a strange, metallic pallor, unlike anything the locals have seen. You recall antipyretics and sterile bandages from your dreams—tools now as vital as a healer’s touch. But when you offer your “magic pills” and clean cloth, the elders whisper of “the foreigner who brings blight,” fearing your methods might summon darker forces. To survive, you must prove your worth while navigating the tightrope between trust and fear, and unravel whether the fever is a curse or a symptom of something far stranger than either world could imagine.
