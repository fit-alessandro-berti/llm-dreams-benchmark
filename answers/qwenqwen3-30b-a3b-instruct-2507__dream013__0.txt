...feel the air grow heavier, thick with the scent of old parchment and ozone. Each step echoes unnervingly in the silence, as if the stone walls themselves are holding their breath. 

You come to a chamber lined with shifting mirrors. In their reflective surfaces, you don't see your own face, but fragmented glimpses of other versions of yourself—some you’ve never seen, some looking terrified, others smiling with eerie confidence. The puzzle: *Align the mirrors so that only one reflection of you remains visible—your true self.*

But the mirrors don't respond to touch. Instead, a faint, melodic hum begins, and symbols appear in the air above each mirror: **Ω, Δ, ∞, ⊗**. You realize the solution isn't physical alignment—it's *conceptual*. You must *think* the correct sequence of reflections—*your truth, your doubt, your potential, your completion*—in your mind. As you focus, the symbols flicker and dissolve. For a tense second, you see only darkness. Then, in the center mirror, your own eyes stare back, calm and whole.

You step forward, and the wall before you dissolves into a river of liquid light. On the far bank, a door stands ajar, but instead of wood, it’s woven from threads of starlight and silence. The puzzle is written in a language you’ve never seen, but your mind translates it:  
**"To open this door, you must speak the single word that makes all answers vanish."**

You’re about to try—*perhaps “no”*—when a sound cuts through the dream: a child’s laughter, clear and bright, echoing from somewhere deep within the maze. It’s not part of the puzzle. It’s *outside* it. You freeze, heart pounding. That sound… it’s familiar. It’s *your* laughter from when you were five.  

The puzzle shimmers, then dissolves into thin air. The river of light flows backward. The mirrors vanish. The maze doesn’t collapse—it *unravels*, like a tapestry pulled thread by thread.

And then you wake… not in bed, but standing in your childhood backyard on a rain-slicked summer evening. The sky is streaked with violet clouds. There’s a swing set creaking gently, and on the porch, a small, barefoot figure—*you*, five years old—sitting on the steps, looking out at the woods.  

You realize, with a shiver that isn’t cold: *You weren’t the dreamer. You were the dream.*  

And the puzzle wasn’t meant to be solved…  
It was meant to be *remembered.*
