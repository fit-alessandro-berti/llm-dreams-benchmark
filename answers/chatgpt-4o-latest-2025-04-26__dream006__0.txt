speak, but no sound comes out. You clear your throat and try again—still nothing. A low hum fills the room, and the faces in the audience start to blur and melt together, like candle wax under a hot flame. 

Panicking, you look down at your notes, but the words have rearranged themselves into a language you don’t recognize. Your palms are sweaty; the paper crumples in your shaking hands. Suddenly, from the back of the room, a soft, familiar voice calls your name. 

You look up—and there, walking down the aisle, is someone you thought you had lost a long time ago. They smile warmly, and the entire room brightens, colors becoming vivid and swirling like a living painting. The audience fades away until it's just the two of you standing there. 

The person reaches out, touches your hand, and finally, you find your voice. You begin to speak—not with words, but with pure feeling, a song that rises from your chest and fills the endless space around you.

Would you like me to continue from there?
