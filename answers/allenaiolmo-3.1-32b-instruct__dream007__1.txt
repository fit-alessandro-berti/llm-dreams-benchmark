take a deep breath and pause, feeling the tension in the air between you. You realize that your voice has risen without you noticing, and frustration is clouding your thoughts. You search for the words that might help, remembering all the good times you've shared and how much this person means to you. With effort, you soften your tone and say, "I'm really sorry—I can see how much this matters to you, and I don't want us to end up on opposite sides. Can we try to understand each other's perspective?" Your friend looks at you, and for a moment, the anger in their eyes fades. The room feels a little less heavy as you both take a step back, ready to listen, hoping to find a way through the disagreement that strengthens your friendship instead of breaking it.
