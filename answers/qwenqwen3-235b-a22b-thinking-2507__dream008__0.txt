The sentence hangs—*and you—*—as if the dream itself is gasping for air. Here’s how it unfolds, raw and surreal, just like a true nightmare:  

---

You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you **look down at your hands—they’re covered in ink, the kind that stains your skin blue and won’t wash off. The deadline isn’t tomorrow. It’s *yesterday*. A digital clock on your desk screams **−00:00:03** in red, bleeding pixels.**  

You try to open your laptop, but the keyboard is sticky with honey. Flies buzz around your monitor, spelling out *"TOO LATE"* in their flight patterns. Your boss—now three floating heads stacked like a human totem pole—leans in, their voices overlapping:  
*“The client expects the moon. Literally. We need lunar soil analysis by 9 AM. And… your chair is gone.”*  

You glance down. Your office chair *has* vanished. You’re hovering six inches above the floor, kicking helplessly. Around you, coworkers type furiously on typewriters made of ice, their fingers turning frostbitten. One whispers, *“Don’t panic. Panic makes the walls melt.”* Sure enough, the office partitions are dripping like wax candles, forming puddles of lukewarm coffee.  

You sprint for the supply closet—maybe there’s a spare chair, a time machine, *anything*—but the hallway stretches endlessly, doors multiplying like a funhouse mirror. Your shoes fill with sand. The clock’s countdown now reads **−00:00:01**, and the fly swarm morphs into a tiny, winged version of your boss, holding a ruler like a sword.  

*“Just hit SEND!”* the heads yell. You lunge for your keyboard, but your fingers pass *through* the keys. The screen floods with error messages:  
🚨 **`REALITY OVERFLOW`**  
🚨 **`DEADLINE EXISTED YESTERDAY`**  
🚨 **`YOUR SOUL IS 37% DONE`**  

You pound the desk—and your hand sinks *into* the wood like wet clay. Pulling it out, you clutch not a wrist, but a single, perfect white seashell. It hums with the sound of a dial-up modem. The heads sigh in unison: *“Well. At least you tried.”*  

Then—  
***  
—you jolt awake in your own bed, heart hammering. Sunlight streams through the window. Your phone buzzes: a calendar alert for a *real* meeting in 20 minutes. Sweat soaks your shirt. You laugh, shaky and relieved—until you notice your palms are still faintly blue.  

And on your nightstand, glittering in the morning light: a single grain of sand.  

---  

Dreams twist logic into emotional truth. That deadline? It’s never about work—it’s the quiet scream of *"I’m not enough, not fast enough, not ready."* But here’s the secret: **you woke up**. The sand washes off. The meeting is survivable. Breathe. You’re already ahead of *yesterday*. 💙
