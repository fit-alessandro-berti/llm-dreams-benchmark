…learn the rules of this place before it decides what to do with you.

The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth. A bell tolls somewhere beyond the hedgerows, slow and iron-throated, gathering people you do not know for reasons you cannot guess. You touch your pocket out of habit and find only a smooth pebble, warm as if it has been held for a very long time. The trees lean in, eavesdropping.

A cart rattles by, the driver giving you a quick, measuring glance. His clothes are homespun and patched, his horse a sway-backed philosopher with patient eyes. You flash him a smile, a small bow—a universal currency. He tips his cap. You have the sense of stepping onto a stage where the play has already begun and your lines are handwritten in invisible ink.

You follow the sound of the bell to a square where a well stands like a stern grandmother. Women in linen aprons trade gossip the way hawks trade currents. Children play a game with knucklebones, sing a song whose melody feels like something you used to know. When they catch you watching, they go quiet, as if you have said something out loud with your face.

You need to ask questions without looking like you’re asking questions. You need to find out who is missing so you can pretend to be them. You need to learn the price of bread, the way people say hello, which saints they trust and what they do with their dead. You need to avoid the sort of mistake that turns a stranger into a story.

An old man sits on a stool beside the well, whittling a stick into a spiral. He squints up at you. “Lost?” he asks, not unkindly.

“Between here and somewhere else,” you say, because the truth is the only thing you have that fits.

He grunts, then pats the stone next to him. “Then sit where everyone passes. They’ll show you what they are. You can borrow it, until you find your own.”

So you sit. You learn that the bread is coarse and yesterday is folded into today. That greetings begin with the weather and end with a blessing. That the bell tolled because a calf was born, slippery and shining, a good omen for the harvest. A woman presses a piece of honeycomb into your hand in exchange for a joke you barely remember, and just like that you have a small, sticky passport.

You volunteer to carry buckets from the well to the baker’s door. The rope burns your palms in a way that feels honest. The baker’s oven breathes heat like a dragon ready to sign a treaty. You help the fieldhands turn the hay, fall into their rhythm, the scythe’s whisper cutting the afternoon into strips.

At night, the village gathers in a longhouse, smoke weaving patterns in the rafters. A fiddler coaxes stories out of four strings. You keep your mouth shut unless you can add a harmless detail. You store faces and names the way birds store paths in their bones.

You need to make a map of what is forbidden. There’s a grove on the hill that the children won’t run through. There’s a story about a hag who bargains fairly, which means she does not bargain at all. There’s a priest who smiles with too many teeth. There’s a stone with a hole in it they touch before crossing the bridge. You do the same. No one points. The stone hums like a tuning fork against your palm, or maybe it’s your blood.

Days accordion. Your hands learn the language of knots. Your ears learn the distance of thunder. Your mouth learns the names of herbs: yarrow, comfrey, saint’s wort. You tell someone your name and they repeat it slowly, turning it into something their tongues can keep.

When autumn arrives with its copper coins of leaves, the old man by the well brings you the spiral he carved that first day. “For luck,” he says. “Or for remembering a thing when it tries to forget itself.”

You hold it up to the moon and see that sometimes the only way forward is in circles. You have learned enough to almost belong and enough to know you never will. Still, when the bell tolls again—two soft, one hard—you stand with the others and run, carrying buckets, prayers, laughter, your borrowed self.

Later, alone, you lie on a straw mattress that whispers in the language of mice. You turn the spiral in your fingers until the world inside you lines up with the one outside. You need to sleep now, to start over in the morning, to keep learning the rules until they loosen like knots in warm water.

You close your eyes and the hedgerows breathe. Somewhere far away a train passes, though there are no tracks here, and you can almost remember what it felt like to wake up where you began.
