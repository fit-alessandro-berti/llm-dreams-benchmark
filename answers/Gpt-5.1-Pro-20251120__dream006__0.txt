…and you begin to speak, but no sound comes out.

Your mouth moves, your throat works, but the auditorium is filled only with the soft buzz of the overhead lights and the faint rustle of clothes as hundreds of people lean forward, waiting.

A hot, familiar panic rises.

You clear your throat. Try again.

Nothing.

Someone in the front row frowns and checks their watch. A woman near the aisle lifts her phone, already recording, expecting brilliance or disaster. You feel that old school-nightmare sensation: the sense that you missed something, that everyone else got the memo and you didn’t.

You look down at your notes for help—

But the paper is blank.

Not even a title. Just a pale square of possibility, accusing you with its emptiness.

Your heartbeat thunders in your ears. You think, *This is a dream,* but that thought is slippery, like a word on the tip of your tongue. The spotlights are hot on your face; you can’t see the back of the room, only darkness, and in that darkness shapes seem to shift and breathe.

You try one more time, forcing the words out.

A single sound escapes you, but it is not a word.

It’s a bell.

Clear, bright—*ding*—like a glass being tapped at a wedding. It rings out through the hall, hanging in the air, and every single person in the audience hears it.

They all exhale together, as if they’d been holding their breath.

You freeze. You didn’t mean to do that. But the sound felt… right. Almost like your voice, but sideways.

You open your mouth again.

This time, a different sound emerges—a low hum, like a distant choir blended with a train on faraway tracks. It vibrates through your chest and down your arms. The stage beneath your feet ripples subtly, as if it were water pretending to be wood.

You look at your hands.

Tiny wildflowers are growing from the lines of your palms, blooming in fast-forward. Petals unfurl, colors you don’t have names for, and a soft, impossible breeze carries their scent out toward the crowd.

Instead of recoiling, the audience leans in closer.

Someone in the third row begins to laugh—not mockingly, but with delighted surprise. A child near the aisle claps their hands, eyes huge. The stern-looking person with the watch smiles despite themselves.

You realize something: they weren’t waiting to hear your *speech*.

They were waiting to see what you would *do*.

The fear loosens its grip on you, just a little.

You look back at the blank paper in your hand. As you watch, ink begins to crawl across it in looping handwriting that isn’t quite yours and yet unmistakably is. The words rearrange themselves faster than you can read them:

> “You do not have to know what to say before you begin saying it.”

You laugh, and this time the sound comes out as your actual voice, warm and surprisingly steady, layered faintly with that bell-tone underneath.

You speak without looking at the paper.

“You’re all waiting,” you say, “for me to remember something I’ve never learned.”

The sentence doesn’t make logical sense, but in the dream it feels perfectly true. Heads nod in the front row. Someone whispers, “Yes.”

You continue.

You talk about the first time you were afraid to raise your hand in class, and the way you practiced being brave in empty rooms when no one was watching. You talk about the secret belief that everyone else has a script and you’re the only one improvising. As the words spill out, they turn into small, shining birds that drift gently from your lips, circle above the audience, and settle on people’s shoulders.

Each time a bird lands, its feathers dissolve into light and sink into the person’s chest. Their faces change: tightness softens, eyes clear, shoulders drop.

You notice that the audience isn’t really strangers. In the shifting half-light, you glimpse familiar profiles: the teacher who embarrassed you once; the friend you haven’t called in years; the barista who always spells your name wrong; a version of yourself at twelve, at nineteen, at the exact age you are now.

They are all listening to you.

Your knees stop shaking.

You throw away the paper. It turns into a flock of white moths midair and disappears into the stage lights.

You walk away from the podium. No microphone, no barrier—just you and them. Your steps make no sound, but flowers bloom in your footprints, then fade like ink soaking into a page.

You say, “I thought I was here to prove I’m not afraid.”

You look around at hundreds of faces, all turned toward you, all more open than they were a moment ago.

“But I think,” you say slowly, the dream becoming lucid around your words, “I’m here to show myself that it’s okay to be afraid *and* speak anyway.”

As you say it, the walls of the auditorium begin to peel back like stage scenery, rolling away to reveal a vast, star-filled sky where the ceiling used to be. The night above you isn’t dark—it’s deep and soft, like velvet lit from within. The stars blink in time with your heartbeat.

Wind moves through the crowd, lifting hair, rustling clothes, carrying faint echoes of other speeches you’ve never given and might still give someday.

Someone in the back starts to applaud.

Then another.

Then the entire room rises to its feet, applauding not wildly but steadily, like rain on a roof—gentle but insistent. It’s not the applause of people who have watched a flawless performance. It’s the sound people make when they recognize something of themselves in what they’ve just seen.

Your throat tightens, but this time with something like gratitude.

You bow—awkwardly at first, then with an easy, dreamlike grace—and as you straighten, the stage lights flare into a soft white that washes everything out.

For a moment, there is only brightness.

Then you feel the edge of your mattress under your fingers.

Your eyes open to your actual ceiling, quiet and ordinary in the dim light of your room. Your heart is still beating a little fast. You lie there, feeling the ghost of the audience’s applause in your chest, like an echo that hasn’t quite faded.

You don’t remember every word of the speech, of course.

But the feeling—that you began anyway, that the blank page filled itself once you stepped forward—that lingers like the afterimage of a star when you close your eyes.

For a long moment, you just breathe.

And somewhere, in the part of you that’s still half-dreaming, you realize:

The next time you have to speak up in your waking life, it might begin the same way—

With nothing prepared.

With your heart pounding.

And with the quiet, impossible knowledge that you’ve already practiced this, somewhere, on a stage that opened into the sky.
