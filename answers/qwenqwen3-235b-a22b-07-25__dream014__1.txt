You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you hesitantly accept.  

The first to step forward is an elderly woman with silver hair woven through with tiny lights like fireflies. She presses a small compass into your palm—the needle spins wildly, then settles, not pointing north, but toward the sound of distant music. "It won't show you where you *are*," she says with a knowing smile, "but where you *need* to go."  

Next, a child tugs your sleeve, holding out a pair of worn paper slippers. "These’ll keep the noise away," they whisper. "The city likes to rattle your thoughts, but you don’t have to listen." As you slip them on, the roar of traffic and chatter hushes into a gentle hum, like waves on a faraway shore.  

A man in a faded coat joins you, silently handing you a sandwich wrapped in old newspaper. The warmth seeps into your hands. "You won’t be found until you’re fed," he says simply. The first bite tastes like your grandmother’s kitchen—something you haven’t thought of in years.  

Together, they walk with you through winding alleys that shimmer with unexpected greenery—ivy climbing lampposts, flowers sprouting from cracks. The streets begin to feel less alien, even familiar. With every step, your chest lightens. You’re still not sure where you’re going, but for the first time, you don’t fear the unknown.  

Then the city begins to fade at the edges, the buildings softening into mist—and you realize this journey isn’t about reaching a destination, but about remembering you’re never truly alone.  

As dawn bleeds through the dream, you wake with the compass in your real hand, still warm, its needle gently pulsing, as if keeping time with your heart.
