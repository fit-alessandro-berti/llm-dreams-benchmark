Certainly! Here's a continuation of the dream:

---

You step onto the stage, the spotlight blinding, your voice trembling as you open your mouth to speak. The crowd’s expectant silence feels like a physical weight. Suddenly, the podium beneath your hands begins to levitate, rising slowly into the air. The audience gasps—not in awe, but in unison, their faces melting into blurred, featureless masks. 

Panicking, you grasp the edges of the podium, but instead of wood, it’s now made of liquid glass, cool and viscous. Your speech notes dissolve into ash as you try to read them. Behind you, the stage backdrop unravels like a scroll, revealing a starry sky. A voice echoes—not yours, not anyone’s—whispering, *“The truth is in the silence.”* 

You close your eyes, and when you open them, the crowd is gone. In their place stands a single figure, cloaked in shadows, holding a mirror that reflects not your face, but a swirling galaxy. The podium drops gently to the floor. You take a breath and speak anyway, your words echoing as if in a cathedral. To your surprise, the mirror shatters into constellations, each fragment floating upward, spelling out a phrase in glowing letters: *“To dream is to be heard.”* 

You wake with the taste of stardust on your tongue, the echo of your own voice still ringing in your ears.
