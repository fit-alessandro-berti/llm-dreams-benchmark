### ...find yourself unfolding into a warm embrace of light and purpose  

As the strangers gather around you — their faces glowing with a soft, golden hue — you feel the cold stone beneath your feet begin to melt into something softer, almost sentient. They don’t just point you toward your destination; they *become* the path. One by one, they extend hands, linking arms in a quiet, unspoken chain that pulls you forward — not with force, but with an invitation you can’t refuse.  

You hesitate at first, still wrapped in the quiet scream of loneliness, but their eyes hold no judgment — only understanding. One of them, a woman with skin like aged mahogany and hair that swirls like dark water, whispers, *“You were never lost. You were only waiting to be seen.”*  

And then, just as you begin to walk with them, the city transforms. The towering buildings fold inward like origami, becoming trees with glass leaves that chime in the wind. The crowded streets empty, not into silence, but into a symphony — birdsong, distant laughter, the soft hum of something ancient and alive.  

You look down and notice your footsteps are no longer leaving marks on the ground. Instead, each step blooms into a small, glowing flower — delicate, fleeting, but persistent. The strangers smile, and one by one, they begin to fade, not disappearing completely, but dissolving into motes of light that drift into the air like fireflies.  

You are no longer alone. You are *guided*. And as the light lifts you — not lifting you off the ground, but lifting your spirit — you understand: the help wasn’t just about direction. It was about remembrance.  

You remember that you are not lost.  
You are *returning*.
