...and you reach for your keyboard, but the keys have turned into soft, rhythmic piano notes that play a somber melody every time you try to type. You look up at your boss, but his face is blurring like a watercolor painting in the rain. He isn't speaking words anymore; he’s handing you a stack of translucent papers that contain the blueprints for a city made entirely of echoes.

"We need the foundations laid before the sun finishes setting," he says, but his voice sounds like it’s coming from the bottom of a deep well.

You look at your watch, but the hands are spinning counter-clockwise, faster and faster, until they fly off the face and transform into two silver moths that flutter toward the ceiling. The office walls begin to stretch upward, the fluorescent lights turning into a row of pale, hanging moons. 

You realize you aren't wearing shoes. Your feet are submerged in three inches of cool, clear water that has begun to seep from the baseboards. Despite the pressure, a strange calm washes over you. You pick up a pen, but instead of ink, it writes in threads of pure light.

You don't start the report. Instead, you begin to knit the light into a ladder.

The boss watches, his features finally settling into the face of an old friend you haven't seen in years. He nods once, turns into a shadow, and slips under the door. You climb. As you reach the ceiling, the tiles dissolve into a vast, violet nebula. The deadline no longer matters because, in this space, "time" is just a word you've forgotten the meaning of. 

You take a step into the stars, and the office—the project, the desk, the impossible clock—simply dissolves into the sound of a distant, ringing bell. 

The dream shifts. You are no longer working. You are flying.
