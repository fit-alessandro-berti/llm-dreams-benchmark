The air thickens with the tang of ozone, and the once-dappled sunlight fractures into jagged shadows as clouds swallow the sky. Trees bend like old bones, their leaves hissing secrets in a language you almost recognize. A crack of lightning splits the horizon, and in its afterglow, you see them: *figures* woven from the storm itself, their bodies rippling with rain, their eyes flickering like distant stars.  

The ground quivers, roots erupting to form a bridge over a sudden chasm that splits the earth. The wind pushes you forward, urgent and insistent, as droplets of rain freeze midair, becoming prismatic portals reflecting impossible worlds—a city of inverted spires, a desert where shadows sing, a shore lapped by a black sea.  

One of the storm-figures reaches out, a hand of crackling static. Its touch doesn’t shock; it *unspools* you. Memories flare—a childhood fear of thunder, the smell of your first love’s hair, a forgotten promise—all while the forest dissolves into a labyrinth of mirrors. In each reflection, a version of you stares back, older, younger, fiercer, broken.  

A crow lands on your shoulder, its feathers slick with rain. “*Choose,*” it croaks, not with its beak, but with the voice of someone you once mourned. The storm stills, suspended, as the mirrors converge into a single door—weathered oak, iron hinges weeping rust. Behind it, a low hum thrums in time with your heartbeat.  

You reach for the handle.  

Then you wake.  

(Or do you?)
