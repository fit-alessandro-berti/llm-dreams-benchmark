You start to panic—your pulse thrums in your ears, drowning out the city’s hum. The buildings loom like fractured teeth, their windows reflecting a sky that shifts from bruised purple to sickly green. Street signs blur as you pass them, ink bleeding into gibberish. *Where am I even supposed to go?*  

You spot an old woman feeding pigeons in a shadowed alley. Her eyes, milky but sharp, lock onto yours. "Lost, dear?" she croaks. Before you can speak, she tosses a crumpled map at your feet. It’s drawn on what looks like *your own palm*, the lines pulsing faintly.  

Suddenly, your phone buzzes—a notification you’ve never seen before: **"Meeting Location: The Clock Without Hands. 47 minutes remaining."**  

The alley stretches impossibly long behind her. At its end, a clocktower pierces the clouds… but its face is smooth, blank. No hands. No numbers. Just a gaping mouth of stone.  

You run.  

The streets twist like a labyrinth of mirrors. Neon signs flicker: *"Turn Left at Regret," "Beware of Echoes," "Your Past is This Way."* Your reflection in a shop window winks—*you* didn’t do that. Rain begins to fall, but the droplets hover mid-air, trembling.  

Then, a scent cuts through the static: ozone and burnt sugar. You remember—*the meeting isn’t at the clocktower. It’s inside you.* The map on your palm glows hotter, burning through skin to reveal coordinates etched in bone: **00:00.**  

The city shudders. Buildings fold inward like closing fists. The ground softens to liquid shadow beneath your feet. And the voice that whispers *"You’re late"*… sounds exactly like your own.  

---  
*You wake with a gasp, your palm tingling. On your nightstand, your phone reads: **00:00**.*
