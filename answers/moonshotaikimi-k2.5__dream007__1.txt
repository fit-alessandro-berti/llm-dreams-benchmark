…**open the window**, even though you’re on the thirtieth floor and the glass has fused to the frame with something that looks like dried honey. You need the air because the words you’ve been throwing back and forth have begun to solidify in the space between you—harsh, jagged nouns hovering like hornets, adjectives condensing into a gray fog that tastes of copper pennies.

Your friend reaches out to stop you, but their hand passes *through* your shoulder, and you remember, with the sudden logic of dreams, that you’ve been arguing about a map you both drew when you were twelve—a map to a place that doesn’t exist on any earth, but which you buried in a time capsule that is simultaneously under the oak tree in your childhood backyard and inside the ribcage of the whale you saw last summer at the maritime museum.

“I’m going to find it without you,” you say, but your voice comes out as your mother’s voice, and then as the sound of a train whistle.

You step through the window. Instead of falling, you sink. The glass ripples like water, and the street below rushes up not as pavement but as pages—thousands of pages from a diary you don’t remember writing, fluttering upward to catch you. Your friend is still in the room, but the room is now a reflection in a spoon, and they are shrinking, or you are growing, or the argument is simply becoming too small to hold in one hand anymore.

You catch one of the pages. On it, in your friend’s handwriting but your blood (which looks like ink, which looks like rain), it says: *I was never angry about the map. I was angry because you left the door open, and the dark got in.*

You want to call back to them, to say you’ll close it, you’ll lock it, you’ll swallow the key, but the wind takes the words and weaves them into birds that fly back toward the spoon, back toward the room, back toward the thirtieth floor where your friend is now waiting, not arguing, just holding two cups of coffee that are somehow still hot, steam rising in the shape of an apology.

You land softly. The pages settle. The argument is a pebble in your pocket now, smooth and cool, and when you look up, the window is closed, the glass is clear, and your friend is offering you the left-hand cup.

You take it. The coffee tastes like waking up.
