The world around me shifts unnoticed — tangles of cobbled streets, the hum of distant horse hooves echoing through narrow alleys, gas lamps casting golden shadows on oxidized stone. I look around, bewildered. This isn’t my time. My hands tremble, not from fear but curiosity. What am I? Is it ancient history, or something entirely forgotten?

I approach a small, metal contraption — a brass watch, its gears clicking softly to life. It ticks once — was that a bird? a machine? Its rhythm pulses with purpose. I reach out, and it clangs against my palm. It *speaks* in a soft, mechanical voice: “Time is measured differently here. You must learn its rhythm.”

I remember reading about past eras — steam engines, telegraphs, letters rushed across chalkboards. But here, there are no machines, no signals, no clocks. Only the wind in the streets and the weight of the past beneath me. I realize I must act fast.

I gather dry sticks and twigs, crafting a fire with firewood. The flames dance and crackle, casting flickering shadows on the stone walls. Perhaps this land once flourished with such technology. Or perhaps it was more… organic?

As night falls, I sit by the fire, listening to the distant wind. The world feels both ancient and fragile. I glance at my hands — they are no longer clutching a phone. But my heart is full of questions.

**What now?** Do I rebuild this forgotten world? Seek connection with a hidden past? Or am I just beginning to understand the chaos of a life not yet lived?

Sleepily, I drift into dreams, surrounded by the echoes of history and the whisper of the unknown.
