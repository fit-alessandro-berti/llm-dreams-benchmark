…accept their offer with a grateful smile. Moving through the colorful streets together, you realize the city isn’t as intimidating as it first seemed. The strangers each tell you a bit about themselves—one is a street musician, another, a pastry chef, and the third, an artist who sketches the city’s stories on scraps of napkin.

As you follow your newfound friends, the city transforms: neon signs flicker into stars overhead, and the pavement beneath your feet feels like a soft carpet. Every building’s window glows invitingly, and the air smells faintly of cinnamon and coffee.

At last, you reach a narrow alleyway draped with strings of lanterns. The group stops outside a small café you hadn’t noticed before. “You’re not lost,” one of them assures you. “You just hadn’t found us yet.” They open the café door, and a warm, golden light spills out, welcoming you home.

Inside, laughter bubbles and music lilts through the air. You realize you’ve forgotten what you were looking for—but you’ve found something better: belonging.
