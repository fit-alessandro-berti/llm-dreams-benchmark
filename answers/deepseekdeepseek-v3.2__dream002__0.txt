You feel a storm approaching, and the air grows heavy with the scent of ozone and damp earth. The canopy above you begins to thrash, and the first cold drops of rain strike your skin, sharp as pebbles.

Instead of running for shelter, you feel a strange pull deeper into the woods. The wind seems to whisper your name, not in a frightening way, but with a curious urgency. You follow the pull, your feet finding a hidden path you hadn't noticed before, lined with glowing moss that pulses with a soft, blue light.

As the storm breaks in earnest—thunder booming, rain sheeting down—you arrive at a clearing. In the center stands an ancient, massive tree, its bark silver in the erratic lightning flashes. At its base is a dry, hollow space, like a small cave. Inside, it’s warm and quiet, the roar of the storm muted to a distant rumble.

Sitting there, waiting for you, is a fox with eyes like liquid amber. It nods as if expecting you, and then it speaks, not with a mouth, but directly into your mind.

“You felt the turn,” it says. “The storm outside is just a mirror. The one you need to weather is within. But here, for now, you are safe. Listen.”

And so you sit with the fox, watching the lightning illuminate the forest in snapshots of violet and white, listening to the rain drum on the earth. You realize you are not afraid. The chaos outside makes the peace within the tree feel sacred, earned. The fox rests its head on its paws, and you understand, without words, that this calm is yours to keep when you wake.
