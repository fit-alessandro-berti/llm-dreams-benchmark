As you move deeper into the maze, you begin to notice that the puzzles are shifting in nature. They no longer demand just logic, but also intuition and emotion. The walls around you seem to pulse with your heartbeat, and with each solved puzzle, a piece of the maze dissolves into mist, revealing glimpses of a distant reality. You realize that the maze is your own subconscious, and the only way out is to confront the final puzzle—the meaning of the dream itself. With a deep breath, you step forward, and the world around you unravels into light. You wake, the lingering sense of discovery still warm in your mind.
