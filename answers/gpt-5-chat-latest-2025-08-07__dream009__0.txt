…adapt quickly if you want to survive. The air smells of woodsmoke and damp soil, and the distant sound of hammering echoes from what must be a blacksmith’s forge. You spot people in coarse woolen tunics, carrying baskets of grain and leading goats along a narrow dirt road. No one is holding a phone, no electric hum fills the air—only the rhythm of footsteps, chatter, and the wind through the trees.

You realize you need to **blend in** to avoid suspicion. Your clothes—strange, colorful fabrics from the future—draw curious stares. A child tugs at their mother’s sleeve, whispering about "the odd traveler." You smooth your hair, pulling your jacket tightly around you, and consider your next actions.

Your stomach growls—food is a priority. Then again… a strange pull in your chest suggests something else is going on. You feel as if you’ve been sent here for a *reason*, though you don’t yet know what.

You have three choices:  
1. **Head toward the village market** to barter for clothes and food.  
2. **Find a quiet spot** on the outskirts to observe and learn without drawing attention.  
3. **Follow the sound of hammers** toward the blacksmith’s—as if it’s calling to you.

Which do you choose?
