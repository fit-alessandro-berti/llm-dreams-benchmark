You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to *survive*. The air is crisp, carrying the smoky tang of wood fires and the earthy scent of damp moss. The sky is a deeper blue than you remember, the sun a golden disk that seems to hover lower in the sky. You’re standing in what looks like a medieval village—wooden huts with thatched roofs, cobblestone streets, and villagers in tunics and cloaks moving about with purpose.  

Your first thought is panic, but it quickly shifts to curiosity. How did you get here? Are you dreaming, or has time itself unraveled? You notice a figure watching you from a distance—a woman with sharp eyes and a weathered face, her hands busy weaving baskets. She nods at you, then walks away, leaving you to wonder if she’s hostile or if she knows something.  

You realize you need to *blend in*. Your modern clothes—jeans, a t-shirt, and a hoodie—are stark against the muted hues of the era. You spot a nearby stream and decide to start with water. But as you approach, a child wails and runs toward you, followed by a farmer who shouts, “*Out of my way, stranger!*” The villagers are suspicious, their distrust a wall you’ll need to climb.  

Your next priority is *finding shelter*. You spot a lone hut on the edge of the village, its door ajar. Inside, you find a hearth, a few tools, and a map etched into a wooden plank. The map shows symbols you don’t recognize—maybe a guide to something, or a warning. As you study it, a knock at the door. The woman from before stands there, her gaze steady. “You’re not from here,” she says. “But you’re not a threat. Come, if you want to stay.”  

You follow her, and she leads you to a hidden chamber beneath the village, where ancient tomes and strange diagrams line the walls. “This place is dying,” she explains. “The river’s poisoned, the crops are failing… and the king’s men are hunting those who know the old ways.” She offers you a choice: help her restore the village’s forgotten magic, or find a way back to your time.  

Will you trust her? Or will you risk everything to unravel the mystery of how you got here?
