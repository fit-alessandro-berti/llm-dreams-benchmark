you walk away—only to find the room fading around the edges, like stepping through a veil. The argument dissolves, the voices distant. Somewhere beyond the blur, you see your friend standing by a window, rain smearing the glass. You don’t turn back. Instead, you reach into the pocket of your coat—your journal. On the first page, annotated in their handwriting, you read: *“I didn’t realize you felt that way until now.”*  

Your breath catches. The words aren’t words at all, but a memory—shared, never spoken. You reach out, and their hand brushes yours, faint but real. The rain slows. For a moment, the distance between you isn’t gaping.  

You speak, quietly:  
“I missed you. Not just the fights, not just the words—but the part of me that never stopped caring.”  

And then the world softens, like fog lifting. The argument fades. But not with words. With understanding.  

You don’t move to stay. You just… return.
