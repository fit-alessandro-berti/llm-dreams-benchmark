You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to open your mouth to deliver your carefully prepared opening line. But instead of your voice, a chorus of birdsong fills the hall. The audience gasps in delight, and you look down to see your hands transforming into wings. As you take flight above the crowd, you realize you are dreaming, and a sense of freedom washes over you just before you awaken.
