…you feel a storm approaching *and* something else: a low, rhythmic thrum beneath your feet, like a distant drumbeat or a heartbeat made of stone and wind. The trees around you—once still and silver-barked—begin to sway *against* the wind, slowly at first, then in eerie unison, as if remembering an ancient choreography. Their leaves ripple like scales, turning upside-down in a silent, synchronized flip.

You stop walking. A cold wind curls around your neck, but not from the sky—it’s coming *up* from the ground. You hear it then: not thunder, but a low, sharpened *whisper*, layered with voices you don’t recognize, speaking in a language that feels older than memory. The air thickens, tasting of iron and moss and something burning.

Suddenly, the path beneath your feet splits—not into branches, but *into eyes*. A ring of them, half-buried in the forest floor, all staring at you. The wind stops. The trees stop moving. The world holds its breath.

From the center of the ring, the earth begins to *rise*. Slowly, like a fist pushing up from the planet’s palm. A single, smooth obsidian obelisk emerges, slick and humming. On its surface, your name—*your* name, even though no one here should know it—burns faintly in letters that shift like smoke.

And then the storm breaks. But not with rain. With *light*. Not lightning, but *words*. They fall from the sky like glowing seeds, flaring open in the air above you. Each one bearing a memory you’ve never lived—your face in a mirror that isn’t yours, your voice speaking in a tongue you’ve never learned, your hands holding a child you’ve never seen.

You realize the forest isn’t forest at all. It’s a memory of a forest. A memory *waiting* for you to dream it awake. And the words falling from the sky aren’t warnings. They’re *invitations*.
