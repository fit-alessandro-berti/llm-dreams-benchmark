blend in to avoid suspicion. The clothes you are wearing stand out—far too modern for this time period—so you quickly search for something more appropriate. You find an abandoned cottage near the edge of a forest and slip inside, discovering a set of simple, homespun garments. After changing, you step back outside and take in your surroundings.

The air smells fresh, untouched by pollution. Horses and wooden carts move along a dirt road in the distance, while villagers engage in daily chores. You overhear snippets of conversation in a language that sounds similar to your own but with strange, old-fashioned inflections. It dawns on you—you’ve woken up in the past.

But where exactly are you? And more importantly, how did you get here?

As you wander through the village, you spot a gathering near the town square. A man in heavy robes stands on a raised platform, reading aloud from a parchment. Words like "royal decree" and "new laws" reach your ears, but before you can make sense of them, someone taps your shoulder.

“You’re not from around here, are you?” a voice whispers.

You turn to see a young woman with piercing eyes and an expression of quiet curiosity. She gestures for you to follow her into a nearby alleyway.

“If you want to survive,” she says in a hushed tone, “you need to listen carefully. You don’t belong in this time—and they will notice.” 

Your heart pounds. Who is she? And how does she know the truth about you?

Before you can ask, the sound of approaching footsteps fills the alley. The woman’s eyes widen.

“They’re already looking for you,” she says. “You have to decide now—run, or trust me.” 

What do you do?
