each one feels tailored to some forgotten corner of you. One round has you sprinting down an endless corridor of filing cabinets, each drawer a memory; you have to find the one that holds your first spark of ambition before the corridor floods with ankle‑deep water that smells like coffee. In another, you stand on a stage before judges whose faces keep flickering between your old teachers and your current friends, and you're asked to explain why the moon looks the way it does in a language you've never heard of. You open your mouth and out come colored ribbons that spell the answer.

When they send you to an obstacle course, the obstacles are made of red tape that literally sticks to your clothes and slows you down. You tear through it, laughing, because suddenly you can stretch yourself thin as a beam of light and slip through the smallest gaps. In the creative round, you're given a brush and a canvas the size of the sky and told to paint your résumé without using words; your hands move and constellations form.

With each success the number of contestants around you dwindles until it's just you and a mirrored version of yourself in the final room. The last task is deceptively simple: a pedestal, a locked box, and a key hanging around your own neck. You reach up, but the mirror self moves first, and you realize you both have to turn the key together.

As you do, the box opens to reveal not a contract or badge, but a small, warm light that leaps into your chest. The walls of the competition hall fall away. You're suddenly standing in an office, a studio, a cockpit—whatever place you have always imagined—but the walls are made of clouds and the desk is a shoreline. A figure steps forward to hand you a nameplate, but it's your younger self, grinning with missing teeth.

"Welcome," they say, "we've been waiting."

Just as you reach out to take the nameplate, your alarm clock starts buzzing, its sound echoing like applause. You wake up, heart pounding, the feeling of that warm light still in your ribs, the certainty that the contest isn't out there but in every choice you make when you're awake.
