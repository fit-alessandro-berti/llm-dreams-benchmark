...written in a language you’ve never seen before, a strange mix of symbols and shapes that seem to shimmer and shift as you try to focus on them. You blink, hoping it’s just a trick of your tired eyes, but the text remains incomprehensible. Panic begins to set in—your entire future hinges on this exam, and you can’t even read the first question.

You glance around the room, hoping to see if others are struggling too, but everyone else is scribbling away furiously, their faces intense with concentration. The proctor, a tall figure cloaked in shadow, stands at the front of the room, watching you with piercing, unblinking eyes. You feel a chill run down your spine as their gaze seems to bore into you, as if they know something you don’t.

Desperate, you look back at the exam paper, and suddenly, one of the symbols begins to glow faintly, pulsing like a heartbeat. You lean closer, and as you do, the symbol seems to whisper to you—a soft, melodic voice that you can’t quite make out. You strain to listen, and slowly, the whispers form into words: “You already know the answers.”

Confused, you sit back, and the glowing symbol fades. But the words linger in your mind. You pick up your pen, hesitating, and then start to write—not answers to the questions, but something else entirely. Your hand moves on its own, sketching strange patterns and shapes that mirror the ones on the paper. As you draw, the room around you begins to dissolve, the desks and students melting away into a swirling mist.

You find yourself standing in a vast, endless field under a sky filled with stars that pulse in rhythm with the symbols you’ve drawn. The shadowy proctor is there, no longer menacing but smiling faintly. “This was never about the exam,” they say, their voice echoing through the field. “This was about remembering who you are.”

Before you can ask what they mean, the ground beneath you trembles, and the stars above begin to fall, each one transforming into a memory—fragments of your life, your dreams, your fears. They swirl around you, and you realize you’re being given a choice: to step forward into the unknown or to stay in the familiar.

What do you choose?
