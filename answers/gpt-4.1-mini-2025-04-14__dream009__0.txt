find shelter and food to survive. The air smells fresh but unfamiliar, and the people around you are dressed in clothes from centuries ago, speaking in an old dialect. You decide to approach a small group nearby, hoping to communicate and learn where you are. One of them notices your confusion and kindly gestures for you to follow. They lead you to a nearby village with wooden houses and cobblestone streets. As you walk, you try to remember any historical knowledge or skills you have that could help you adapt. Once in the village, you are invited to share a meal and rest, giving you time to gather your thoughts and plan your next steps in this strange new world.
