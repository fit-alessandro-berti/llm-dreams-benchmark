**The Dream Continues:**

The stage lights warm your face like a spotlight on a secret, and for a breathless moment, you feel the weight of the crowd—not as a sea of strangers, but as a living, breathing entity, pulsing with anticipation. Your hands are steady (or are they trembling? The dream doesn’t decide), and the first words rise in your throat like bubbles from deep water.

You open your mouth—and nothing comes out.

A silence stretches, thick as syrup. The crowd leans forward, their faces a mosaic of curiosity, concern, even amusement. A child in the front row tilts their head, confused. A man in the back row checks his watch. Your heart hammers against your ribs, but then—

A voice whispers in your ear, not yours, not the crowd’s, but something older, softer. *"Speak from the silence."*

And suddenly, the words aren’t yours to choose. They *are* you, unfolding like a map you’ve always known by heart. Your voice becomes a river, carrying not just sound but *meaning*—each syllable a pebble dropped into the collective mind of the audience. The crowd leans in, and you realize: you’re not giving a speech. You’re *remembering* one.

The words shift. They’re not about politics or success or even inspiration. They’re about the way moonlight pools on a puddle after rain, about the first time you held a bird’s wing and it didn’t fly away, about the quiet terror of waking in a place you don’t recognize and realizing—*this is home*. The audience gasps as tears spill down faces you’ve never seen. A woman in the third row clutches her chest. A man in the front row stands, his hands shaking, and mouths: *"How do you know?"*

You smile. Because you *do* know.

Then—

The stage dissolves beneath you. The crowd becomes a field of tall grass swaying in a wind you can’t feel. You’re standing at the edge of a cliff, looking down at a village of tiny lights. A figure steps beside you—someone you’ve lost, someone you’ve never met, someone who is *you*, but older, wiser, their eyes alight with the same quiet joy you feel now.

*"You did it,"* they say. *"You gave them what they needed."*

And you understand: the speech wasn’t for them. It was for *you*. You’ve been waiting your whole life to say these words, to *be* these words, and now you are.

The dream holds you there, suspended in the afterglow, as the wind carries the last echoes of your voice into the dark. And for the first time, you’re not afraid of waking up.
