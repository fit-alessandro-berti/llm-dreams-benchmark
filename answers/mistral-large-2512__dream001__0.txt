**The Dream Unfolds—**

The city sprawls around you like a living organism—towers of glass and steel pulse with neon veins, their reflections bleeding into the rain-slick streets. The air hums with the murmur of a thousand voices, the clatter of heels on cobblestones, the distant wail of a siren that never quite arrives. You check your pockets: no phone, no wallet, just a single, crumpled business card with a name scrawled in ink that smudges under your thumb—*"Dr. Elias Voss, The Obsidian Spire, 13th Floor."*

The address is missing.

A clock tower looms in the distance, its face cracked, its hands spinning wildly—*57 minutes until the meeting.* You start walking, but the streets twist like a labyrinth. Every turn leads you past the same café, the same woman in a red coat who watches you with hollow eyes, the same newsstand where the headlines read: *"YOU ARE LATE"* in bold, accusatory type.

A child tugs your sleeve. *"You’re going the wrong way,"* they say, voice too old for their face. *"The Spire isn’t on any map."* Before you can ask what they mean, they dissolve into a flock of black birds that scatter into the sky.

Then—**a door.** A plain, unmarked door in the side of a building that wasn’t there a second ago. The knob is warm, almost *breathing.* You turn it.

Inside, the hallway stretches impossibly long, lined with doors that whisper your name. One stands slightly ajar, golden light spilling from the crack. You push it open.

The room is vast, circular, its walls covered in clocks—all stopped at different times. At the center sits a desk, and behind it, a man in a tailored suit with no face, just smooth, featureless skin. *"Ah,"* he says, voice like silk over steel. *"You made it. Though I suppose, in a way, you never left."*

He slides a contract across the desk. The ink is still wet. *"Sign, and the meeting will begin. Refuse, and you’ll wake up—though you’ll always wonder what you missed."*

The clock tower chimes. *One minute left.*

**What do you do?**

(Do you sign? Run? Ask who he *really* is? Or does the dream twist further—maybe the door behind you vanishes, or the clocks all start ticking at once, or the faceless man smiles with a mouth that wasn’t there before?)
