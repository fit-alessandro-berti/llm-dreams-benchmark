... look at the project brief. It's not paper. It's a swirling vortex of numbers and glyphs that pulse with an unsettling energy. The impossible deadline isn't written; it's a *feeling* in the air, heavy and suffocating, like the pressure of deep water.

My boss clears his throat. The sound isn't a normal human sound; it's like dry leaves skittering across pavement. He points at the vortex, and his finger elongates, becoming impossibly thin, stretching towards the shimmering task.

I try to pick it up, but my hand passes right through it. It feels cold, like touching static electricity, and leaves a faint, buzzing echo in my palm. The office lights flicker, casting long, distorted shadows that dance like specters in my peripheral vision.

I look at the clock on the wall, but the hands are spinning backward at a dizzying speed. Or maybe they aren't hands at all, but tiny, frantic spiders crawling over the numbers, which are now melting down the clock face like wax.

My boss makes the dry-leaf sound again, more insistent this time. He points to my computer. I turn, but my monitor is gone. Instead, there's a window opening up in the wall, showing a twilight sky filled with impossible purple and green clouds. And the project... the vortex of numbers and glyphs... is out there, hovering in the sky.

I understand now. The impossible deadline isn't about finishing by a certain time. It's about completing the *sky* before it fades. My desk chair shifts beneath me, growing roots that anchor me to the floor, and my fingers are turning into delicate, translucent wings... I have to fly into the twilight sky and weave the numbers back into the clouds before the dry-leaf sound of my boss becomes the sound of dawn...
