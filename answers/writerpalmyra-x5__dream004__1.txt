...the canvas breathes.

Not metaphorically—its surface rises and falls like a sleeping chest, pale and taut. The air hums with a low tone, the kind you feel in your molars, and the horizon behind you folds into itself, spilling liquid violets and golds across the sky. You reach out, not sure if you want to touch it or run.

But then—a whisper, or maybe a thought that isn’t yours: *“You’ve been here before.”*

Your fingers brush the canvas, and instantly, color floods back into your dream-self—memories that aren’t quite memories flash: a red door that never existed, a child’s laughter in a language without words, a constellation shaped like a name you almost remember.

The canvas begins to paint *you*.

Not just your face—your fears, your favorite scent in the rain, the way you still hum that lullaby from childhood. It draws the crack in your confidence, the quiet hope you carry like a candle in a storm.

A voice, soft and knowing, says, *“Stay. Finish what you started.”*

Do you step into the painting? Or do you turn and walk deeper into the shifting world, leaving the canvas behind?
