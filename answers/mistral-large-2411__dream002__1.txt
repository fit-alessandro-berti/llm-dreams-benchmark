As you continue walking, the once vibrant and lush forest begins to darken. The sun, which was previously casting dappled light through the canopy, is now obscured by thick, roiling clouds. The air becomes heavy with the scent of ozone and the humidity clings to your skin like a damp cloth.

The gentle rustling of leaves turns into a cacophony of whistling winds and creaking branches. The temperature drops sharply, and you can see your breath misting in front of you. The first few raindrops hit your face, cold and sharp, and within moments, the rain intensifies into a torrential downpour.

You seek shelter under a large, ancient tree, its gnarled roots stretching out like welcoming arms. The tree's dense foliage provides some respite from the rain, but the wind continues to howl, shaking the branches above and sending water droplets cascading down.

Suddenly, a bright flash of lightning illuminates the sky, followed by a deafening clap of thunder that reverberates through your chest. The storm seems to be growing stronger with each passing moment, and the forest around you takes on an eerie, otherworldly glow.

As you huddle under the tree, you notice a faint, ethereal glow emanating from the depths of the forest. It seems to beckon you, pulsating with an enigmatic energy that both draws you in and fills you with trepidation. Curiosity piqued, you decide to venture towards the source of the light, leaving the relative safety of the tree behind.

The rain-soaked ground squelches under your feet as you make your way through the storm-tossed forest. The wind whips around you, tossing your hair and clothing in a wild dance. The glow grows brighter and more intense, casting long, dancing shadows on the forest floor.

Finally, you reach the edge of a clearing, and what you see takes your breath away. In the center of the clearing stands a majestic stag, its antlers adorned with glowing, iridescent vines that seem to pulse with an inner light. The stag's eyes meet yours, and in that moment, you feel a connection, a sense of understanding that transcends words.

The storm begins to abate, the rain slowing to a gentle drizzle and the wind dying down to a soft breeze. The stag takes a step forward, and you find yourself doing the same, drawn towards each other by an unspoken bond. As you reach out to touch the stag's velvety nose, the world around you fades away, leaving only the two of you in a moment of pure, serene connection.

And then, as suddenly as it began, the dream shifts, and you find yourself somewhere else entirely, the memory of the storm and the stag lingering like a faint echo in your mind.
