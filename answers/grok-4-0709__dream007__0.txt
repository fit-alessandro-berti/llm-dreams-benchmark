You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to storm out of the room, slamming the door behind you with a thunderous echo that shakes the walls. But as you step into the hallway, the floor beneath your feet turns to quicksand, pulling you down into a swirling vortex of colors—vibrant reds and blues that match the anger and sadness churning in your chest.

You sink deeper, but instead of panic, a strange calm washes over you. Suddenly, you're not falling anymore; you're floating in a vast ocean of memories, where fragments of your friendship bob like buoys on the waves. There's the time you both laughed until dawn on a rooftop, the shared secrets whispered under starry skies, and the petty fights that now seem as insignificant as seashells.

Your friend appears before you, not as they are, but as a giant, luminous fish with scales that shimmer like forgotten apologies. "Why are we fighting?" they bubble out, their voice distorted and echoing through the water. You try to respond, but your words come out as bubbles too, popping into images of the argument's root: a betrayal over a shared dream, perhaps a business venture or a romantic entanglement that tore at the fabric of your bond.

In this underwater realm, you decide to reach out, not with fists or harsh words, but with an open hand. As your fingers touch the fish's fin, the ocean drains away, and you're both back on solid ground—in a meadow now, under a sky painted with auroras. The argument dissolves like mist, replaced by a profound understanding. "It was just a dream," your friend says, but their face morphs into your own reflection, and you realize the friend was you all along, arguing with the parts of yourself you've been ignoring.

You wake up—or do you?—with a lingering sense of peace, the argument's heat cooled by the dream's bizarre wisdom. But as you sit up in bed, the door to your room creaks open, and there stands your friend, real this time, holding two cups of coffee. "We need to talk," they say, and the dream loops back in, blurring the line between sleep and reality. What do you say next?
