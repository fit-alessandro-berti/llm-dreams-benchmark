You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **forge an unlikely alliance with a pack of glowing-eyed mutant wolves**, their fur shimmering like oil slicks under the perpetual ash-cloud sky. 

The alpha wolf, bigger than a bear with jaws that drip neon-blue venom, tilts its head and speaks in your mind: *Human. You smell of fire and forgotten songs. Join the hunt, or become the hunted.*

Together, you prowl the crumbling ruins of what was once Las Vegas, scavenging fusion cells from slot machines fused to skeletons. Raiders ambush from the shadows—tattooed cannibals on rusty motorcycles—but your wolf pack tears through them like paper, leaving trails of glittering blood that hardens into crystal spikes.

Deeper in the neon wasteland, you uncover a hidden vault: shelves of canned laughter, bottled dreams, and a single, humming jukebox that plays hits from a world long dead. You crank it up, and the music summons a storm of fireflies that light your path home.

But as dawn's radioactive glow pierces the horizon, the wolves turn, their eyes reflecting your own face—wild, free, eternal. You wake with fur in your mouth and the echo of howls in your heart. Sweet dreams? Or the start of something real?
