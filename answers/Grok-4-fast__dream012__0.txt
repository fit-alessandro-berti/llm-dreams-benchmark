You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you stand at the helm, salt spray lashing your face like the accusations of ghosts long drowned. The mast creaks like an old man's bones, and the sails billow not with wind but with the frantic wings of forgotten memories—yours, theirs, the sea's own.

"Steady now!" you bellow, your voice a thunderclap that momentarily quiets the gale. But in your heart, you know the truth: this isn't just a storm. It's the unraveling of the world you charted so carefully, the one where compasses pointed true north and horizons promised safe harbor. Your first mate, eyes wide as the abyss, clutches the wheel beside you. "Captain, the stars—they're falling!" he gasps, and sure enough, the sky is a cascade of fireflies turned comets, streaking down to kiss the waves.

You grip the brass speaking tube, its cool metal grounding you, and call to the bosun below: "All hands! Reef the mainsail and batten the hatches. We're not running from this—we're sailing through it!" The crew scrambles like shadows in lantern light, their faces a mosaic of fear and firelight. But as you turn back to the roiling black, something stirs beneath the surface: a leviathan's eye, glowing emerald, winking at you like an old lover's secret.

With a mad grin, you seize the wheel, yanking it hard to starboard. The ship groans, heels perilously, and for a heartbeat, you think you've doomed them all. Then—impossibly—the bow lifts, surfing a wave taller than cathedrals. The leviathan breaches beside you, its scales a tapestry of sunken treasures, and in its mouth, not jaws of death, but a glowing lighthouse, uprooted from some distant shore, beaming a path through the chaos.

You laugh then, wild and free, as the crew cheers, the storm parting like curtains at dawn. The sea calms to a whisper, the stars reform into constellations you've never mapped—ones that spell your name in fiery script. And as the ship glides into uncharted calm, you realize: you weren't captaining the vessel at all. You were the storm itself, dreaming of being saved.

But dreams, like tides, turn. The deck fades to silk sheets, the salt to sweat on your brow, and you wake with the echo of waves in your ears, wondering if the sea still calls you back.
