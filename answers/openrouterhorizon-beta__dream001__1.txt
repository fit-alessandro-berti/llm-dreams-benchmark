…walk, letting your feet choose for you. The streets are wide and glimmering, paved with a material that looks like poured moonlight. Buildings rise like folded paper, their edges sharp, their faces shifting between glass and hillside and old book covers. People pass you with luminous umbrellas though there is no rain, speaking into seashells held to their ears. You try to stop someone to ask for directions, but every face you turn to has the calm, bright expression of a lighthouse, and their eyes sweep over you as if searching a horizon you can’t see.

You check your pockets. In one you find a key shaped like a question mark; in another, a scrap of ticket stub with your own name printed upside down. Your phone is there, but when you unlock it the map is just a white field with a single blue dot that pulses like a heartbeat. The dot whispers left, left, left until you turn in a circle.

You start to jog. The air has a citrus tang and the sky is the color of denim soaking in a basin. You pass a cafe where the clock on the wall shows every hour at once, each number wreathed in steam. The barista pours coffee from a kettle that never empties. You ask her where your meeting is, and she nods gravely, pointing to the ceiling where a small red door is set like a hatch in a ship. “Up,” she says, though there is no ladder.

You step onto a chair, then onto the counter, and when you reach for the door your hand is suddenly holding a bouquet of keys, each one ringing softly like teaspoons. The right key is warm. The hatch swings open and a stairway unspools downward, which you climb by going up. Your footsteps sound like someone else’s.

At the top (which is somehow the bottom), you emerge into a street you recognize but have never seen: the smell of the library you loved as a child, the tilt of the shadows from the late afternoon outside your first apartment. The signs over the shops are written in a language you can read only if you don’t look directly at it. As you glance sideways, letters braid into meaning: “Everything You Forgot To Ask,” “The Tailor of Coincidences,” “Borrowed Time, Restored.”

You check the hour. Your watch face is a pond with a single leaf drifting across; when the leaf reaches the shore, you tell yourself, you will be late. You hurry. Your shoes leave faint prints, not of soles but of sentences, and by the time you look back they have already been edited.

A bus glides to a stop beside you, empty except for the driver, who is your third-grade teacher wearing a conductor’s cap. The sign above the windshield reads: “Express to The Place You Meant.” You climb aboard. The seats are upholstered in postcards; they hum with distant places, salt on your tongue, cinders in your hair. “Do you have a ticket?” the driver asks, and you hand over the upside-down stub. She flips it and it becomes a pressed flower. “Close enough,” she says, and the bus sighs into motion.

Outside, the city rearranges itself. Streets tilt like shelves being dusted. Bridges stitch and un-stitch. A flock of paper birds lifts from a park and reorders into an address which you try to memorize, but every number is a season. “Almost there,” the driver assures you, and you realize she’s humming the tune you whistle when you’re nervous. You didn’t know anyone else knew it.

The bus stops in front of a building that looks like your handwriting made three stories tall. The facade has your favorite window shape—the long kind that catches late light—and a balcony where a coat you lost years ago hangs neatly over the railing. A doorman with the posture of a comma bows. “You’re expected,” he says, and opens the door to a lobby that smells like pencil shavings and rain.

Inside, the elevator has no buttons, only a mirrored panel that reflects you at different ages as the doors close. For a moment you see yourself as a child with a missing tooth, then as you are now, then as someone you haven’t been yet, laughing at a joke you haven’t heard. The elevator hums. You think of all the times you’ve been early and all the times you’ve been late and how each became a story anyway.

The doors open. A corridor stretches out, lined with doors that all bear your initials in varying fonts. You choose the one that makes your name look like a river. It opens into a room that is equal parts conference hall, kitchen, and attic. People are gathered around a long table: a woman who wears your grandmother’s brooch and smells like peppermint, a man whose face you know from a painting in a museum, a child building a city of dominoes that rise and fall in waves. At the head of the table is a chair occupied by no one, as if reserved for your ghost.

“Finally,” says the room. The word comes not from any mouth, but from the light itself. The walls flicker with scenes from your life and scenes you haven’t lived: a train platform in winter, a field of tall grass that breathes, a page turning and turning all by itself. The important meeting, you realize, is with the person you have been writing in the margins—your quiet decisions, your forgotten promises, the one who keeps the ledger of your almosts.

You sit. The chair knows your spine. In front of you is a stack of papers bound by a red thread. The title at the top reads, “Directions, If You Want Them.” The first page says: Start anywhere. You almost laugh from relief. The others at the table nod as if you have passed a test, as if simply arriving is enough, and that the place you were looking for is always where you are when you notice you are there.

Someone pours tea. The steam forms a map that looks like the city outside, only this time there is no blue dot, only a small, steady arrow labeled You. The leaf in your watch touches shore, but instead of being late, you feel right on time. Outside, somewhere, the bus pulls away to make room for your leaving. Inside, the domino city topples and stands again, and you begin—without knowing it—to give yourself directions aloud, and everyone listens as if your voice is a landmark.
