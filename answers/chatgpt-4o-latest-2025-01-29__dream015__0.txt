press forward, determined to survive. The air is thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth, and the distant howls of unknown creatures echo through the abandoned cityscape. 

You scavenge through the ruins of an old grocery store, cautiously stepping over shattered glass and rusted cans. A flicker of movement catches your eye—something or someone is watching you. Heart pounding, you grip the makeshift weapon you fashioned from a piece of rebar and call out, “Who’s there?”

A shadow steps forward from behind a toppled shelf. It’s a young girl, no older than ten, her clothes tattered but her eyes sharp with determination. “I’ve been following you,” she says. “You know how to survive.”

She holds out a small tin of food, her fingers trembling. “Take me with you,” she pleads. 

You hesitate, knowing that taking her in means extra responsibility—but also an ally in this desolate world. 

Just as you’re about to answer, a guttural growl rises from outside. Something is coming. Something big. 

Your choice is clear: **fight, flee, or hide—what do you do?**
