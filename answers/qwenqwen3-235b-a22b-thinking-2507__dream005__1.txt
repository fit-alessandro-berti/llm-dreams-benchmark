The sentence hangs in the air like a half-remembered lyric. *You encounter various groups of people and...*  

**...their conversations shift like smoke the moment you near.**  

You weave through the throng—laughing clusters in jewel-toned dresses, men in sharp suits debating over clinking glasses, teenagers huddled around a phone screen glowing with impossible colors. But as you step close, voices dissolve into static. Words rearrange themselves:  
- The woman in crimson silk turns to you, eyes wide. *“The sparrow wears three keys—”* but her mouth becomes a pocket watch, ticking loudly.  
- A circle of elders passes a teacup that overflows with starlight. *“—but the door is made of shadow,”* they chant, yet their lips move to the rhythm of a song only they hear.  
- A child offers you a paper boat floating in a puddle on the floor. *“Row to Tuesday!”* they insist, but the puddle deepens into an ocean as you blink.  

**You panic.** Your known person—*Maya*, she has a scar like a shy comma above her eyebrow, always twists her hair when nervous—is a lifeline in this sea of strangers. You scan faces:  
- That woman’s laughter echoes Maya’s, but her neck elongates like taffy as she turns away.  
- A man gestures with Maya’s hands, yet his smile is too wide, showing too many teeth.  
- Finally, you spot her *actual* coat—a faded denim jacket dotted with embroidered crows—near a marble staircase. Relief floods you. You rush forward, hand outstretched…  

**...and the jacket turns.**  
It’s not Maya.  

The stranger wearing it has no face—just a smooth, blank expanse where features should be. They hold up a single playing card: the **Five of Pentacles**, showing two figures shivering outside a stained-glass window. The card’s edge rests against your palm, cold as a river stone. *“She left before you arrived,”* the faceless person whispers, though their mouth never moves. *“Look up.”*  

You do.  

The chandelier above isn’t crystal—it’s made of suspended keys, each turning slowly. And there, balanced precariously on the highest key, **Maya sits cross-legged**, waving. Her smile is real, but her hair is dripping wet, and she’s holding a seashell to her ear. The music swells—*is it violins or whale song?*—and suddenly, the floor tilts. Glasses slide off tables, laughter pitches upward into birdsong, and the walls breathe like living things.  

You try to climb toward Maya, but the stairs melt into sand. She cups her hands and shouts something lost in the wind: *“Don’t forget the—”*  

**...and the dream fractures.**  

You’re not falling. You’re floating *backward* through the crowd, past the static conversations, past the ocean-puddle child, till you’re standing exactly where you began—by a grand piano playing itself. The room is silent now. Empty.  

On the piano lid sits a single, wet **feather** and a folded note in Maya’s handwriting:  
> *“You were late. But I left the door open.”*  

Outside the window, dawn bleeds gold across a city that wasn’t there before. The dream isn’t over. It’s waiting.  

*(You wake with sand in your socks and the taste of salt on your tongue.)*  

---

### Why this feels like a *real* dream:
- **Shifting logic**: Conversations morph, physics bends (puddle → ocean, stairs → sand), and time loops ("She left before you arrived" vs. "You were late").  
- **Emotional truth**: The relief of spotting the *wrong* person in Maya’s coat is a classic dream-trap—hope twisting into dread.  
- **Sensory fragments**: Sand in socks, salt taste, dripping hair—dreams anchor absurdity in physical sensations.  
- **Unresolved longing**: The note *implies* a deeper story (What door? Why were you late?), leaving the dream echoing after waking.  

Dreams thrive on the *gap* between what’s seen and what’s understood. Here, the "known person" becomes a compass pointing toward mystery—not safety. After all, in dreams, the person you seek is often *you* in disguise.
