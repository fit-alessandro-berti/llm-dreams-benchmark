As I stumble through the unfamiliar surroundings, my eyes struggle to adjust to the lack of technology I once knew so well. Dust motes dance in the rays of sunlight piercing through the thatched roof of what looks like a modest cottage. The air is thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, a far cry from the sanitized indoors I was accustomed to.

My hands instinctively reach for my phone, my wallet, only to find empty pockets in the strange, rough-spun trousers and tunic I now wear. Panic flutters in my chest, cold and sudden. Where am I? How did I get here?

I push the heavy-looking door open, stepping outside. The world outside is even more alien. Instead of familiar suburban streets or bustling cities, I find myself nestled in a small, tightly packed village of similar cottages, winding cobblestone paths, and a simple-looking marketplace bustling with people in period-dress. A truly medieval village. The buildings look crafted from timber and wattle, roofs covered in thick straw.

My reality shatters into a thousand pieces. This isn't a dream... or is it? If it is, it's a terrifyingly immersive one. I see people carrying simple baskets, animals wandering freely, and a general lack of anything beyond basic wooden tools and rudimentary carts.

As I stand there, stunned, the harsh reality sets in. I am completely lost, utterly without resources or knowledge of this time. The realization hits me with the force of a physical blow: I need to... **figure out exactly what era I'm in.** The fashions, the buildings, the lack of noise – they all point strongly to the medieval period, perhaps even the Middle Ages. But knowing the specifics – whether it's the 14th century, the Black Death era, or some earlier or later point – is crucial. How does society function here? What are the rules? More importantly, what powers or authorities exist? I need to gather information, discreetly, before I make any other decision or move. My survival might depend on understanding this profoundly different world before I even think about trying to navigate it or find a way back, wherever 'back' might be.
