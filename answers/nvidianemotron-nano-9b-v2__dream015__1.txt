You decide to venture into the ruins of a once-thriving city, hoping to find a hidden cache of supplies or a safe haven. The air is thick with dust and the scent of decay, but you press on, your makeshift backpack clanking with whatever scraps you’ve managed to scavenge. As you navigate through crumbling buildings, you hear a faint whimper—a child, perhaps, trapped in the rubble. Your heart races; you could use the resources, but saving a life might be worth the risk.  

You dig through the debris, your hands trembling as you uncover a small, flickering light source. It’s a battery-powered lantern, its glow revealing a hidden room filled with canned food, medical supplies, and a map. But as you reach for the lantern, a sudden crash echoes behind you. A group of masked figures emerges, their eyes glowing with some unnatural light. They’re not human—mutants, or something worse.  

You realize the map in your hand is a trap. The "safe zone" it points to is a myth, a lure set by the very creatures now hunting you. Panic sets in, but you remember the lessons of survival: adapt, think, *fight*. You toss the lantern into the air, its light blinding the mutants for a moment. With a makeshift weapon—a broken pipe and a rock—you fend them off, barely escaping with your life.  

The resources are gone, but the map’s final entry leads you to a cave system rumored to hold a functioning water purifier. You’re not sure if it’s real, but the thought of clean water keeps you moving. As you descend into the earth, the dream shifts. The walls of the cave are lined with bioluminescent fungi, and the air hums with a strange energy. You find the purifier, but it’s guarded by a sentient AI, its voice echoing with a mix of desperation and wisdom.  

It offers you a choice: take the purifier and risk awakening a dormant threat, or leave it and face the unknown. The dream lingers, unresolved, as you stand at the edge of a decision that could change everything.  

What do you do?
