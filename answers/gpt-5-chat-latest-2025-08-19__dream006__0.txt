…speak, but instead of words, glowing threads of light pour from your mouth, weaving patterns in the air. The audience doesn’t seem surprised—in fact, their faces tilt upward in awe, as if this is exactly what they had been waiting for.  

The threads swirl and twist into shifting images: doors opening, rivers flowing, stars blooming and fading like petals. You realize you aren’t delivering a speech at all—you are showing them something beyond language, and in turn, they are feeding you their own quiet energy. Their eyes shimmer as though you’re reflecting back a dream they already knew.  

A hush falls over the hall. You take a step forward, and the stage beneath you softens—not wood, but mist, lifting you upward as though the building itself is dissolving around you. The audience rises into the air with you, each person weightless, carried on the same luminous threads you’ve drawn from yourself.  

Somewhere deep within you, a small voice says: *Now show them the ending only you can create.*  

Would you like me to carry the dream toward something uplifting and empowering, or mysterious and otherworldly?
