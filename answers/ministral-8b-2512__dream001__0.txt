In your dream, the city stretches endlessly before you—towering spires of glass and steel pierce the sky like the ribs of some great, slumbering beast, while neon signs flicker in languages you don’t recognize. The air hums with the distant murmur of a thousand voices, the scent of rain-soaked pavement and something faintly metallic, like old coins or the breath of a machine. You glance down at your hands: they’re warm, but your fingers are slightly translucent, as if you’re made of something between flesh and smoke.

You pull out your phone—only to find it’s cracked, the screen dead. No messages, no calendar, no map. Just a single, glowing app icon: **"The Guide."** It pulses weakly, like a dying firefly. You tap it.

The screen flickers to life, but instead of a map, it shows a **doorway**—not in your phone, but *in the air* before you. It’s framed in swirling silver light, slightly ajar, revealing a hallway lined with doors, each one labeled with a different time: *"10:30 AM," "3:17 PM," "Midnight,"* and one, slightly ajar, reads **"Now."**

A voice—neither male nor female, but layered like a choir of whispers—speaks from the doorway:

*"You are late. But time here is not linear. Choose."*

You step forward, and the moment you do, the city **shifts**. The streets rearrange themselves like a living thing, buildings dissolving into others, the sky splitting open to reveal a vast, starry void where the sun should be. The air grows colder. You realize: this is not a city. It’s a **meeting place**—a threshold between worlds, where the rules of time and space bend.

The door labeled **"Now"** creaks wider. Inside, you see a figure waiting: a person you recognize, but their face is half-obscured by shadow, their posture rigid with expectation. They hold out a **key**—not of metal, but of **starlight**, humming faintly. As you reach for it, the voice returns:

*"The lock is not where you think. The key is the question you forgot to ask."*

Your dream-self hesitates. You remember something—something important—but it’s just out of reach, like a name on the tip of your tongue. The figure tilts their head, and for a second, their face clears: it’s *you*, but older, standing in a room you’ve never seen before. They mouth a single word:

**"Why?"**

The city groans around you. The doors of time are closing. You have to choose: ask the question, and risk unraveling the dream (and maybe your waking life), or step through the door blindly, trusting that the answer will reveal itself later.

What do you do?

*(Or—if you’d like to take a different path, I can weave in another twist!)*
