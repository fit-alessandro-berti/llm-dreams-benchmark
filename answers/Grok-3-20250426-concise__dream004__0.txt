a brush that paints emotions. You touch it, and the canvas bursts with vibrant hues reflecting your joy, fear, and curiosity. Each stroke shifts the world around you, reshaping trees into swirling spirals and rivers into glowing waves. A figure appears, made of light, whispering, "Paint your truth." You hesitate, then paint a single, bold lineâ€”suddenly, the world stills, and you wake up.
