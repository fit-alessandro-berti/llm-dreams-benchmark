You wake up, and the first thing that hits you isn't disorientation, but *smell*. Woodsmoke, damp earth, something floral and sweet, and…animal. A lot of animal. You sit up, blinking against the filtered sunlight dappling through a canopy of leaves. Gone is your bedroom, replaced by a rough-hewn wooden floor and walls of wattle and daub. A thick, woven rug lies beside a low, wide hearth, cold now. 

Panic claws at your throat. One moment you were drifting off to sleep listening to a podcast, the next…this. You’re wearing clothes that feel strangely familiar, yet utterly wrong – a long, linen shift dress, cinched at the waist with a leather cord. 

You stumble to your feet, legs shaky. Peeking through a small, unglazed window, you see a village. Not a quaint, tourist-trap village, but a *real* one. Thatched roofs, chickens scratching in the dirt, people in similar, simple clothing going about their day. No cars, no electricity, no…anything modern. It’s like stepping into a history book. A very *real* history book.

As you explore the small, one-room dwelling, you realize it’s sparsely furnished. A wooden table, a couple of stools, a chest. Inside the chest, you find a few woven baskets, some dried herbs, and a small, worn leather-bound book. It’s written in a script you vaguely recognize as…Old English?

You venture outside, cautiously. The villagers eye you with curiosity, but not hostility. A woman carrying a basket of apples offers you a shy smile. A man sharpening a scythe nods in your direction. They speak, but their accent is so thick, so archaic, you can barely understand a word. 

Then it hits you. Not just the strangeness of the era, but a gnawing, insistent feeling in your stomach. You haven’t eaten. And looking around, you realize you need to… **learn to provide for yourself. Immediately.**

This isn't a vacation. This isn't a historical reenactment. This is survival. You have no money, no skills relevant to this time, and no idea how you got here. You watch the villagers tending their gardens, milking cows, weaving cloth. You realize you need to learn *everything*. 

You approach the woman with the apples, pointing to the fruit and then to your stomach, making a pleading gesture. She understands, offering you one with a kind smile. As you bite into the crisp, tart apple, a new, terrifying thought solidifies: you need to find someone willing to teach you. Someone who won't think you're mad, or a witch, or a spy. 

You need to learn to farm, to cook, to weave, to *live* in this world. And you need to do it fast, before winter comes. The dream shifts, focusing on the determined set of your jaw. You're scared, utterly lost, but a flicker of something else ignites within you – a primal instinct to survive. You take a deep breath, and begin to ask, in halting, broken phrases, "Teach… me?"
