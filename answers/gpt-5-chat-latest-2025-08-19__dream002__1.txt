…the once gentle canopy above begins to shiver with wind. The light dims as clouds gather faster than seems natural, their edges glowing faintly as though lit from within. The trees, tall and ancient, sway but do not break—almost as if they are bending in unison, acknowledging what’s coming.  

Your heart quickens. The air thickens with the metallic scent of rain, and the hush that falls between each gust makes the forest feel like it’s holding its breath. Then, in the distance, a low rumble rolls through the ground, not quite thunder but something deeper, something alive.  

You notice a narrow path ahead, one you hadn’t seen before. It glows softly, as though the earth has been marked by moonlight despite the storm-dark sky. If you follow it, perhaps it will guide you to shelter—or perhaps to the source of this strange energy that stirs both fear and wonder in you.  

The first raindrops begin to fall, cool against your skin, and you realize you stand at a crossroads of choice: seek safety beneath the shelter of the trees… or step onto the glowing path that seems to lead directly into the heart of the storm.  

Would you like me to continue the dream along **the glowing path**, or see what happens if you remain beneath the trees?
