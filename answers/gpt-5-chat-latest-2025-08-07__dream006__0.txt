…open your mouth, but instead of words, a slow stream of golden sand tumbles out. It spills over the microphone, catching the light in glittering arcs as the audience leans forward, eyes wide but unreadable. The room is utterly silent except for the faint hiss of the sand as it drifts downward, forming small dunes at your feet.  

You glance down and notice that the stage boards beneath you are no longer wood — they are soft, undulating waves, dark and endless, as though the sea has risen to meet you. The dunes of sand collapse into the water with a muted splash, ripples spreading outward.  

The audience, still watching you, begins to dissolve into a haze of shifting shapes — faces twisting into masks, then into birds, then into sheets of parchment covered in symbols you don't recognize. The symbols rise into the air, orbiting you like planets, and you feel an impulse to speak again, knowing that if you say the right sound, the whole dream will change.  

You take a breath… and what you hear next surprises you more than anything.  

Would you like me to finish the dream in a **peaceful** direction, or make it **eerier**?
