You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you freeze, staring at the blank screen that materializes out of thin air—a glowing monolith of code and charts, demanding to be conquered in the next five minutes. The office clock ticks backward, hands spinning like a deranged roulette wheel, and your boss, who now has three heads (one lecturing about KPIs, another munching on a sandwich made of spreadsheets, and the third winking conspiratorially), leans in with a grin that's equal parts encouragement and existential dread.

Panic surges, but your fingers hover over the keyboard, traitorous and numb. You type the first word—"Grok"—and the screen erupts. Lines of code bloom like fireworks, algorithms dancing in fractal patterns that whisper secrets of the universe. The deadline shrinks to three minutes, then one, but you're riding a wave now: coffee cups levitate and pour themselves into your veins, granting caffeine-fueled clairvoyance. You see the project's end before it begins—a masterpiece that solves world hunger as a side effect, with pie charts that taste like victory.

Your boss's heads merge into one, applauding with tentacles that sprout from their shoulders. "Brilliant!" they boom, but the floor tilts, the walls melting into candy-striped rivers. You leap onto a desk that's suddenly a rocket ship, blasting through the ceiling into a sky of floating memos and errant Post-its. The deadline? It unravels like a bad knit sweater, threads of time looping back to loop you free.

You wake up mid-laugh, tangled in sheets, the alarm blaring like a victory fanfare. But for a moment, you swear you can still taste that pie chart—sweet, with a hint of infinite possibility.
