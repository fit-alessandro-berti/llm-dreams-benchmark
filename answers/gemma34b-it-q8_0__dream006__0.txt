…to speak, not to a room buzzing with people, but a vast, iridescent lavender field stretching toward an impossistant horizon. The scent of violet pollen thick and strangely comforting filled the air.  A low hum of chording began, resonatable not audibly, but felt directly within my rib cage and throat – a song the field was composing. 

My notes fluttered uselessly in my hand, brittle beneath my fingers. There were none to translate, no words for this place. So I stopped. Just stopped trying to shape phrases. Letting the silence of the field bloom with me.

Instead of a speech, I began to draw with beams of pure moonlight that seemed born of my own being, looping spirals and intricate glyphs in the air before me. They weren't words, not anymore. With each stroke, a tiny, shimmering hummingbird burst forth, drawn to the patterns, feeding on light and colour and…sadness, I instinctively realised. 

I felt intensely connected to each little bloom of turquoise and ruby, experiencing a sliver of their tiny, joyous lives. They weren’t *for* anyone. It just *happened*. The humming intensified, layering with subtle shifts in the lavender color - a wash of apricot where a sadness lingered, a vibrant pulse of cerulean where a new joy flared. 



As the field reached a particular complexity, a figure detached from the depths of the flowers, slow and solemn, appearing as solid as moonlight and equally unreal.  It wasn't human, nor animal. Just…presence. They tilted their face, which resembled a blooming lilypad, and looked at me expectantly. 

And I suddenly understood - my speech wasn’t *for* the audience.  It was *to* them - a conversation, an act of pure, silent, creating, of letting the lavender answer back. 




…and then, the humming coalesced into a single, vast thought – “Show them… *how* to feel” and everything dissolved around me into a cascade of violet light.
