…check your phone, but the screen has turned to liquid mercury that slips through your fingers and pools in your palm, showing your own face looking back with a worried expression that isn't quite yours. You try to ask a passerby for directions, but their mouth opens and releases a flock of moths that scatter into the neon streetlights, and when you blink, they've become a mailbox with your name written on it in a language you haven't learned yet but somehow understand.

You start to run.

The pavement beneath your feet softens into carpet, then sand, then the tiled floor of a hotel lobby that smells like your grandmother's attic. The buildings lean in to whisper to each other, their windows blinking like eyelids. You check your watch—thirty minutes left—but the hands are moving backward, or perhaps they're roots growing into your wrist, and you realize with dream-certainty that the meeting isn't in a building at all, but *inside* the concept of Tuesday.

An elevator opens in the side of a cloud. You step inside and press the button for the 47th floor, but the elevator slides sideways through the architecture, passing through walls that feel like curtains of warm rain, through offices where people with heads like antique clocks are having meetings about the weather inside your chest. You see your briefcase—when did you get a briefcase?—sitting on a desk three dimensions away from you, and you reach through the space between heartbeats to grab it.

Fifteen minutes, or maybe fifteen years.

The city begins to fold. Streets crease like origami, bringing the distant spire close enough to touch, but when you reach out, it dissolves into butterflies that spell out an address: **The Place Where You Left Your Keys in 2003.** You follow them, running up staircases that spiral through the sky like DNA, each step a different color of your childhood.

You arrive. The door is made of the sound of rain on a windshield. You push it open.

The room is circular, infinite, and empty except for a chair facing a mirror. You sit. In the reflection, the city stretches out behind you—not vast and unfamiliar anymore, but mapped across the lines of your own outstretched hands like a destiny you've been carrying all along. Your watch chimes. It is time.

You open your mouth to speak, and the meeting begins.
