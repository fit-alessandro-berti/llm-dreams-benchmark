You hear the distant rumble of thunder, like something ancient and powerful moving through the trees. The air grows colder, and you notice the sunlight fading, replaced by a soft, grey mist that clings to your skin. You pause, your footsteps slowing as the forest whispers secrets around you. 

Then, from the shadows of a towering oak, a figure appears — not human, but something like a creature of forest magic. It speaks in a voice like rustling leaves, sharing the tale of a forgotten promise and an old oath. You realize that this storm is not just a weather shift, but a reminder of a story waiting to be told — one that only the forest remembers.

You follow the figure deeper into the woods, where the trees grow taller and the path winds like a river. The sky clears for a moment, revealing the first stars of the night, guiding you toward a place where the lesson of the forest awaits. 

Would you like me to continue expanding the dream in this direction?
