The air hangs heavy with dust and the acrid scent of scorched earth. Rusted remnants of skyscrapers claw at an ash-gray sky, skeletal fingers against the gloom. You pull your tattered cloak tighter, the rough fabric scraping against chapped lips. Your stomach clenches with a familiar, gnawing emptiness. When was the last time you'd eaten a full meal? You couldn't remember.

Dangers are everywhere. Not just the roving gangs who'd kill for a can of stale beans or a functioning battery, but the silent threats too: toxic puddles that bubble malignantly, unstable structures ready to collapse, and the strange, twisted creatures that scuttle in the shadows of the ruins – things that were once human, perhaps, or something else entirely, driven mad by the fallout.

You push yourself up from the crumbling concrete step you'd been resting on, joints protesting. Your water skin is nearly empty, your ration bars gone yesterday. You need shelter before nightfall – the dark brings terrors worse than the mutants. As you navigate a treacherous alley choked with debris, a small shape darts across your path, collapsing behind a mound of rubble.

Instinctively, you freeze, hand reaching for the makeshift knife at your belt. A heartbeat passes. Two. Then a low, desperate whimper reaches you – thin, childish, laced with terror. Peering around the edge of the rubble, you see them: a young child, no more than six or seven, clad in filthy rags far too thin for the chill. They're trembling violently, eyes wide with primal fear, clutching a dented, empty tin can like a talisman. A scavenger, like you. But alone. And terrified.

A guttural growl echoes from the alley's mouth. Not human. Something large, something *wrong*. The child's whimper turns into a choked sob. They're trapped.

In that moment, looking into those terrified eyes, the gnawing hunger, the bone-deep exhaustion, and the sheer, overwhelming danger of this world crystallize. But so does something else – a stubborn, irrational ember buried deep within you. A flicker of something that refuses to be snuffed out by the ashes.

**Despite the hardships, you decide to help them.**

The growl intensifies, closer now. The child shrinks back, tears cutting tracks through the grime on their cheeks. Without a second thought, you lunge forward, not towards the threat, but towards the child. You scoop them up with surprising strength, ignoring their startled cry, and shove them behind you just as a massive, misshapen shadow fills the alley entrance. It's a hunched, furry abomination, its eyes glowing faintly red, drool slavering from a muzzle lined with too many teeth. Instinct takes over. You draw your knife, not to fight, but to create a distraction. You hurl a chunk of debris at the creature.

It snarls, a sound like grinding metal, and lunges towards the noise, momentarily forgetting the child. You don't wait. You grab the child's hand, their fingers surprisingly cold and small in your grip.

"Run!" you yell, your voice raw. "Run now! Don't stop!"

You pull them after you, weaving through the labyrinth of ruins. The creature's heavy footfalls and enraged bellows echo behind you, getting closer. The child stumbles, gasping for breath, but you haul them up, dragging them onward. Your lungs burn, your heart pounds against your ribs. Escape seems impossible. Yet, as you race through the crumbling cityscape, the ash swirling around you, the child's terrified grip tightens in yours. It's a fragile connection, a tiny spark of shared humanity in a world determined to extinguish it.

You don't know where you're going. You don't know if you'll outrun the beast. You don't know if there's any safety left to find. But clutching that small, trembling hand, feeling the desperate trust radiating from the child, you know one thing with a fierce, burning certainty:

**You decide to keep going.** Not just for survival, but for *theirs*. For this fragile spark. For the stubborn belief that even in this blasted hellscape, kindness isn't dead. And as the creature's roar shakes the very air behind you, you run, pulling the child with you, into the unknown, grey expanse of the dream.
