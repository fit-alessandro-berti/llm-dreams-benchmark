**1. A group of friends asks, "who's looking for you?"**

You saunter into a cozy café, where a gaggle of boisterous friends laugh and joke. They look amused when you don’t know the answer. "If you're new around here, we'd love to help you get lost!" They invite you to a table as they introduce themselves—a quirky hairdresser, a sports enthusiast, and a silent but sharp wit. They hide a sly smile. "Don't worry, we're open to all sorts of introductions..." This blinding warmth and camaraderie send a faint signal—they might be in alignment with the person you're searching for.

**2. A family reunion takes over the bar**

DJ music thumps, but the volume of clinking glasses, shared stories, and occasional laughter distracts. Around you, a family—hapless, exuberant, and now quite near-boot-heavy—takes over the bar. A flowsod basset with a miswired vest: "You’re right near them, you departünéta!" They point up, leading you to a group of sophisticated strangers. You notice their laugh, and your heart skips. "That’s exactly what *your* friend sounds like!" You scan the room—your friend floats in a fuzzy swimsuit, looking entirely out of place among these sartorial types. Your heart fades. "That’s not enough..." 

**3. A gentleman’s study with mystery and poker**

You persuade your one friend into agreeing to a quieter room, and again you’re met with a dapper-looking stronghold. The set includes: "the famous Professor Guy" (who eyes you with curiosity, his combes earnest), his skeptical foreman (who unwittingly mirrors interest), and "the Codename Kinjo" who listens awkwardly with sharp ears. You search, deck in hand. The professor nods, then points to a tattered photo: *"Exactly your type!..."* After a hasty, out-of-character grin, Professor smirks: "Still looking for the ‘global humanitarian’?" You turn up the relief, knowing the answer, but to whom? 

**4. The last hope: a hidden studying area**

You finally inch close, catching a glimpse of the nostalgia of soft, incandescent lights. You approach, and a past acquaintance emerges: "Hey, enough! You can't be everywhere, only *around here!*" They let you in and back-of-stage: towering bookshelves, and a slice of wordplay. You take a deep breath and let them tell the answer. "Up here... in one of these rooms." Dusty bookmarks surprise you. *"Maverick dreams. Pirate metallurgy. Indian Ocean..."* You smile, and hope you'll have enough to remember you Caroline in a party room. Even while still searching, you feel closer to your target.

**The dream ends with:**

*You take one final look at the fading stars or photos, horse and manage to recall the last piece of the puzzle, the crucial witness who only stares at you with kindness.*
"The friends of friends in the café! *That's it!* I think they're called..." You don't need to finish. A smile faint creeps into the shadows of your heart. "That's probably true, by glory."*
