You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to wander through streets that seem to rearrange themselves with every step, the cobblestones humming faintly under your feet like a restless heart.

The sky above is a kaleidoscope of pastel clouds that drift in slow, deliberate circles, casting shadows that move in reverse. Neon signs flicker in languages you’ve never learned, yet the symbols pulse in time with your own breathing. A gentle breeze carries the scent of fresh rain and toasted almond pastries, making your stomach growl despite the surreal setting.

You glance at your watch—though it’s a brass pocket chronometer with an ornate, spinning compass rose—only to discover that the hands are not pointing to numbers but to constellations. The meeting is at “the intersection of Orion’s Belt and the Tower of Echoes,” the face of the watch whispers with a soft, metallic echo.

Instinctively, you turn a corner and find a massive, glassy tower that hums with a low, melodic resonance. Its surface reflects the city like a gigantic mirror, but the reflections are slightly out of sync, showing fleeting glimpses of other places—a sunlit meadow, a bustling market, a quiet library. A sign on the tower’s entrance reads, “Elevator to the 7th Thought.”

You push open the heavy doors, and a gentle cascade of warm light envelops you. Inside, the lobby is an endless hallway of floating platforms, each one a different shade of blue, moving ever so slightly as if breathing. A concierge, a tall figure draped in flowing silver robes, smiles without eyes and extends a translucent card that glows with your name etched in ink that never seems to dry.

“Your meeting is on the 7th platform,” the figure says, voice like wind through chimes. “Time is a river; it bends, but it never stops flowing.”

You step onto the first platform, and it lifts you gently upward. As you ascend, the city below stretches into a tapestry of light and color, the buildings dissolving into ribbons that twist like aurora borealis. The platforms shift, each one revealing a different scene: a serene garden where moonflowers bloom in daylight, a bustling café where patrons converse in music instead of words, a library where the books rearrange themselves into constellations on the shelves.

When the seventh platform finally comes into view, a quiet courtyard opens before you. At its center stands a round table made of polished ebony wood, surrounded by chairs that look like they’re carved from clouds. Seated at the table is a person you don’t recognize—tall, with skin that shimmers like liquid mercury, eyes reflecting the entirety of the city you just left.

“You made it,” they say, their voice a chorus of distant bells, “the city always tests those who have something to give.”

You sit, feeling a strange calm settle into your bones. The minutes melt away, but you notice a faint ticking—a reminder that even in dreams, deadlines exist. The mercury figure slides a thin, silver envelope across the table. Inside is a single sheet of paper, inked in a hand that seems both yours and not yours at the same time.

The words read: “In every unfamiliar place, the true meeting is with yourself. Remember the path you walked, the sounds you heard, and the lights you followed. When you wake, you will carry this map in your heart.”

As you read, the courtyard begins to dissolve into mist, the tower’s hum fading into a soft lullaby. You feel the pull of waking, the familiar weight of your real pillow beneath your cheek, yet the echo of the city remains—its colors, its music, its promise that wherever you go, you’ll always find your way, even when you have no idea where you’re headed.
