You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and your memory keeps changing what you’re looking for. The room is the size of an airport and the ceiling is low, hung with a hundred different lamps—paper lanterns, brass chandeliers, a single bare bulb that buzzes like a bee. The music is the kind that knows your footsteps, and every time you pause it pauses too, as if pretending it wasn’t following you.

In the first group, everyone wears a name tag, but the tags say not names, only adjectives: Gentle, New, Currently, Unavoidable. Someone turns to you with a marker and asks who you are. You almost say your own name, but it tastes wrong in your mouth, like a note you can’t reach. You say Familiar because it’s the closest, and they give you a tag and nod as if you have answered some larger question. You ask if anyone has seen your person, and they assure you with big certain eyes that they saw them go that way, and they all point in different directions at once, like a bouquet of arms.

In the second group, people are gathered around a punch bowl filled with keys. House keys, car keys, keys that look like sea creatures, keys that fit nothing. “You can take one,” someone says. “It unlocks the conversation you need.” You reach your hand in and your fingers touch something cold with teeth. You pull out a key shaped like your grandmother’s earring, and they all gasp and look delighted. “Oh, that one,” they say, as if it explains you. You turn it in your palm, and when you look up, the group has become a hallway lined with coats. You put the key in your pocket and remember your person once lost their keys for three weeks and then found them in the freezer, wrapped in a bag of peas, and you laugh alone.

You walk. The hall goes on, coats brushing your shoulders with their sleeves like shy animals. They smell like rain, like libraries, like old smoke. In a pocket you find a folded paper and open it. You expect a map, but it’s a photograph of your own hands, taken from above, holding something that has been torn away by the picture’s edge. Written on the back is a time you can’t read because the numbers are light and keep moving when you try to hold them down.

In a curtained corner a group of people sit cross-legged on the floor playing a game where everyone describes the same memory in a different voice. “The beach,” says one, and it becomes your beach (the glare, the hot sand that squeaked like rubber, your father’s hat). “No, the boat,” says another, and it’s now a boat you have never been on, with ropes that smell of salt and a woman who hums as if she’s polishing the sea. You reach out to ask if they’ve seen your person, and they say, kindly: “We all have. You just have to remember them the right way.”

You keep walking, passing a group of people who are laughing so hard their faces are wet and their laughter is the same note over and over, like a metronome. You don’t know the joke, and you pretend you do. Another group has formed around a carpet stain in the shape of a country. They argue about whether it’s an animal instead, and one of them steps back and says, “It’s just a stain,” and everyone else looks at them as if they’ve broken something fragile. You think about your person and wonder if they would point out the animal or the nation, or if they would gently move the glass so it doesn’t spill at all.

You cross into the kitchen where the party’s center of gravity leans, the bright room where the light from the open fridge makes everyone look like a painting lit from within. People here are slicing, stirring, tasting; a man is buttering bread with the back of a silver spoon and not looking at what he’s doing. You open your phone to text your person, but the letters are re-learning themselves and when you press M you get a small bird instead, which flutters off and looks insulted. “They’re upstairs,” someone tells you, and points to a staircase that leads down. You thank them as if it’s helpful and take the stairs that go down to the upstairs.

On the landing is a mirror, but it doesn’t return you; it offers a version of your person. For a moment you think you’ve found them, standing with their back to you, hand on the banister, head turned slightly as if they’ve heard their name. You move closer and the person in the glass turns too, the angle of their face almost yours but not—your person is always almost you in the moments you can’t reach them. You touch the mirror and it is warm. Someone behind you says, “Don’t smudge that, it’s rented,” and you apologize to the mirror and to your reflection and to the stranger who smiles as if forgiveness is their occupation.

Upstairs (downstairs) is a garden, impossibly, with grass that has recently been combed. Strings of lights make a low sky. People are playing a slow game of badminton with a birdie made of words. Every time it is hit it spells a different sentence in the air: I will be right there / Wait up / Almost / Sorry. You watch the syllables wobble, then fall and turn back into feathers. At the far end there is a pool filled with koi that are more intention than fish. They make tiny sounds like knives being drawn. When you lean over the water, each fish has your person’s mouth and says your name in the way you like it, the way that makes you want to sit down and tell the truth. You want to jump in. You want to stay exactly as you are, ankles braced, eyelids full of string lights.

The band begins to play in the next room, only there is no band. A speaker hums and the hum folds itself into a trumpet’s apology and a drum’s persistence. People begin to dance in slow, wide circles like weather systems. You join them because you don’t want to be the kind of person who stands on the edge and nods as if that were dancing, and because you know your person loves this song, which is not a song you can name but the song that plays when you are very tired and very awake at the same time. A woman with a necklace that looks like punctuation takes your hand and says, “They went outside for air,” as if air is the rarest thing, and her hand feels exactly like someone you once trusted too much.

Outside is a balcony with a railing that has learned to sway like hips. The night is full of very polite stars that wait to be introduced. Below, the party continues in other rooms you haven’t visited yet: the room full of hats, the room with the ice sculpture that is sweating, the room where all the people who have left are still here in their coats at the doorway saying goodbye over and over with new stories each time. You lean on the railing and you are briefly happy for no reason and then you realize the reason is: a figure down in the garden, walking slowly with a drink in one hand, touching a string of lights with the other as if it might vibrate. You recognize the tilt of their head, the way they move like they have learned that you reach the thing you want by walking toward something else. Your throat says their name for you. The night holds it and then returns it to you, softened.

You try to go down the stairs to them. The stairs try to go up. You negotiate. You give the stairs back the stories you took from them—the time you fell down, the time you ran two at a time because joy was chasing you, the time you turned around halfway and forgot why you had come. The stairs are satisfied and become a ramp. By the time you reach the garden, the figure is a little farther away, the string of lights a rosary of tiny moons.

You move through another group—this one is telling fortunes with coasters. “You will leave early,” one reads. “You will stay and forget to leave,” says another. “You will look for someone and find yourself instead,” reads yours, but you fold it under your hand because you don’t want to be the kind of person who is very predictable to paper. You step around a table where a man is crying into a napkin and saying, “It’s a good cry,” to nobody in particular. There is a sudden sweetness in the air and you taste powdered sugar and then realize there is a bakery case where the piano should be, and the pianist is inside, playing the keys with their fingernails, smiling as if secrets are delicious.

You are almost close enough to touch their sleeve. You reach and your hand goes through steam. For a frightened second you think you have lost them again, and the party leans away from you, and the music looks down at its shoes. You open your mouth to ask the room to help, to say their name out loud twice, the way you would call a cat, and the lights flicker, and something settles.

“Hey,” says the softest voice, the one that knows your morning face. “Hey, you made it.”

You turn, and there they are, sitting on the low wall as if it were always supposed to be a bench, as if sitting is a dance. Their face changes every time you notice it: friend from last year, cousin from third grade, the cashier who once said the exact right thing, the person you stopped writing to, the neighbor from the first apartment whose shoes were always lined up neatly as if they slept. All of them are the same person, which is a useful dream fact. The relief in your body is like warm laundry. You sit. Your shoulder meets their shoulder the way a lid meets its pot.

“I’ve been looking for you,” you say, which is nothing and everything.

“I know,” they say, and you believe them.

You talk without remembering how conversation works, which is how most conversations work anyway. You say, Did you see the room with the coats. Did you hear the trumpet hum. Did you know the stain is a country. They say yes and no to all of it and laugh when you want them to laugh, and you do not need to tell them your name to be somebody specific. Someone brings you both a slice of cake and disappears before you can thank them, as if gratitude is a cape you can wear without anyone seeing.

A small breeze presses the paper lanterns against their ribs. The lights click in their sockets to make sure they still belong. Your person taps the folded coaster in front of you with one finger and doesn’t ask what it said. You slide it to them and they slide it back and it becomes just a circle of thick paper with an orange ring from someone’s earlier drink, and that’s enough.

From the rooms inside comes the sound of someone singing badly on purpose and then singing well by accident. Your person rests their chin in their hand and looks at you as if you are the topic and the subtopic both. “Do you want to see something?” they say, and you nod, because this is what yes is for.

They lead you to a door you’d passed three times and not part of your brain had agreed it was there. The key in your pocket warms in anticipation, the old earring key shaped like a choice. You fit it into the lock and it turns with the private satisfaction of a coin finding its way home. Inside is not a room but the smell of rain arriving, strong and silver. The two of you stand and smell it as if it were a painting of weather, and for a long time you do nothing else, which is the opposite of looking and the same as finding.

When you turn back, the party has reorganized itself without you and not because of you. Your person is picking confetti from your hair with a carefulness that feels like music. The stairs are no longer negotiating; they simply offer themselves to whatever direction you intend. Someone is singing your name correctly from the kitchen, where the cake is already a story, and someone else is telling a joke you will only understand later, on the walk home.

You will leave early and you will stay and forget to leave. You will look and you will be looked at. You will find them and you will find yourself finding, and then you will wake with the feeling of a key still warm in your hand, and when you open your eyes you will be for a moment at the party and for a moment not, and both will be true in the way that stairs go downstairs to upstairs, and you will say their name twice in an empty room, and it will answer you, like a door.
