You decide to **walk away**.

My chest heaves, the air in the room feeling heavy and thick, like the air before a storm. I turn on my heel and step out into the hallway, the sound of our raised voices fading into a dull hum the moment I cross the threshold. I don't go far—just a few feet away—and I lean back against the wall, sliding down until I'm sitting on the cool floor, closing my eyes as the adrenaline slowly begins to drain out of my limbs.

Slowly, the image of my friend's angry face begins to blur, and the reasons we were arguing start to feel incredibly small. I’m left sitting in the silence, not feeling the heat of the argument anymore, but just a deep, aching sadness that the distance between us feels so much wider than the empty hallway right now.
