You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language you don’t recognize—lines of looping script that shift when you try to focus on them. The classroom is quiet, but you hear your own heartbeat echoing in the walls. You flip to the first page, and suddenly the questions begin to *answer you*—they whisper your childhood fears, your unspoken regrets, the name of someone you haven’t thought about in years. A single word appears in the center of the page: *Choose.*

And then the clock starts ticking backwards.
