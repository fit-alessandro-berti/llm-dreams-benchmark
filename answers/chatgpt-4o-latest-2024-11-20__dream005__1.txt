are surprised by the variety of conversations and atmospheres in each cluster. The first group you approach is discussing something that feels oddly cryptic—snippets about "rewriting maps" and "the sound of color." They all turn to look at you as you approach, but their smiles seem to stretch just a little too wide, as if they know something you don’t. Feeling unsettled, you politely excuse yourself.

As you weave your way through the crowd, the environment shifts subtly. The air grows warmer, and the walls seem to expand and contract slightly, as if the building itself is breathing. You pass another group of people, who are laughing so hard that their faces blur at the edges. When one of them looks up and meets your gaze, their eyes flicker like candle flames, and you feel an inexplicable pull toward them. Before you can confront this curious sensation, a loud sound—like a bell, but more resonant, as if it reverberates in your chest—draws your attention away.

You follow the sound into a quieter corner, where a small group of people is gathered in a circle, whispering in unison. The words are indecipherable, but they seem to form shapes in the air. One of the shapes—a bird made of shimmering silver threads—breaks free and flits toward you. It circles your head before darting off into the crowd.

Determined to find the one person you know, you push forward, but the gathering begins to feel even more surreal. Time seems to shift; minutes stretch endlessly, then suddenly snap forward. At one point, you glance out a window and see not the outdoors but a vast, starry expanse, as though the entire party has been transported to the edge of the universe.

Finally, you spot your friend—or at least you think it's them—standing by a table that seems to transform every time you look at it. One moment it's covered in glasses of champagne, the next it's a glowing pool of water, rippling as if touched by an invisible hand. You call out their name, but their response is drowned out by a sudden wave of music—haunting and beautiful, a melody you feel you’ve heard before, though you can’t quite place it.

Your friend gestures for you to follow them, and you weave through the crowd together. They lead you to a door you hadn’t noticed before, ornate and golden, with a handle that feels warm under your touch. You hesitate, sensing that whatever lies beyond this door will change everything about the dream—and perhaps something about yourself.
