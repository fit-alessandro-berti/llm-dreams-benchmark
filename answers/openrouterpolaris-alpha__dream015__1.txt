…build something instead of just survive.

You start small.

- You gather scavenged sheet metal, cracked solar panels, broken tools, frayed wires.
- You trade a half-melted flashlight casing for a screwdriver, a rumor, and a warning: “Generators go missing in this district. If they don’t take your machine, the dust will.”

Still, you keep going.

You find an old playground half-swallowed by sand and silence. The swings creak when the wind moves through, as if remembering children. You claim it as your ground.

Days pass in a rhythm of risk:
- Morning: you walk the dead streets, pockets full of bolts, eyes on every rooftop.
- Noon: you strip copper from walls, argue with crows, count your breaths walking past a burned-out convoy still smelling faintly of plastic.
- Night: you sit under a mangled slide with a headlamp and work until your fingers ache.

You piece together a crude solar array, aiming it at a sky more ash than blue. You weld a frame. You curse when things don’t fit, when batteries leak, when screws strip bare. You talk to yourself because no one else is there.

No, that’s not true.

One evening a kid appears. Thin. Watchful. Hair cut with a knife, badly.

“They’ll see your light,” the kid says. “If you get it working.”

“They’ll see it,” you agree. “That’s the point.”

The kid frowns, like you’ve said something dangerous. “Nothing good comes to light.”

“Then something good will have to come from it.”

That night, the kid doesn’t leave. Just sits nearby, wrapped in a ragged jacket, pretending not to be cold.

You hand over half your dinner without comment. After a moment, they eat it like they’re suspicious of generosity, but hunger wins. You don’t ask their name; they don’t ask what you’re building.

Soon it stops being just you. People arrive the way stray thoughts arrive in a tired mind.

- An ex-teacher who can’t stand the silence of empty days.
- A mechanic who has forgotten how to believe in anything except torque specs.
- An old woman who knows where water used to be, back before the maps became lies.

They come for scraps, or curiosity, or to see if you’ve lost your mind so completely that it’s contagious.

You put them to work.

You tell the mechanic, “I’m building a beacon.”

He squints at your mismatched parts. “This isn’t a beacon. This is scrap glued to wishful thinking.”

“Scrap glued to wishful thinking is all anything is,” you answer. “Help me make it work.”

He mutters, but his hands move with muscle memory, straightening, tightening, measuring. The ex-teacher sorts the salvage into organized piles and labels them on torn cardboard. The old woman marks on the ground where underground pipes once ran, lines disappearing beneath dust as if the earth itself is shy.

The kid—who still hasn’t told you their name—climbs the old swing set and lashes a mast to the top, fearless in the wind.

At first the work is survival-disguised-as-hope:
- Better wiring means you can charge tools.
- Better tools mean you can reinforce walls.
- Reinforced walls mean you might last another week.

But then survival becomes hope-disguised-as-survival.

The beacon takes shape: a lattice of scavenged metal, a spine of light. Not just illumination, but a signal.

“What are you calling?” the ex-teacher asks.

“Anyone,” you say. “Someone. Each other.”

“There’s no one left.”

You check a connection, feel the hum of potential beneath your fingertips. “Then we’ll be the proof that’s not true.”

Rumors spread the way they do, even at the end of the world. People show up furtively at the edge of the playground to stare at the skeletal tower and your stubborn little camp.

Some stay. Some just watch and leave, as if you’re an omen they don’t want to understand.

One night, the gangs come.

You knew they would. They always gravitate to power: batteries, generators, hope.

Headlights cut through the dust. Boots stamp. Guns glint.

The leader walks ahead, casual, like this is just business. “We’ll be taking your rig,” he says. “You’re welcome for us not killing you.”

You feel the fear like a second heartbeat—but it’s quieter than it used to be. Behind you, the mechanic, the teacher, the old woman, the nameless kid, and a handful of others stand close.

You should negotiate. You don’t. Instead you say, “You can use it with us. Or you can break it and go back to the dark with everyone else.”

He laughs. It’s almost genuine. “You think this does anything?”

You flick a switch.

For a moment, nothing.

Then the panels’ stored charge surges. The tower coughs, sputters, then blooms: fractured LEDs, mirrored shards, polished scraps all catching and throwing light until it pours over the ruins in jagged brilliance. It’s imperfect and uneven and absolutely undeniable.

The gang members flinch, eyes narrowing against brightness they’re not used to.

And then something unexpected happens.

You hear distant shouts.

Not terrified; answering.

Specks of movement on the horizon. Other lights. Small at first. Lanterns raised. A bike with a jury-rigged headlamp. A handheld mirror flickering back.

People had been waiting, watching, wondering if anyone would ever be foolish enough to try to shine.

The leader’s smirk falters as he realizes: this isn’t a secret stash he can swallow. This is a declaration. If he destroys it, he becomes the man who broke the first hope anyone’s seen in years, in front of witnesses who have just remembered they are many and he is few.

His power was based on isolation. Your tower just broadcast the opposite.

He spits in the dirt. “You’ll attract worse than us.”

“Then we’ll see them coming,” you say. “And they’ll see us.”

A long silence. He gestures to his people, a tight, irritated wave. They back off. For now.

When they’re gone, your knees almost give way. You didn’t realize how much you’d been holding your breath.

The kid looks up at the lit tower, eyes wide, finally soft. “They saw,” they whisper. “They saw us.”

“They did,” you say.

You keep the beacon on as long as the charge lasts. Light spills over broken roads and ruined signs, painting them in a new grammar. People arrive through the night—cautious, armed, trembling, hopeful.

No one calls it safe. No one calls it fixed.

But someone starts building a second tower on a nearby rooftop, copying your crude design. Someone else organizes a watch. The ex-teacher begins chalking letters on a cracked wall to teach the kids who appear as if conjured. The mechanic starts muttering about building a wind turbine. The old woman points out where, with patience, you could catch rain.

The world is still broken. Danger is still everywhere. Resources are still scarce.

Despite the hardships, you decide to stay.

Despite the hardships, you decide to lead.

Despite the hardships, you decide that in a place where everyone has learned to hide, the bravest, most defiant act is this:

You refuse to be small and silent in the dark.

You wake with the afterimage of that beacon behind your eyes, a memory of impossible light—and the quiet, unsettling feeling that maybe the dream wasn’t telling you how the world ends, but how it begins again.
