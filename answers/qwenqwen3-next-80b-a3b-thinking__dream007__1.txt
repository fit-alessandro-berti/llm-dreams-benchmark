The air between us crackles. Your words are sharp as shattered glassâ€”"You never *really* listen," you say, voice tight. I feel the heat rising in my own chest, my mind racing through all the times I *did* try, all the times I was there. But the words I want to sayâ€”*"Iâ€™m trying!" "We agreed on this!"*â€”stick in my throat like dry sand. The room feels too small, the walls pressing in. You turn away, shoulders rigid, and for a second, the silence is worse than the shouting.  

Then, something shifts. Not in the argument, but in the *dream itself*.  

The floor beneath us begins to dissolveâ€”not slowly, but like watercolor bleeding into ink. Solid wood turns to liquid shadow, swirling in slow, dark spirals. Weâ€™re both sinking, weightless, into an endless void. Your outstretched hand clutches at thin airâ€”not to pull away, but to reach for mine. I grab it.  

*Cold. Human. Real.*  

And in that moment, the words weâ€™ve been shouting vanishâ€”not erased, but irrelevant. The ground is gone. Thereâ€™s no winning here. No right or wrong side. Only the two of us, suspended, falling together into the dark. Your grip tightens. I feel your fingers trembling.  

**"Iâ€™m scared,"** you whisper, your voice raw. Not angry. Not defensive. Just scared.  

And I realize: *This is what we were really arguing about.* Not the job, or the money, or the anniversary. Itâ€™s the fear that weâ€™re drifting apart. That no matter how hard we fight to keep it together, the world (or our own doubts) will pull us free.  

I squeeze your hand tighter. "Me too," I say. Not as a surrender. As an offering. "But weâ€™re falling *together*."  

Suddenly, the void ignitesâ€”stars exploding around us, not cold and distant, but warm, like embers from a campfire. Falling doesnâ€™t feel like falling anymore. It feels like flying. You look at me, tears streaking your face, and laughâ€”a sound so bright it cuts through the dark. "Okay," you breathe. "Okay. Letâ€™s just... float for a while."  

And just like that, the dream softens. The stars become fireflies. The void becomes a field of tall grass under a twilight sky. Weâ€™re standing on solid ground again, but nothing is the same. The argument isnâ€™t solvedâ€”but it no longer needs to be. Weâ€™re not fighting *for* the ground beneath us anymore. Weâ€™re holding each other up.  

I wake up with my heart pounding, but my hands are still clenched tight, as if holding yours. Outside my window, the first light of dawn breaks through the trees. And for the first time in months, I know exactly what to say when I see you later: *"Letâ€™s just float for a while."*  

*(Dreams donâ€™t lie. Sometimes they show us the thing weâ€™re too afraid to say out loudâ€”while weâ€™re still awake.)* ðŸ”¥âœ¨
