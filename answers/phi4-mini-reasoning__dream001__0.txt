You find yourself in the heart of a sprawling metropolis under a surreal, ever-shifting sky. After methodically scanning for familiar cues and consulting scattered dream-logic (like cross streets that defy geography), you realize this chaos is deliberate—a test by your subconscious. With clarity dawning, you assert **"I am dreaming!"** and wield newfound control: time bends, pathways emerge from the confusion, and before doubt can creep in, you’re whisked through impossible distances to arrive at the meeting room precisely as it begins. The urgency dissolves into triumph; the challenge conquered within the dream’s boundless rules. 

Final Answer: \boxed{You} realize you're dreaming, manipulate the environment with lucid precision, and reach the meeting on time.
