…they start off like game-show stunts and gradually turn into riddles that feel pulled from the inside of your skull.

The first is easy: a buzzing timer, a spotlight, a task to stack colored blocks into a perfect miniature skyline. Your hands move without thought, and when the whistle blows, the skyline aligns with a click like a lock turning. People clap. You smile, cheeks warm, and then the host leans in, too close, and asks, “Why this city?” You look down. The blocks are labeled with names you’ve never visited but have written into a dozen cover letters: Ambition, Security, Meaning, Joy. The skyline shimmers and rearranges itself until the blocks spell your own name.

The next round happens in a hallway where the floor is a conveyor belt moving backward. Your job is to walk forward at exactly the right pace to stay centered while answering questions: “Describe a time you failed.” “What is your greatest strength?” “Where do you see yourself in five years?” The answers start off polished, then fray into honesty as the belt speeds up. “I failed when I pretended the ladder wasn’t leaning against the wrong wall,” you say, and the audience oohs like you’ve revealed a plot twist. You add, breath hitching to keep your balance, “I’m strong when I don’t know yet and say so.” The belt slows. You breathe. The lights soften like forgiveness.

A judge with an onyx pen smiles and says, “For the next challenge, you will assemble a team.” The room rolls open like a stage set, revealing people from your past waiting on folding chairs under fluorescent hum: mentors you idolized, colleagues you envied, a teacher who once told you your curiosity was a wildfire, and a younger version of you in a too-big blazer clutching a notebook like a flotation device. You walk down the line and invite three to stand. You pick the teacher, because they saw a spark. You pick a former colleague you once misread as competition, because they’re brave enough to say when they’re scared. You kneel before the younger you and whisper, “Do you want to come?” They nod, and as they stand, their blazer fits. The ones you didn’t pick cheer anyway and begin to paint a banner that reads, “We’ll be here when you need us.”

There’s a cooking segment in a kitchen with no walls. Your ingredients are verbs: Learn, Build, Listen, Lead, Rest. The recipe card says, “Make something that tastes like a life.” You sauté Listen first so everything else picks up the flavor. You fold in Learn until it disappears and reappears deeper. You sear Lead on high heat, then slice it thin so it doesn’t overpower. You set Rest on the counter like a loaf and forget it until it rises on its own. The judges take a bite and hum. “It needs more salt,” one says, and for the first time, you ask what the salt is. The audience answers in a chorus, “Boundaries.”

The final challenge is a door. It’s labeled with your dream job title in elegant script, the letters rippling like a lake. Behind it, you sense applause waiting, a desk with your nameplate, a calendar that actually fits your hours of sunlight. The host hands you a key shaped like a question mark. “Open it,” they say, “if you’re sure.” The stage quiets. The door’s peephole is a mirror. You lean in and see not your face, but a reel of moments: the night you almost quit and didn’t, the morning you changed your mind and did, the uncanny calm you feel when you’re making something that helps a stranger, the ache you carry when you’re not.

“Are you sure?” the host repeats, their voice soft now, almost your own.

You press your ear to the door and hear a muffled, laughing chaos, the kind you get when a team is happy-tired and the work makes them larger. You also hear storms: long days, hard feedback, quiet doubt. Your hand shakes. You think of the conveyor belt, the kitchen, the hallway of chairs. You think of the younger you tugging at your sleeve.

Instead of turning the key, you squat and slide it under the door. On the other side, you hear someone pick it up. The knob turns. The door opens from within.

It is not a single room but a bridge. It spans a river of years, dazzling and ordinary. On one side is where you are; on the other, a skyline of the blocks you stacked, now real and complex and under construction. The job title above the bridge unties itself into actions instead of nouns, verbs you’ve been using all along.

“Grand prize,” the host announces, “is not the job. It’s permission.”

You step onto the bridge and discover it supports you. The team you assembled walks with you. Your younger self keeps pace, pointing out things you might have missed: a heron in the reeds of routine, a stranger waving from a balcony who looks suspiciously like a future friend. You realize as you walk that every board under your foot is a small, unfancy choice you can make while awake.

At the midpoint, wind lifts your hair, and with it, something else lifts—fear slipping its coat from your shoulders. You laugh, not because everything is easy, but because you feel entirely located inside your life.

As you reach the far side, the host calls out one last instruction, smiling with all their teeth: “When you wake up, bring the verbs.” And the bridge, the river, the door, the skyline fold into a portable thing you can tuck in your pocket: a recipe card stained with salt, a key that is a question, and a banner that reads, “We’ll be here when you need us.”

You wake with your hand half-curled like it’s holding something. Maybe it is. The morning is a bright, ordinary challenge, and you know what to do. You begin.
