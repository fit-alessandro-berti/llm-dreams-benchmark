…take a deep breath and step back, letting the tension in your shoulders loosen. You decide to lower your voice instead of matching theirs, and in that moment the space around you ripples. The furniture melts into translucent shapes—a wooden chair becomes a cloud, the coffee table drifts upward like a lily pad on still water. Your friend’s face flickers between concern and confusion, as if they can’t quite decide whether to stay angry or follow you into this strange new reality.

You reach out, palm open, and the air between you hums. Colors swirl—emerald green, twilight purple, the soft glow of dawn’s first light. Your friend hesitates, their eyes widening as they feel the vibration of your calm intent. The argument’s words hang in the haze, heavy and slow, but gradually they start to unravel, each negative syllable dissolving into dust motes that drift away.

You decide to speak again—this time not to convince or to win, but to listen. Every phrase you utter forms ripples in the dreamscape: “I hear you,” you say, and a gentle rain of silver petals falls, washing away the last remnants of anger. “I know this matters to both of us,” you continue, and the petals gather into a glowing orb of shared understanding, hovering between you. 

Your friend steps forward and places their hand beside yours on the orb. The moment your fingers touch, the orb expands into a cascade of light that floods the room. You feel your heart unclench. The argument—the fear or pride that fueled it—melts into warmth. In this dream, you and your friend collapse onto the now-solid ground, laughing softly as the shifting walls of color and form fade into a peaceful morning glow.

As you both stand to leave, the world around you transforms one last time: the doorway you pass through opens onto a sunlit meadow where wildflowers dance on an unseen breeze. You turn to your friend, offer a genuine smile, and step forward together, leaving the echo of the argument behind in the realm of dreams.
