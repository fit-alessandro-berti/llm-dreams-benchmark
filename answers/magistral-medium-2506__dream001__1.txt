run frantically through the winding streets, your heart pounding as the minutes tick away. The city is a maze of towering buildings, some neon-lit and futuristic, others dark and crumbling. The air smells like rain and ozone, and distant sirens wail in the haze.

You stop a stranger—a woman in a long coat with glowing eyes—but when you ask for directions, she smiles cryptically and says, *"The meeting isn’t about where you go, but who you become."* Then she vanishes into the crowd.

Panicked, you check your pocket and find a crumpled note with a single address scrawled on it. But when you look up, the street signs are written in symbols you can’t read. A shadowy figure in a trench coat watches you from an alleyway, then beckons you closer. Do you follow?

Suddenly, your alarm blares—but when you wake up, there’s a strange symbol etched into your palm, and your phone has a missed call… from a number you don’t recognize.

(Would you like to explore a different path in the dream?)
