You reach out, and as your fingertip nears the surface, the blankness *ripples*. Not like water, but like a sigh. Where you touch, a single, warm cerulean blue blossoms—the exact color of a memory you can’t quite place. It doesn’t spread like paint, but *unfolds*, like a flower opening in reverse time.

The canvas isn’t blank anymore. It’s a window into a moment: the blue of your grandmother’s sundress on a summer afternoon, the specific hue of the sky just before a storm. But then the edges of that memory-shape begin to soften, to bleed into a swirling violet, the color of twilight and quiet困惑.

You pull your hand back, but the colors are already leaching off the canvas and into the air around you. The ground beneath your feet, which was a shifting mosaic of ochre and jade, now glimmers with flecks of that same cerulean. Your own hand looks translucent, shot through with faint, pulsing veins of gold and crimson.

The canvas, now a turbulent, beautiful storm of overlapping hues and half-formed geometries—a triangle that melts into a spiral that becomes the echo of a bird’s call—drifts away from you. It doesn’t float; it *resolves*. It becomes a door, then a face, then a single, perfect teardrop shape hovering in the air.

You realize the landscape isn’t changing *around* the canvas. The canvas is changing *because of you*. Your gaze, your breath, the faint rhythm of your heartbeat—they are the solvents and the brushes. The world is your unfinished memory, and you are both the artist and the art.

You don’t reach for it again. You just stand, in the living, breathing gallery of your own mind, as the colors find new shapes in the corners of your vision, and the blankness—the creative, terrifying, wonderful blankness—calls from every direction at once.
