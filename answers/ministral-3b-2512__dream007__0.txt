**Dream Continuation:**

The argument escalates into a storm of words—your friend’s voice sharpens, their hands clenched, while yours tremble with the weight of your own frustration. The air hums with tension, and suddenly, the walls around you *shift*, dissolving into a labyrinth of mirrored rooms. Each reflection shows a version of yourself and your friend in different states: one version is screaming, another is sobbing, and another is laughing hysterically, as if the argument is a game they’re playing.

Then, your friend’s eyes—*your friend’s eyes*—glow faintly, like embers in the dark. They reach out, and the mirror before you *snaps*. The room splits into two: one side is the familiar living room, but the other is a vast, endless plain where the sky is a swirling void of colors you can’t name. Your friend doesn’t follow you. Instead, they stand there, smiling, their voice softening: *"You’re not the only one who’s been dreaming this."*

A voice—*your own*—whispers from the edges of your mind: *"What if we’re not arguing at all?"* The words feel foreign, like a language you’ve forgotten. The argument dissolves. The air clears. And then—you’re not alone anymore. A figure steps into the light, their form shifting between solid and mist, their voice a chorus of voices: *"The truth isn’t in the fight. It’s in the space between."*

You wake up with a gasp, your sheets tangled around you, your chest still heaving. The argument from your dream lingers like a half-remembered song—so vivid, yet so *wrong*. Outside your window, the sun is setting, painting the sky in hues you’d never call "heated." And for a moment, you wonder: *Did you dream this, or did you always know it was true?*
