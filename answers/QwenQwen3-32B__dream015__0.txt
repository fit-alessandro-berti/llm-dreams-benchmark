You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to follow the faint hum of a radio signal you’ve been hearing at dawn, a melody wrapped in static that feels almost… familiar. It leads you through skeletal remains of cities, past rusted cars frozen in mid-escape, and under skies choked with ash that still glows faintly at sunset.  

The signal grows stronger near a derelict university, its glassless windows staring like empty eyes. Inside, you discover a basement lab preserved by luck or design—a greenhouse powered by solar panels, its walls lined with bioluminescent vines that cast an eerie blue glow. Tanks of algae bubble, and a weathered note on the desk reads: *“For the seeders. Keep the soil alive.”*  

You realize this is no ordinary sanctuary. The lab’s systems, though faltering, are designed to revive dormant plant species from pre-collapse seed banks. You spend days repairing what you can, your hands dirtied by soil and hope, until one night the vines bloom—soft, fragrant flowers that exude a mist carrying the scent of rain. It’s then you hear footsteps.  

A group of wanderers, gaunt and armed, approaches, their eyes fixed on the light spilling from your refuge. They’re not here to fight, though—they’ve followed the same signal, each carrying fragments of the same melody on cracked radios. Together, you trade stories: a musician, a botanist, a child who remembers more of the old world than they should.  

As dawn breaks, the greenhouse shudders. The vines pulse brighter, and a hidden door in the floor creaks open, revealing rows of seeds suspended in gel, labeled with languages you only half-recognize. The dream shifts then—a choice hangs in the air. Do you share the seeds, risking their loss to chaos, or hoard them, becoming the guardian of a secret that could rebuild—or destroy—what’s left?  

The static returns, but now it’s a question: *What grows when the last soil is sacred?* And the world holds its breath.
