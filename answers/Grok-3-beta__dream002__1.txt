the sky darkens, casting an eerie shadow over the trees. The wind picks up, rustling the leaves with an urgent whisper, as if the forest itself is warning you. You quicken your pace, searching for shelter, when you notice a faint glow in the distance—a soft, golden light flickering through the branches. Curiosity tugs at you, and despite the storm’s growing intensity, you decide to follow it. Thunder rumbles overhead, and rain begins to pelt the ground, soaking through your clothes. As you draw closer, the glow reveals itself to be a small, weathered cabin, its windows aglow with warmth. You step onto the creaky porch, and just as you raise your hand to knock, the door swings open on its own. Inside, a figure cloaked in shadow sits by a crackling fire, turning to face you with eyes that seem to hold the storm itself. "I’ve been expecting you," they say, their voice calm yet resonant, like the echo of distant thunder. You hesitate, feeling the weight of the moment, as the storm outside roars louder, urging you to step inside and uncover the mystery awaiting you.
