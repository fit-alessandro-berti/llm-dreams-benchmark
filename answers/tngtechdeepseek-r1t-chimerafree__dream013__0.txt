You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, you notice the walls begin to shift. The stone corridors ripple like liquid, rearranging themselves each time you solve a riddle, as though the maze itself is alive and testing your resolve.  

The puzzles grow more abstract—a clock with no hands demands you measure time through the rhythm of your heartbeat; a door etched with constellations only opens when you whisper a forgotten memory. Shadows flicker at the edges of your vision, morphing into half-formed faces or symbols that vanish when you turn to look.  

As you progress, the air thickens with a sense of urgency. A distant voice—your own, yet unfamiliar—echoes: *"What you seek is not the center, but the question you’ve refused to ask."* The final chamber appears, its entrance barred by a mirror. In its reflection, you don’t see yourself, but a tangled knot of light and shadow, pulsing like a riddle waiting to be unraveled.  

Do you reach out to touch it? Or do you turn back, carrying the weight of unsolved mysteries? The dream holds its breath, suspended in the space between logic and revelation.
