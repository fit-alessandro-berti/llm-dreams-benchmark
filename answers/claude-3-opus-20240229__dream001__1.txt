You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to walk down the busy street, trying to find someone who can help you. The people around you seem to be in a hurry, and no one pays attention to your pleas for assistance.

Suddenly, a mysterious figure emerges from the crowd and approaches you. The stranger is wearing a long, dark coat and a wide-brimmed hat that obscures their face. They beckon you to follow them, and with no other options, you decide to trust this enigmatic guide.

The stranger leads you through a maze of alleyways and hidden passages, deeper into the heart of the city. As you walk, the buildings around you begin to shift and change, taking on surreal and impossible shapes. The sky above you darkens, and the air grows thick with an eerie mist.

Finally, you arrive at a grand, ornate building that seems to have appeared out of nowhere. The stranger points to the entrance and then vanishes into the mist. You hesitantly approach the door and push it open, revealing a vast, dimly lit hall filled with people.

As you step inside, you realize that everyone in the room is wearing masks, and they all turn to face you. A figure at the far end of the hall rises and begins to speak, their voice echoing through the room. \ they say, \'ve been waiting for you.\

You suddenly remember that this is the meeting you were meant to attend, but as you try to recall its purpose, you find that your memory is hazy and uncertain. The masked figures begin to close in around you, their intentions unclear, and you feel a growing sense of unease. The dream begins to fade, leaving you with more questions than answers, and a lingering sense of mystery and intrigue.
