You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to head east toward the rumored "Green Haven"—a sanctuary survivors whisper about, where fresh water flows and crops still grow. Your backpack holds a rusted canteen, a knife, and a map scribbled on faded cloth. The air reeks of ash and decay, but the horizon glows faintly with a hint of dawn.  

The first days are a blur of scavenging and evasion. You siphon gasoline from abandoned cars, avoid irradiated zones marked by skeletal trees, and sleep in shifts, ears tuned to the snarls of feral dogs. Then, on a shattered highway, you find them: a child, no older than ten, and an elderly man burning a trash-can fire. Their eyes widen when they see you. "They’re coming," the man rasps, clutching a makeshift spear. "The Reapers."  

You hesitate. Helping them will slow you down, drain your supplies. But the child’s trembling hands clutch a wilted dandelion, its yellow defiant against the gray. You stay.  

When the Reapers arrive at dusk—a gang clad in jagged metal and hunger—you’re ready. The fight is brutal, a chaos of fists and fire, but you exploit their greed, luring them into a collapsed tunnel flooded with runoff. They drown in their own voracity.  

The old man dies that night, pressing the spear into your palm. "Take her," he says, nodding to the girl. "Haven’s real. Saw it… years ago." His last breath hangs in the air like a ghost.  

Now you travel as three: the girl, her silence, and you. Days later, you crest a hill. Below, a valley pulses with green—a labyrinth of solar panels, hydroponic gardens, and watchtowers manned by armed farmers. A voice shouts, "Identify yourselves!"  

You raise your hands, but the girl steps forward, her dandelion now a seed-head. She blows, and the tiny parachutes catch the wind, swirling like snow. The gate creaks open.  

Dream ends here—with hope, fragile as a breath, taking root.
