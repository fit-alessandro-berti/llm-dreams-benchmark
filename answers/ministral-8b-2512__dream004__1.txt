In your dream, the blank canvas shimmers like liquid silver under the shifting sky—its edges pulse faintly with the rhythm of the world’s ever-changing hues. As you step closer, the air hums with possibility, and the canvas seems to *breathe*, its surface rippling like water disturbed by a dropped pebble.

You reach out, and your fingers pass through it effortlessly, as if the canvas is made of starlight or the space between thoughts. Then—

**A whisper** (or is it the wind? the hum of the shifting shapes?) tugs at your mind:
*"Paint what you fear. Paint what you long for. The world will bend to the shape of your hand."*

You hesitate. The landscape around you has already begun to *react*—the jagged mountains dissolve into swirling violets, the rivers turn to liquid gold, and the sky splits open like a flower, revealing a constellation of tiny, glowing hands reaching toward you. One of them—*yours*, perhaps?—extends toward the canvas.

Your hand hovers. What do you choose?

- **A** **Fractured mirror**—reflecting not your face, but the faces of everyone you’ve ever loved, their expressions melting into something unrecognizable, beautiful, and terrifying.
- **A** **Door**—its frame woven from vines and barbed wire, its handle shaped like a keyhole that opens not into a room, but into *another version of you*, standing in this very dream, staring back.
- **A** **Voice**—not spoken, but *sung* in a language that isn’t sound but *feeling*, painting itself onto the canvas in spirals of color that make your chest ache with recognition.
- **A** **Hollow**—a perfect, geometric void where the rules of this world don’t apply. If you step inside, will you find the answer to why you’re dreaming? Or will the dream find *you*?

The canvas waits. The world shifts. And for the first time, you realize—

**You are the brush.**

What do you paint?
