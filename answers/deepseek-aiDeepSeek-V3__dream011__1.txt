written in a language you’ve never seen before. The symbols are swirling on the page, shifting and rearranging as if alive. You feel a surge of panic, but then you notice something strange—your hand is moving on its own, scribbling answers effortlessly in the same incomprehensible script. 

You glance around the room and see your classmates staring blankly at their papers, their faces pale and confused. The professor, standing at the front of the room, is watching you intently with a knowing smile. Their eyes seem to glow faintly, and you realize they’re not entirely human.

Suddenly, the exam paper rises into the air, hovering before you. The symbols detach from the page, swirling around your head like a halo. You hear a voice, deep and resonant, whispering in your mind: "This is not a test of knowledge, but of perception. What do you truly see?"

As you ponder this, the room begins to dissolve, the desks and chairs melting into a swirling void of colors and shapes. The only thing that remains is the exam paper, now blank except for a single question written in your own handwriting: *"Who are you?"* 

You wake up with a start, the question echoing in your mind, as if the dream was only the beginning of a much deeper journey.
