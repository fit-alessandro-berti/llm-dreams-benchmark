…you begin to open your mouth, confident that the perfect words are about to flow.

But instead of words, what comes out is a single, perfect, crystalline note—like a wine glass being rubbed at exactly the right frequency. The note hangs in the air, shimmering, and the entire audience freezes mid-breath. Their eyes widen. The note grows louder, richer, until it fills the auditorium like golden light.

Then the second note follows. And the third.

You realize, with the calm acceptance that only exists in dreams, that you are no longer giving a speech. You are singing an aria you have never learned, in a language that predates Babel, and every soul in the hall understands it perfectly. Tears stream down their faces—not from sadness, but from recognition, as if they are remembering something they never knew they forgot.

Your feet leave the stage. You rise slowly, arms outstretched, still singing. The ceiling dissolves into starlight. The audience rises with you, not flying exactly, but unmoored from gravity, gently ascending in perfect silence except for your voice holding them all together like a thread of molten glass.

You reach the climax of the song—a note so pure it has color—and in that instant every person in the crowd looks directly into your eyes at once. Ten thousand gazes, yet it feels like one. They smile the kind of smile people give when they finally come home after lifetimes away.

The final note fades.

You descend together, softly, until everyone’s feet touch the floor again. The lights come up normally. The ceiling is just a ceiling again.

The audience sits in stunned silence for three full heartbeats.

Then they applaud—not the polite clapping of obligation, but the roaring, feet-stamping, soul-deep ovation of people who have just been allowed to remember they have wings.

You bow, a little embarrassed, because you still have no idea what just happened.

As you walk offstage, someone in the front row whispers, loud enough for you to hear:

“Thank you for reminding us.”

And just before the dream dissolves, you catch your reflection in a darkened window backstage.

You’re wearing a tuxedo made of midnight.

And you’re smiling like you’ve known the secret all along.
