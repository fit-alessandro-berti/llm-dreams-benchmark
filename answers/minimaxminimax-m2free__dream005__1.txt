You’re standing in a sprawling ballroom whose ceiling seems to stretch indefinitely, a lattice of crystal chandeliers that sway like upside‑down jellyfish, their light rippling in slow, warm waves. The floor is a mosaic of old photographs—some of strangers, some of faces you think you might have seen in a dream before—each tile shifting slightly under your feet as you step, as if the ground itself is trying to remember the past.

You know exactly who you’re looking for: Maya, the one person in this sea of strangers whose smile you could recognize even if it were painted on a cloud. She’s the only anchor you have in this strange, floating world, and you push through the crowds, following the faint, lingering scent of citrus that clings to her whenever she laughs.

The first group you stumble upon is a circle of people in Victorian costumes, their faces obscured by ornate masquerade masks that seem to hum with a low, metallic buzz. They’re discussing a grand ball that took place a century ago, yet their words spill out like a modern-day debate about quantum physics. One of them—an elegant lady with a feathered plume—asks you, “Do you know the secret of time?” You shake your head, and they hand you a pocket watch that ticks backward, its hands moving in a slow, hypnotic dance. As you turn it over, the watch’s face dissolves into a map of winding rivers, each tributary glowing with a different hue.

Beyond them, a troupe of jazz musicians in suits made of shifting denim plays on a stage made of floating clouds. Their instruments are half‑wood, half‑glass, and the music sounds like rain falling on a tin roof—each note echoing in a different room of the house you used to live in as a child. A saxophonist with a golden mouthpiece waves you over, gesturing toward a door at the far side of the stage that flickers between a fire exit and a doorway to a garden you’ve never seen before.

You step through, and the world changes. The ballroom’s marble walls become vines, and the chandeliers bloom into flowers that release soft sighs of fragrance. Here, you find a group of children playing hopscotch on a tiled courtyard that expands endlessly, each square marking a different memory of yours: your first bike ride, the day you learned to swim, the night you got lost in the woods and heard a lark’s song. One child, with hair the color of midnight and eyes like twin moons, looks up at you and smiles. It’s Maya—older now, but unmistakably her, her eyes crinkling with the same mischief you remember from your childhood games.

She says, “I’ve been waiting for you. The dance has many rooms, but it only ends when you decide to stop looking.” She takes your hand, and the pocket watch you’d taken earlier disappears, replaced by a bracelet of tiny bells that ring in harmony with the music now swelling from every corner of this enchanted space.

As the two of you begin to move, the dream shifts again: the room dissolves into a forest clearing under a sky that’s a canvas of swirling auroras. You and Maya dance among fireflies that blink in Morse code, spelling out words you can’t quite read but feel deep in your chest. The ground beneath you is soft moss that hums like a heartbeat, and every step you take sends ripples through the air, as if you’re parting waves in an invisible sea.

Suddenly, the world hushes. A low, resonant voice whispers from the darkness: “Remember where you came from, and where you belong.” The voice is yours, echoing from a mirror you hadn’t seen before, a mirror that reflects not your body but the thoughts you’ve never spoken aloud. In its surface, you see not a dream but a memory: a summer night in your childhood backyard, Maya and you lying on a blanket, the sky a tapestry of stars, both of you promising to always find each other, no matter how far the night stretched.

You turn back toward Maya, but she’s already a silhouette dissolving into the light of the aurora. Yet, in the distance, you hear her voice—soft, distant, yet unmistakable—calling your name, inviting you forward into the next part of the dream. As you step toward that promise, the room around you begins to shift once more, each new scene a new layer of the endless story you’re living in your sleep.

You take a breath, feeling the cool, electric charge of the dream’s air, and with a smile, you let the night carry you onward, knowing that somewhere, in the depth of this vast, ever‑changing gathering, Maya’s laughter is waiting.
