…in a language you don’t recognize. At first, it looks like familiar symbols, but as you focus, the letters twist and rearrange themselves into elegant, looping script you’ve never seen before. A low hum of panic starts in your chest, but you force yourself to breathe.

You glance around the room. The other students are writing furiously, heads down, their pens scratching in a steady, confident rhythm. No one else seems confused. The professor at the front of the room gives you a slow, unreadable smile and taps the face of their wristwatch.

You look back at the paper. This time, you don’t try to read the words. Instead, you stare at the white space between the lines. And there, as if emerging from a mist, you see faint, shimmering diagrams—circuits, chemical structures, poetic verses, architectural blueprints—all layered atop one another. They pulse with a soft, golden light.

You realize this isn’t a test of knowledge. It’s a test of perception. The questions aren’t meant to be *read*; they’re meant to be *seen through*.

You pick up your pen. Instead of writing an answer, you begin to trace one of the glowing diagrams onto your blank answer sheet. As the line closes, completing a circuit, the entire page glows brightly. The foreign script fades away, replaced by a single sentence in your native tongue:

***"What you seek is not on the page, but in the pattern you choose to complete."***

You wake up then, not with a start, but with a slow, dawning clarity, the feeling of the pen still warm in your hand.
