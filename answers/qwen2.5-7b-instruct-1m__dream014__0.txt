feel a surge of unexpected warmth. At first, you're hesitant, unsure whether to trust these strangers or not. But something in their eyes—perhaps it's the genuine concern, or maybe it's the simple fact that they seem genuinely interested in helping—makes you feel safe.

One of them, a woman with kind eyes and a gentle smile, gestures for you to follow her. She leads you through narrow, winding streets, pointing out landmarks and explaining the layout of the city. Another person, a man with a reassuring voice, offers practical advice on how to navigate the area more efficiently. A few others join in, offering words of encouragement or sharing stories of their own experiences in the city.

As you walk, you realize that each stranger has a unique perspective, but they all share a common goal: to help you find your way. They don't ask for anything in return, and their kindness feels both unexpected and deeply appreciated. You begin to feel less lost, less alone.

At one point, you stop to thank them, and they laugh gently, saying, "We were just happy to help." In that moment, you realize that the city isn't as overwhelming as you thought. The people here, despite the hustle and bustle, are warm and welcoming.

The dream shifts slightly, and you find yourself standing in a small, cozy café. The same strangers are there, sitting at a table together, sipping coffee and chatting. You join them, and the conversation flows effortlessly. You learn about their lives, their dreams, and the reasons they chose this city. In turn, you share a little about yourself.

Time seems to stretch, but in a good way. You feel connected to these strangers in a way that feels both surreal and profoundly real. As the sun begins to set outside the café, casting a golden glow through the windows, you realize that this dream isn't just about finding your way in the city—it's about finding a sense of belonging.

When you wake up, you carry a small piece of that feeling with you, a reminder that even in the most chaotic places, there are people willing to offer a hand, a word of kindness, or a listening ear.
