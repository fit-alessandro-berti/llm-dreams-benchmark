You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a handwriting you recognize—yours, but tighter, more careful, like you were trying not to be found out. The ink gleams as if it’s still wet.

The first page isn’t multiple choice. It’s a map.

Not of a country or a campus. A map of the building you’re in, drawn from above, with the exam hall marked as a small, shaded square. At the top of the page, printed in the same careful script, it says:

**BEGIN WHERE YOU ARE.**

A proctor glides past without footsteps. Their face is blurred the way faces blur in old photographs, except for the mouth, which smiles too widely. They set a timer on your desk. It’s an hourglass, but the sand falls upward.

You turn to the next page.

1. **Define success. Show your work.**

The lines beneath it are already filled in with your own writing. You read it anyway. It says:

*Success is reaching the door before it disappears.*

You glance up. At the far end of the hall, there’s a door you hadn’t noticed before—tall, dark, with a brass plate that simply reads **AFTER**. It is slightly ajar, and from the gap comes the sound of your name being spoken in a voice you almost recognize.

You flip forward, heart thudding.

2. **Calculate the weight of a decision. Use the standard unit.**

Below it: *1 regret = 7 years.*

You blink. The letters wobble like they’re floating on water. The standard unit is circled and underlined three times. **REGRET**. Your throat tightens like you’ve swallowed something that refuses to go down.

A pencil appears beside your hand. You don’t remember reaching for it. It’s already sharpened. The wood smells like cedar, clean and comforting in a way that makes you suddenly want to cry.

You try to write something—anything—and the pencil scratches across the page, but the marks come out as a sound. A soft, whispering sound. Like someone speaking through a wall.

Around you, other students bend over their desks, furiously writing. Their papers rustle like leaves in wind. One person looks up, and instead of eyes they have tiny clock faces, all set to different times.

You turn another page, desperate for something normal.

3. **Choose one:**  
A) The job you planned for.  
B) The job your parents wanted.  
C) The job you think you deserve.  
D) The job you’re afraid you’ll love.

You stare at the options until the letters begin to rearrange themselves, swapping places like nervous feet. Your pencil hovers. The proctor’s shadow stretches across your desk, too long, too thin.

“I can’t,” you whisper, but the whisper lands on the paper as ink.

The answer box fills itself in.

**D.**

You slam the booklet shut, and the sound echoes like a gavel. A few heads turn. The clock-faced student tilts their head, ticking quietly.

The proctor leans down until their blurred face is inches from yours. “No talking,” they say, but their voice is your own, recorded and played back wrong.

You open the booklet again, because in dreams you always do what the dream wants.

The next page is blank except for a single instruction:

**TURN TO PAGE 0.**

There is no page zero. You flip backward anyway. The page numbers dissolve, sliding off the corners like melting wax. The paper grows warmer, like skin.

When you reach the front again, the cover has changed. The title is embossed in gold:

**FINAL EXAM: YOU**

You look down at your hands. They’re smudged with graphite, and there are tiny printed numbers along your knuckles, like a catalog. Your pulse seems to make them shimmer.

From the door marked **AFTER**, a thin strip of light spills across the floor. It moves like something alive, inching toward you. As it passes beneath desks, it makes faint, pleasant sounds—like a successful email sending, like applause heard through walls, like the click of a lock opening.

The proctor taps the hourglass. The sand—still falling upward—has almost reached the top.

You turn one more page.

4. **Write your name.**

That’s it. No trick. No options. Just a long blank line.

You grip the pencil so hard your fingers ache. You begin to write, and for the first time the pencil behaves like a pencil.

But halfway through the first letter, it changes. Your name comes out wrong. Not misspelled—different. A name you almost had. A name that belongs to a version of you that took a different turn years ago.

You freeze.

Behind you, chairs scrape back in unison. Everyone is standing. All at once. A synchronized, terrible courtesy. They face the door marked **AFTER** as if waiting to be called.

The proctor whispers, “Time.”

The hourglass flips itself over. The sand pauses in midair, suspended like dust in sunlight.

Your paper is heavy now. The booklet tugs at your wrists like it wants to be carried somewhere. The map from the first page seeps through the other pages as if the ink is bleeding, and you see it clearly: a path drawn from your desk to the door, traced in your handwriting. Along the path are tiny notes, like reminders.

*Don’t look back.*  
*Don’t apologize.*  
*Take your pencil.*  
*Leave something behind.*

You stand too, because your legs have decided for you. The chair’s metal legs squeal. Every head in the room turns—not to you, but to where you were sitting, as if that seat has become more interesting than any person.

You step into the aisle.

The light-strip reaches your shoes and curls around them, tugging gently, insistently, like a leash made of warmth.

At the front of the room, beside the proctor’s desk, there’s a tray labeled **SUBMIT HERE**. It isn’t a tray at all but a shallow slot in the air, like a mailbox cut into nothing. Inside it, papers drift in slow circles, each one covered in frantic handwriting, each one pulsing faintly, like moth wings.

You hesitate with your booklet in hand.

The proctor’s blurred face tilts. “You can’t take it with you,” they say softly. “That’s the point.”

You look at the booklet. Then at the door. Then back at the long line of students, all waiting, all quiet, their clock-faces ticking different futures into the same room.

You slide the booklet toward the slot.

At the last second, you tear out a single page—the map—and fold it into your pocket. The paper is warm against your thigh, like a secret.

The rest of the booklet disappears into the slot without a sound.

The door marked **AFTER** opens wider, exhaling a breath of cold air that smells faintly of new paint and rain.

You walk.

With each step, the exam hall stretches, elongating like a hallway in an old cartoon. The fluorescent lights above flicker and become stars. The hum of the room turns into distant ocean surf. Your shoes make no sound now, as if the floor has decided to forgive you.

When you reach the threshold, you pause.

On the other side is not a workplace, not a stage, not a desk with your name on it.

It’s a small, quiet room with a single window. Outside the window, morning is beginning. Not the morning you know, but a morning that looks undecided—gray-blue, holding its breath.

On the windowsill is a pencil cup. Inside it: one pencil, already sharpened.

Beside it lies a blank sheet of paper.

And on that paper, in your own careful handwriting, is a final question you don’t remember writing:

**5. What will you do when nobody is grading you?**

You turn to look back, to see if the exam hall is still there, if the proctor is watching, if the clock-faced students have moved.

But there is only the closed door behind you now, and the brass plate has changed.

It no longer reads **AFTER**.

It reads:

**START.**

You inhale. The air tastes like possibility and dust.

In your pocket, the folded map presses warmly against your leg, as if reminding you that you can still choose where to go.

You pick up the pencil.

And just as the graphite touches the paper, you wake—heart racing, hand clenched as if still holding something—certain, for a lingering moment, that you left an answer unfinished in a room that is still waiting for you.
