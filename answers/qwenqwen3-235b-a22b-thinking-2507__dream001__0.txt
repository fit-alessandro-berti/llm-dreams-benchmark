You start to **run, but your legs feel heavy, like wading through wet cement. The city breathes around youâ€”streets stretch longer when you blink, and towering buildings shift like sand dunes in a silent wind. You pull out your phone, but the screen is a mosaic of broken glass, showing only the time: 59 minutes left. Panic claws your throat.**

You spot a street vendor selling steaming paper cranes. "Where's the meeting?" you gasp. He hands you a crane made of crumpled train tickets. "Follow the pigeons," he murmurs, his voice echoing as if from a canyon. You look upâ€”the sky is suddenly *full* of pigeons, all flying toward a clock tower with melting hands. You sprint after them, weaving through crowds of faceless people carrying umbrellas that drip ink.  

**Then the ground tilts.**  
You slide down a sudden slope of cobbled stones, tumbling into an alley where the walls are lined with flickering TVs showing static. One screen glitches to life: *Your childhood bedroom.* On the bed sits a tiny, grinning clockwork rabbit. It chimesâ€”a sound like shattering porcelainâ€”and points a brass paw toward a door you hadnâ€™t noticed.  

**You burst through the doorâ€”**  
â€”and freeze. Youâ€™re in a sunlit garden, not a city. A wrought-iron table holds a single teacup. Across from it sits *your future self*, older, calm, wearing your favorite shirt. They smile, push the teacup toward your empty chair. "Youâ€™re early," they say, sliding a blueprint across the table. Itâ€™s a map of the cityâ€¦ but itâ€™s drawn on your *skin*, pulsing like a heartbeat.  

**The meeting wasnâ€™t a job. It was you.**  
To remember who you are.  

The clock tower chimes in the distanceâ€”*dingâ€¦ dingâ€¦*â€”but the sound is the slow beat of your own pulse. You pick up the teacup. Steam rises, smelling of rain and old libraries. Outside the garden wall, the city roars like a subway train.  

You take a sip. The cup is empty, but warm. And for the first time, youâ€™re not afraid of the clock.  

*(You wake up with the taste of chamomile on your tongue, the blueprint fading from your wrist like a half-remembered tattoo. The "important meeting"? It was just a doctorâ€™s appointment. But for a moment, the dream lingersâ€”and you smile anyway.)*  

---  
*Dream logic decoded:* Cities = lifeâ€™s chaos. Melting clocks = time anxiety. Paper cranes = fragile hope. Future self = inner wisdom. The real meeting? A reminder that sometimes what "matters" is just showing up for yourself. ðŸ˜‰
