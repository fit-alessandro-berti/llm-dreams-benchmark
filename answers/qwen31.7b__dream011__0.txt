As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are **mystical**, their wording twisting like riddles, each one a portal to a forgotten chapter of your life. They ask not just facts but *why* you chose your path, *what* you fear, and *who* you’re truly meant to be. The pen in your hand feels heavier than it should, as if the weight of your soul is on the paper. You glance at the clock—*3:47 a.m.*—and realize the exam is not just a test of knowledge but a reckoning of your fears, desires, and the courage to face them. The questions are not just about answers; they’re about *you*. And as you begin, you feel a strange clarity, as if the exam is not a test, but a mirror reflecting the truth you’ve been seeking all along. 🍀✨
