...and you feel a sudden surge of anxiety wash over you. The ticking of the clock on the wall grows louder, each second echoing in your ears like a countdown. Determined not to disappoint, you rush to your desk and flip open your laptop, but the screen remains blank. Frantically, you press the keys, but they melt under your fingertips like warm wax.

Confused, you look around the office and notice that your coworkers are moving in slow motion, their faces expressionless, eyes fixed forward. The fluorescent lights overhead flicker and hum, casting strange shadows that dance along the walls. Your boss clears their throat, drawing your attention back. "We're all counting on you," they say, their voice distorted and echoing unnaturally.

Panicking, you grab a pen and paper, but the words refuse to form. The letters float off the page and scatter into the air like tiny insects. Just then, the floor beneath you begins to ripple like water. You try to steady yourself, but gravity seems to have shifted. Objects around you start floating upwards—chairs, files, even the potted plants drift toward the ceiling.

Realizing that something is amiss, you take a deep breath and try to calm down. "This can't be real," you whisper to yourself. Suddenly, a window bursts open, and a gust of wind carries you out into the open sky. You're weightless, floating among the clouds, the vast cityscape sprawling beneath you.

As you soar higher, the impossible deadline and the stress of the office fade away. You feel a sense of freedom and empowerment. The sky around you fills with shimmering constellations, and you reach out to touch them. Each star you grasp transforms into an idea, a solution to the project that once seemed insurmountable.

With newfound confidence, you descend gently back to your workplace. The office has transformed into a vibrant, dynamic space filled with light and creativity. Your coworkers cheer as you walk by, and your boss greets you with a genuine smile. "I knew you could do it," they say.

You sit down at your desk, and this time, everything works flawlessly. Your fingers fly over the keyboard as the project comes together effortlessly. Time seems to expand, giving you all the moments you need. As you finish, a feeling of accomplishment fills you.

The sound of applause surrounds you, and you stand to take a bow. But as you do, the office fades away, and you find yourself back in your bed, the morning sun peeking through the curtains. You wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on any challenge the day might bring.
