You feel a storm approaching and the air thickens with electricity, making the hairs on your arms stand up. The once-gentle rustling of leaves turns into a frantic whisper, then a howl as wind tears through the canopy. Sunlight vanishes, swallowed by bruise-purple clouds that pulse with silent lightning.

You break into a run, boots slipping on damp mossy roots, the path dissolving into shadow. Rain doesn't fall—it *attacks*, cold needles stinging your skin, turning the forest floor into a slick, sucking mire. Thunder cracks directly overhead, not a sound, but a physical blow that vibrates your bones. You stumble, falling hard against the massive, gnarled trunk of an ancient oak.

As you scramble back, gasping, your hand sinks into something impossibly dry and warm where the rain had soaked the earth. You pull back, not soil, but coarse, golden *hair*. The oak's bark beneath your palm shifts, groaning like stressed timber. You look up, heart hammering against your ribs.

The trunk *unfolds*. Bark becomes weathered skin, deep fissures forming a face colossal and sorrowful, branches creaking into long, knotted limbs rooted deep in the trembling earth. Rain streams down its vast, moss-bearded cheeks like tears. Its eyes, deep-set hollows darker than the storm, open – not with malice, but with an ancient, weary recognition, locking onto yours.

**"Child,"** its voice is the groan of tectonic plates, the sigh of a mountain, echoing inside your skull rather than in the air. **"You walk the dreaming roots. The storm is not *in* the sky... it is *in* the world. They are digging. Deeper. Closer."**

It raises a limb the size of a fallen sequoia, not to strike, but pointing west, towards the distant, unseen edge of the woods. Where it points, the lashing rain seems to... *thin*? No, not thin. It flows *around* something – a faint, shimmering spiral of light, barely visible, like a heat haze in reverse, hanging just above the saturated ground.

**"The wound bleeds,"** the Tree-Giant rumbles, a tremor running through its form and shuddering up your spine. **"They seek the heart. Silence it. But the dream... the deep dream... it fights back. It sent *you* here. To see. To remember."**

Another thunderclap splits the sky, but this one feels artificial, metallic – the shriek of grinding gears, not nature. The Tree-Giant flinches, a crack splitting its shoulder. Its massive eyes dim, the ancient sorrow deepening into pain.

**"Go,"** it whispers, the sound fading like wind through reeds. **"Find the spiral. Touch the wound. Before they silence the roots... and the dream... dies..."**

Its form begins to dissolve, bark flowing back into wood, limbs retracting into the trunk. The rain still hammers down, but the colossal presence is gone, leaving only the sodden, trembling oak and the echoing command in your mind. Before you, the faint, shimmering spiral pulses weakly, a beacon in the drowning grey. The metallic screech echoes again, closer this time. You take a breath, the storm filling your lungs, and push forward, towards the light.
