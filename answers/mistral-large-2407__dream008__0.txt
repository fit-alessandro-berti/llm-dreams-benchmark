As you sit at your desk, the clock hands begin to spin wildly, the minutes and hours blurring together. You open the project folder, and the papers inside are blank, but they start to fill with text in a language you've never seen before. The characters dance and shift on the page, making it impossible to focus.

You look up, and your workplace has transformed. The cubicles have turned into a vast, ever-changing maze. The walls are made of towering stacks of papers and folders, and the fluorescent lights above flicker ominously, casting long, dancing shadows.

Your boss, now a talking alarm clock with legs, scuttles over to you, its alarm ringing loudly. "Tick-tock, tick-tock!" it shouts, "The deadline is approaching! You're running out of time!"

You start to run through the maze, clutching the project folder. Every time you turn a corner, you encounter strange obstacles: a coffee machine that spits out steaming streams of post-it notes, a copy machine that duplicates anything except the documents you need, and colleagues who are now various office supplies, offering advice in languages you can't understand.

In the distance, you see a glowing exit sign. You make a final dash towards it, leaping over rolling office chairs and sliding across slick floors covered in scattered papers. As you reach the door, you look back. The maze has disappeared, and your workplace is back to normal. Your boss, human once again, smiles at you from across the room.

You wake up with a start, your heart pounding. You look at your actual project folder on your desk, relieved that you still have time to complete it. The dream has left you with a renewed sense of urgency, but also a sense of the absurd, reminding you that even the most stressful tasks can be conquered one step at a time.
