As you wake up from your sleep, feeling disoriented and anxious about finding your way to the meeting, you decide to take some steps to ensure you don't get lost.

1. Check your phone: Look for maps or GPS directions to help navigate through the city.
2. Ask for directions: Locate a store, Starbucks, or even a stranger who can guide you to the meeting location.
3. Research online: Search for the address of the meeting place or nearby landmarks that might help you find it quickly.

Waking up in this unfamiliar situation and realizing your need for direction can be stressful and mentally exhausting. It's essential to stay calm, organized, and resourceful when facing such challenges to minimize stress and anxiety before starting the day.

Remember, as soon as you wake up from this dream, remember to breathe deeply and take a moment to organize yourself mentally and physically before starting your day.
