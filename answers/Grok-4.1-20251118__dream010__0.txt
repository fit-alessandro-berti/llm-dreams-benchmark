You are dreaming.

You are participating in a competition where the grand prize is your dream job. As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and, somehow, every single one feels eerily tailored to the secret fears and hopes you’ve never told anyone.

First round: a silent room where you have to build a perfect replica of the childhood home you lost (or never had). The pieces keep shifting when you look away, walls breathing like they remember arguments you’ve forgotten. You finish it anyway, fingers bleeding light.

Second round: a conversation with every version of yourself that gave up. They sit across a candlelit table, sipping from cups that refill with your own excuses. You have to convince them, one by one, that you’re different now. The youngest one cries when you hug her. The oldest one just nods and vanishes like smoke.

Third round: they hand you a mirror and tell you to fight the reflection. It knows every self-sabotage you’ve ever committed. It blocks your punches with your own past failures made solid. You win by dropping your fists and saying, out loud, “I forgive you.” The mirror cracks into a doorway.

Now the final challenge.

The arena is infinite black water under a starless sky. Floating in the center is a single chair and a desk. On the desk: a contract for your dream job. The catch—they won’t let you sign it until you sit down and write, in detail, the exact moment you will inevitably ruin everything and quit.

The pen is warm, almost alive. It wants you to write the story of your future failure so badly.

You sit.

You stare at the blank page.

Hours pass, or seconds—time is slippery here.

Finally, you write a single sentence:

“I might fail, but I refuse to pre-write the ending for you.”

You turn the paper over, sign the back with your real name—the one your parents whispered when you were born, the one no résumé has ever carried—and you fold it into a boat.

You set it on the water.

The black water ignites into sunrise.

The desk rises like an elevator made of light. Higher, higher, until you’re standing on solid ground again, but the ground is the rooftop of the building you’ve always imagined your dream office would be in.

Someone—maybe the host, maybe yourself—hands you a keycard with your name already on it.

You don’t feel triumphant. You feel… quiet. Like you’ve just woken up inside the dream and realized you no longer need it to tell you who you are.

The alarm clock starts buzzing in the distance, but you’re not ready to leave yet.

You walk to the edge of the roof, look out over the city that hasn’t been built yet, and whisper:

“See you on Monday.”

Then the dream lets you go.
