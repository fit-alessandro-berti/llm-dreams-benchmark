...realize the wheel in your hands isn't made of wood at all. It's bone, smooth and cold, and it seems to hum with a low, mournful song. The crew's faces aren't just filled with fear; they are shifting, becoming the faces of every person you've ever felt responsible for: your parents, a childhood friend, a teacher who believed in you. Their eyes are wide and pleading.

The roar of the storm is no longer just wind and thunder. It's a voice, a deep and ancient thing, and it's laughing at you. A colossal wave, taller than any mast, crests before the ship, but it doesn't look like water. It's a wall of shimmering, obsidian glass, and in its reflection, you see not your ship, but your childhood bedroom.

Your first mate, whose face is now that of your grandfather, shouts, "Captain, what are your orders?" but his voice is a cascade of falling teacups.

You let go of the bone-wheel. The logical part of your mind screams that this is suicide, but this is a dream, and logic is a stowaway here. You turn to face your crew of familiar ghosts. You don't shout orders to fight the storm. Instead, you begin to conduct it.

Your hands, once gripping the wheel, now sweep through the air. With a slow, graceful arc of your arm, you quiet the shrieking wind into a sorrowful cello solo. With a sharp flick of your fingers, you command the lightning to strike the sea in a percussive rhythm, illuminating the water from below. The rain softens from a deluge to a gentle pizzicato on the deck.

The colossal wave of glass hangs suspended, quivering. You walk towards it, your boots making no sound. You reach out and touch its surface. It's not cold, but warm, like skin. The image of your bedroom dissolves, replaced by a sky filled with swimming constellations.

You turn back to your crew. Their faces are no longer fearful, but filled with a quiet awe. They are not looking at a captain fighting a storm, but at a composer finishing a symphony. The sea is calm, the ship is still, and in the sudden silence, you hear the distant sound of a ringing telephone, pulling you up, up, up from the deep.
