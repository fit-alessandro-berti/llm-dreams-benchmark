overhear snippets of their conversations—some familiar, some completely nonsensical. One group discusses an upcoming space expedition, another argues over the correct way to pronounce a word that keeps changing every time they say it. 

You navigate through the crowd, weaving between surreal vignettes. A waiter offers you a tray of glowing fruit, claiming it will help you remember something important. Before you can take one, a woman with shimmering, translucent skin gently grabs your wrist.

You feel a strange pull, as though the world around you is tilting. The music shifts, turning into a melody you almost recognize but can't quite place. Then, you finally spot the person you're looking for at the far end of the room. 

They're facing away from you, speaking to someone whose face remains blurry no matter how hard you focus. As you approach, the room begins to stretch impossibly long, the distance between you and them growing wider with every step. 

Then, your name is called—loud and clear. The room freezes. Everyone turns to look at you.
