The air hums with possibilities—each breath sends ripples through the air, altering colors within a meter. Desperate to create something permanent in this fleeting world, you press the tip to the blank canvas.  

The moment your brush touches the surface, the entire ground shifts. Pink waves ripple forward, then dissolve into a burst of sapphire, gold, and indigo. Your strokes—flicks of the wrist meant to etch permanence—become transient ripples instead. The paint you dispense from the brush transforms mid-flight: crimson becomes a flickering neon, azure evolves into a solid obsidian.  

The canvas itself seems to *breathe*, forming shapes that shift faster than your eyes can follow. A giant, faceted dragon appears, its scales shifting from ivory to molten charcoal every heartbeat. Then, it whirls its claw at you, just as the colors around it destabilize into a vortex of light.
