You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the trees that had whispered like old friends all day now shiver with a sudden, electric tension. 

First, the sky swirls from a soft, honey‑gold haze into a deep, bruised violet, thickening with low, humming clouds that roll across the canopy like a massive, slow‑breathing beast. Leaves rustle in a frantic, staccato rhythm, and the sweet fragrance of pine gives way to a sharp, metallic smell—like ozone and rain that has yet to fall. 

A cold wind kicks up, snatching at your coat, scattering loose pine needles into a wild vortex around your head. You glance up and see jagged bolts of lightning branching out, not just across the heavens but also threading through the branches themselves, turning the trees into a glittering lattice of trembling light. The thunder rolls low and resonant, a drumbeat that seems to emanate from the earth itself, urging you forward.

You press farther into the woods, the soft underbrush turning slick with a thin sheen of rain that begins to fall in heavy sheets. The world blurs: each step is a splash of mud that splatters on your shoes, each breath is a gasp of cold, damp air. Yet even as the storm rages, you notice something strange—an impossible glow pulsing from the center of the forest, a warm amber hue that pushes back against the darkness. 

Drawn by that light, you part the thickening boughs and come upon a clearing you never saw before, although you swear you have traversed this forest for years. In the middle of the clearing stands a massive, ancient oak, its bark split by the storm’s fury, yet a tiny door, no larger than a leaf, has opened at its base. From the doorway spills a soft, golden flame that dances without consuming the air, casting silhouettes of hidden things onto the surrounding trunks.

A voice—perhaps the wind, perhaps the oak itself—whispers through the rustle of leaves: “When the storm arrives, the world remembers its hidden song.” The note of the voice is both a promise and a question. You step closer, feeling the hum of the forest rise in a new pitch, as if the trees are straining to sing.

Then, as if on cue, the storm shifts again. The rain becomes a curtain of silver beads that cascade over the ancient oak, each droplet ringing like tiny bells. The lightning retreats, pulling back into the clouds, but the thunder does not vanish; it softens, turning into a low, steady hum that matches the rhythm of a heartbeat. The wind, now gentler, wraps around you like a mother’s sigh, and the forest seems to breathe with you.

You close your eyes, allowing the storm’s lingering vibration to lull you deeper into the dream. In the darkness behind your lids, you see the forest’s secret: a river of light winding through the roots, a path of luminous moss that leads beyond the trees, into a place where day and night intertwine. You feel the pull of that hidden song, a melody that has always existed beneath the bark and beneath the clouds, waiting for a traveler to hear it.

When you finally open your eyes, the storm has passed. The forest is drenched, every leaf glistening like a thousand tiny mirrors. The ancient oak stands still, its door closed, but a single ember of that golden flame still flickers low on a branch, a reminder that even after the most violent weather, the heart of the forest—its quiet, unseen music—remains, ready to be discovered anew whenever you step back into the dream.
