...walk faster, pulse thrumming in your ears as the skyline shifts—buildings tilt like melting wax, their windows blinking like sleepy eyes. You pull out your phone, but the screen shows only a blank clock frozen at 10:59. A street vendor hands you a map made of folded origami; when you unfold it, it’s a sketch of your childhood bedroom. That’s when you notice the shoes in your bag aren’t yours—soft leather loafers with a familiar monogram. Wait. *Your boss wears those.*

Your stomach drops.

You dial your assistant, but the call connects to your high school locker. The voice on the other end whispers, *“Turn around.”*

You do. The city folds inward like a collapsing stage set, and suddenly you’re standing outside a glass conference room. Inside, everyone at the table is you—different versions, in different suits, all staring at the empty seat at the head of the table.

And then you hear it—a faint *ping*—the elevator behind you opening.

Who steps out?

(What happens next?)
