You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and **the air grows thick, heavy with the scent of ozone and damp earth. The gentle rustling of leaves transforms into a frantic, whipping dance, as the wind begins to howl like a hungry beast. Looking up, you see the once-azure sky churning, swallowed by monstrous, bruised-purple clouds that roil and boil like a cauldron. Giant, inky fingers reach down, clawing at the treetops.

Panic flares in your chest, a cold, sharp spike. You need to find shelter, and fast. The trees, once welcoming and serene, now seem menacing, their branches skeletal arms that threaten to snatch at you.  You stumble over exposed roots, the forest floor suddenly treacherous. Rain begins to fall, not in gentle drops, but in thick, stinging sheets, instantly soaking you to the bone.

Through the downpour, you glimpse a flicker of light, a small, warm glow almost swallowed by the gloom. Hope surges, desperate and fierce. You push towards it, battling the wind that tries to rip you backwards, the rain that blinds you, the fear that threatens to paralyze you.  Is it a cabin? A cave? Something… else? You can't tell, but the light is your only beacon in this swirling, savage chaos, and you cling to the promise of safety it offers with every fiber of your being.**
