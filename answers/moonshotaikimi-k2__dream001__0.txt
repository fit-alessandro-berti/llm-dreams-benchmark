—panic first, of course. A sharp spike in your chest, the way wings beat inside your ribs.  
The city’s streets bubble with reflections, and every storefront mirror shows you a different face—older, younger, none quite yours—so you stop looking. One hour. One meeting. The details swirl behind a gauze curtain you can’t quite push aside: a name that might begin with an “E,” a building of glass that leans like a question mark toward the sky, a floor numbered 17½. None of it shakes loose.

You start to walk because moving is the only spell you still believe in.

The sidewalks rearrange themselves like conveyor belts, so you sprint up a fire escape that’s also a piano keyboard; each footfall is a blue G-flat, an urgent D-sharp. At roof level you’re met by a flock of paper airplanes piloted by children made entirely of typos—“helo,” “wrold,” “chld.” They crumple their wings into maps and press one into your palm: a folded square that flickers between subway diagrams, origami cranes, and unread stock prices.

Below, a river scrapes silver foil through the heart of the city. A tram glides over it, suspended from nothing, powered by loud hushes strangers whisper into one another’s ears. You leap—because gravity in dreams is only a clot of belief—and land inside the tram, softly as a dropped thought. Commuters blink at you with ticket-stubs for pupils; in lieu of “Hello” they exhale calendar pages. One slips between your fingers: today’s date circled, stamped VOID.

The tram tapers into a single track that turns into a pay-phone cord. A ringing cracks the air like chalk on a blackboard. You pick up the receiver; it’s so cold it burns. A voice laps the line—watery, underwater, but unmistakably yours. It says only, “Third door that isn’t.” The call ends. Replaced promptly by elevator music that smells faintly of burnt toast.

The tram melts into a subway platform coated in graffiti that keeps correcting itself: the word “LOST” rewritten as “LAST” rewritten as “LATS.” You take the third door that isn’t—there, between beams of light and shadow—because doors in dreams are simply decisions dressed up. On the other side is the lobby of nowhere in particular, checkered in sunspots shaped like spilled milk. Ahead: a receptionist desk where a goldfish in a bowler hat is pounding an antique typewriter, every keystroke a pearl that rolls off the desk and dissolves before it hits the floor.

“I have a meeting,” you blurt, and realize the words came out as soap bubbles spelling themselves in cursive.

The fish peers up with bulging black eyes the size of tiny planets. It points one translucent fin at the rising column to your left: an elevator whose floor indicator counts down from dreams to memories, skips youth altogether, and settles on 17½ with a sigh of hydraulics.

You step inside. The walls are liquid mirrors. They show you walking away—then running toward—then moonwalking sideways, each reflection a rehearsal. As the doors close, they ripple like breathed-on water. A gentle voice, calibrated to the timbre of lullabies, intones: “To arrive at the meeting, forget why you came.”

The elevator climbs with no motor sound, only the soft rustle of pages turning in thick novels no one admits to writing. At 17½ the doors slide open.

You step onto a floor where cubicles melt into sand dunes and the ceiling is a sky with only one very sad cloud. A conference table materializes—oak, bullet-shaped, orbiting slowly. Chairs orbit too, each upholstered in the pattern of your childhood bedsheets. One chair is already occupied by someone wearing the exact expression you wore when you realized you were lost an hour ago. Their tie is a measuring tape; its yellow inches flip like an abacus counting remaining minutes. When they spot you, they raise a hand in greeting. Their palm is a miniature skyline of the city you just threaded through, streetlights winking like conspirators.

There are three empty seats.

A table mic stands upright like a slender lighthouse. You take the chair closest to it, and the moment your weight lands, the sky-cloud thunders—not with rain but with a single calendar tick. Thirty minutes left, though time here is a trapeze act.

You open your mouth. Instead of an apology, the list of all the places you’ve forgotten spills out: goblin markets, paper-flower funerals, airport gates that opened into oceans. None of it suffices. Across the table, the version of you smiles and begins to speak—but writes the words on air instead. The letters drip into a shallow pool that becomes a map of exactly where you are now: the precise intersection of “I should have” and “what if.”

Finally, you ask the question that has been fluttering inside you since the dream began:

“What is the meeting for?”

The other you tilts the measuring-tape tie so the numbers face you. All zeros. Then they point to the miniature skyline in their palm: the tiny city trembles, streetlights rearranging themselves into the luminous shape of a door. It is the first one that *is* rather than isn’t.

You reach out. A breeze—warm, familiar, like breath on a cold windowpane—wraps around your wrist. It smells of toast, slightly burnt, and everything you’ve ever forgotten flashes behind your eyelids, not as words but as a chord struck once, left ringing.

The door swings inward.

There is no corridor, no other room. Only the place you’ve always been: one hour ago, standing on the lip of waking, dialing your own number in your head.

You step through—  
and wake to the soft vibration of your phone on the nightstand.  The screen says 07:00. It shows a calendar reminder titled: “Important meeting –” no address, just the emoji 🗝️.  

You realize you still don’t know where you’re going.  

But the taste of burnt toast lingers on your tongue like a map.
