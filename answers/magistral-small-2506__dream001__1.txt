**dash down the busy streets**, heart pounding. The city is alive with towering skyscrapers, neon signs flickering in languages you don’t recognize, and crowds of people who seem to move in perfect, unfathomable rhythm. You check your pockets—no phone, no notes, just a crumpled train ticket with a strange symbol you’ve never seen before.

A woman in a long, flowing coat brushes past you, her gloved fingers brushing your wrist. She turns, meeting your eyes. "You’re late," she murmurs before vanishing into the crowd.

You realize then: the train ticket isn’t for a train at all. It’s a map.

(What happens next? Do you follow the symbol? Does the city shift around you as you walk? Is the meeting something you never expected?)
