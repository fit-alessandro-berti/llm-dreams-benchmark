you quicken your pace, feeling an urgency to find shelter. The once gentle breeze turns strong, rustling the leaves violently and causing the trees to sway. Dark clouds gather overhead, casting long shadows and dimming the forest’s natural light. The air grows colder, and you can smell the impending rain.

Just as the first few drops begin to fall, you notice a small, moss-covered cottage nestled between two ancient oaks. The cottage has a thatched roof and a small, glowing window. You decide to approach it, hoping to find refuge from the storm.

As you draw closer, you see a faint trail leading to the cottage’s front door. The path is lined with luminescent mushrooms that seem to light the way. You knock on the wooden door, and after a moment, it creaks open on its own.

Inside, the cottage is warm and cozy, with a fire crackling in the hearth. The room is filled with the comforting scent of wood smoke and herbs. You step inside, and the door closes behind you. The storm rages on outside, but inside the cottage, you feel safe and at peace.

You notice a figure sitting in a rocking chair by the fire, their back to you. They turn to face you, revealing a kind, weathered face. The person offers you a warm smile and a cup of steaming tea. As you sit down and sip the tea, the storm outside gradually begins to subside, and a sense of calm envelops you.

The figure tells you stories of the forest and the magical creatures that inhabit it, and you feel a deep connection to this place. As the storm clears, you realize that this dream has given you a new sense of perspective and inner strength. You thank the figure for their hospitality and step back into the now tranquil forest, feeling renewed and at one with nature.
