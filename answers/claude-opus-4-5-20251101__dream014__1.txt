...hesitate for just a moment—something dreamlike about how they appeared all at once, their faces warm but slightly shifting, like reflections in moving water.

The tallest one, a woman with silver hair that seems to catch light from nowhere, hands me a map. But when I look down, it's not streets I see—it's a web of glowing threads, and one pulses gently, leading somewhere that feels like *home*, though I can't picture what that means anymore.

\ knew the way all along,\ and her voice sounds like my grandmother's, then like my own.

We begin walking together through streets that narrow and widen like breathing. Shopfronts display objects from my childhood—a lost toy, a book I'd forgotten I loved. The strangers don't seem strange anymore; I realize I recognize something in each of them. A gesture. A laugh.

The path opens into a courtyard filled with trees bearing paper lanterns instead of fruit. In the center is a door, standing alone, attached to nothing.

\ is as far as we go,\ say in unison, gently.

I turn to thank them, but they've become a murmuration of starlings, spiraling upward into a sky that's somehow both sunset and dawn.

I reach for the handle—

*And wake with my hand outstretched, grasping morning light.*
