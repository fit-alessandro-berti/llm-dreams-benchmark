...grip the wheel with white-knuckled hands, the salt spray stinging your eyes. The *Marauder’s Mercy* groans like a dying beast beneath you—timbers screaming, sails shredded to ribbons. Lightning splits the sky, illuminating the terror on your crew’s faces: young Finn clinging to the mainmast, old Silas shouting unheard warnings over the gale, and Anya, your first mate, her eyes locked on yours, waiting for the word that might save them… or doom them all.

**Then you see it.**  
Not through the rain, but *beneath* it.  

Where the waves should churn with chaotic fury, they instead coil into impossible spirals—glowing faintly azure, as if lit from within. The storm hasn’t just *found* you… it’s *herding* you. Toward a place where the sea itself seems to breathe.  

Your compass spins wildly, then stops dead—needle pointing straight down into the abyss.  

**The choice crashes over you harder than any wave:**  
*Fight the storm?* You’ve done that a hundred times. But this isn’t wind and water anymore. This is something older. Hungrier.  

*Or surrender to it?*  

You meet Anya’s gaze again. She reads your silence. Nods once—sharp, fierce. Trust.  

You slam the wheel hard to port, shouting over the roar: **"Furl what’s left! Seal the hatches! And for the love of all drowned gods—*stop rowing against the current!*"**  

The crew freezes for a heartbeat… then moves as one. Sails collapse. Hatches clang shut. The ship lurches, no longer resisting but *riding* the spiraling swell toward the heart of the glowing maelstrom.  

The sea doesn’t swallow you.  

It *opens*.  

A tunnel of calm forms within the storm—a vortex of liquid sapphire light, walls shimmering with phosphorescent jellyfish and the ghostly outlines of sunken spires. The air stills. Rain hangs suspended like glass beads. Even the wind holds its breath.  

And from the depths ahead, a voice hums—not in your ears, but in your bones:  

***"You remembered the old way, Captain. Few do."***  

Your crew stares, awestruck. Finn whispers, "Where are we?"  

You don’t answer. You’re too busy watching the water ahead ripple… and *part*.  

Revealing a city of coral and pearl, rising from the trench.  

And standing on its highest arch—a figure with eyes like drowned stars, holding out a hand not of flesh, but woven kelp and stormlight.  

The dream isn’t ending.  

It’s just beginning to drown you in wonder.  

*(But you’re the captain. And captains don’t drown. They dive deeper.)*
