... the sky darkens into a swirling tapestry of indigo and silver. The once-quiet trees sway violently, their leaves whispering secrets in a language you almost understand. Just as the first drop of rain falls—a droplet that glimmers like liquid mercury—you notice the ground beneath your feet dissolving into a mosaic of glowing runes. The storm’s thunder isn’t sound but a vibration that hums through your bones, each crash triggering flashes of fragmented memories: a childhood laugh, a forgotten face, a place you’ve never seen. 

Then, the impossible happens: the rain solidifies midair, forming a bridge of crystalline water droplets stretching toward a colossal tree at the forest’s heart. Its trunk pulses with bioluminescent veins, and where the storm’s fury hits its branches, the energy condenses into tiny, floating orbs. You step onto the bridge, and the water holds your weight like glass. As you approach the tree, the orbs coalesce into a single entity—a being made of storm and starlight—that speaks without words: *“Choose a memory to keep, or one to release.”* 

The forest holds its breath.
