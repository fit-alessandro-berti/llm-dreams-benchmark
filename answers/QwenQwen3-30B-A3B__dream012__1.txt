You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you feel the weight of their fear in the creak of the hull and the desperate shouts over the wind. The waves rise like jagged teeth, swallowing the horizon, and lightning splits the sky in violent strokes. Your hands grip the wheel, knuckles white, as the ship lurches sideways.  

Then, a sound—not of wind or water, but a low, resonant hum, as if the storm itself is breathing. The crew falls silent. You turn, and there, rising from the churning blackness, is a figure: a woman made of rain and shadow, her eyes twin whirlpools. She steps onto the deck, her feet leaving no mark, and the storm stills for a heartbeat.  

"You seek direction," she says, her voice the rumble of distant thunder. "But the sea does not answer to maps. It answers to *choice*."  

The crew trembles. You step forward, your voice steady despite the chaos. "What choice?"  

She tilts her head, and the ship shudders. "To fight the storm… or to become it."  

The waves surge, and the sky fractures into a kaleidoscope of colors. The crew screams as the ship tilts, but you feel a strange calm. The woman’s hand brushes your cheek, cold as a winter star. "Choose, Captain," she whispers. "Or be lost to the tide."  

And in that moment, you realize: the storm is not your enemy. It is a mirror. A test. The question is not how to survive, but what you are willing to become.  

The ship dips, the world blurs, and you reach for the wheel—not to steer, but to *let go*.  

The storm howls, and you are flying.
