...realize you need to **remember the name of the wind.**

The air is heavy and smells of damp earth and pulverized chalk. I am standing on ground that feels strangely spongy, dressed in rough, undyed wool that scratches my skin. The sky above is a color I have never seen드 bruised, electric violet, cut through by a sun that is too large and seems to spin slightly too fast.

Around me, the landscape is defined by giants: megalithic stones, slick with prehistoric dew, rising out of a vast marsh where the only sound is the rhythmic *thump-thump* of some unseen creature in the reeds. There are no roads, no structures of metal, only low, dome-shaped dwellings woven from thick, ancient vines.

As I attempt to process this impossible shift, a subtle panic begins to bloom in my chest. I reach instinctively for my pocket등here my phone, my wallet, my keys should be드nd find nothing but the cold, rough knot of the tunic cord.

Then, the realization hits, not as a thought, but as a cold, paralyzing certainty delivered directly into my inner ear:

You are the only one who knows the rhythm.

I turn my head sharply, drawn by a movement near the largest standing stone드 monolith shaped like a petrified hand. A figure stands there: tall, cloaked in woven rushes, their face obscured by shadow. They hold an object aloft: a hollowed gourd that softly whistles a single, melancholic note.

The figure doesn뇺 move or speak, but the weight of their gaze demands compliance. I realize with terrifying clarity that I am not just *in* this era; I am *responsible* for it. The whistling gourd is a timer, and the clock is almost empty.

I need to **find the four keys of basalt before the tide of the forgetting rises above the ridge line.**

My feet begin to move without my command, carrying me toward the muddy bank of the marsh. The four keys are not physical objects, I somehow understand, but four specific sounds that must be spoken into the whistling gourd at dawn. If I fail, the stones will forget their purpose, and the twin, jagged moons above will fracture the sky.

The search is frantic, dream-logic defining my obstacles. I crawl beneath a root system that pulses like a subterranean heart. I trade a piece of my wool garment to a shepherd whose eyes are made of polished amber in exchange for a cryptic rhyme about the 'voice of the weeping clay.'

I find the first key드 deep, resonant hum들n the hollow core of a dead, vine-choked tree, achieved only by pressing my ear against the bark and holding my breath until my vision swam.

The second key is a specific, sharp cry, which I must coax out of a flock of iridescent marsh birds by showing them a reflection of the fast-spinning sun on a pool of undisturbed water. The cry is high and painful, and when I capture it in the gourd, it scalds my hand.

The air is thinning now, the violet sky curdling into a dark slate. The silent, cloaked figures have multiplied, forming a loose, watchful circle around the perimeter of the marsh, never moving, simply observing my desperate quest.

I realize I need to hurry, because the third key is a smell듮he scent of blooming night moss, which grows only on the northern face of the largest standing stone, and which fades the moment it is touched by light. I must grope for it in the deepest shadow, relying on a sense memory I didn't know I possessed.

As I reach the stone, the silent figure from before is waiting. They point, not with their hand, but with the eternal whistle of the gourd. The rhythm is speeding up, growing desperate.

The final key is the name of the wind. Not just *a* name, but its *true* name. It is not a word, but a combination of silence and exhalation. I tilt my head back, feeling the too-swift current of the alien atmosphere across my throat.

I need to **let the wind whisper its name into my mouth.**

I open my lips and inhale deeply, fully, and the wind answers, flooding me with the sound of every gust and storm that has ever passed over this marsh. The knowledge is overwhelming듫ainful and sublime. I exhale, shaping the air into the final, perfect silence.

The four keys are contained. The gourd glows with a furious, internal light.

I turn back toward the silent watchers just as the jagged moons finally touch in the sky. I raise the whistling gourd above my head. The pressure releases. The giant stones sigh, settling deeper into the earth. The rhythm stops.

The figure lowers its gaze. The dawn has arrived드 gentle, golden light replacing the electric violet.

And then, I realize what the fire was for, and what my reward is: not escape, but integration. I have set the rhythm for the next cycle. My purpose is fulfilled.

I look down at my hands. They are no longer my hands. They are rough, stained with peat, and infinitely old. I take my place in the silent circle, picking up a handful of rushes, ready to wait for the next being who will wake up and realize they need to remember the name of the wind.

The dream shifts. I am still here, but centuries have passed in a single breath. The sky is blue again. But the heavy, knowing silence remains.

I sleep, sitting up, waiting for the whistle to begin again.
