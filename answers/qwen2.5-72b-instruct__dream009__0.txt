figure out where and when you are. The landscape is unfamiliar, with rolling hills and forests as far as the eye can see, and the air smells fresh and earthy. There are no paved roads, only dirt paths that wind through the countryside. In the distance, you can see a small village with wooden houses and a thatched-roof church.

You decide to approach the village to gather more information. As you walk, you notice people dressed in simple, medieval-style clothing. They look at you curiously but without hostility. When you reach the village square, you overhear a conversation about the king's recent decree and a festival celebrating the harvest.

One of the villagers, an older man with a kind face, notices your confusion and approaches you. "Greetings, traveler," he says. "You seem lost. Are you new to these parts?"

You explain that you're not from around here and ask for any information that could help you understand your situation better. He introduces himself as Thomas, a local farmer, and offers to show you around and explain some of the customs and events happening in the village.

Thomas tells you that it’s the year 1345, and you are in a small English village. He explains the feudal system, the roles of the villagers, and the importance of the upcoming harvest festival. He also mentions the local lord and the castle on the hill, which serves as the center of authority.

Feeling a bit overwhelmed but grateful for Thomas's kindness, you ask if there's a way to earn your keep while you figure out how to return to your own time. Thomas suggests helping with the harvest, as extra hands are always welcome during this busy season.

You agree, and over the next few days, you work alongside the villagers, learning the skills needed to survive in this era. You form bonds with the community, sharing stories and learning their ways. Despite the challenges, you find a sense of belonging and purpose in this simpler, yet harder, life.

As you continue to live in the village, you keep an eye out for any clues or signs that might help you return to your own time, all the while cherishing the experiences and friendships you've made in this unexpected journey through history.
