You take a deep breath, trying to calm your racing heart. The fluorescent lights flicker overhead, casting an eerie glow on the cluttered desk in front of you. Your boss stands there, arms crossed, their expression unreadable. You glance at the clock on the wall—it’s already ticking faster than it should, as if mocking your predicament.

You open your laptop, but the screen is blank, refusing to cooperate. Panic starts to set in as you realize you don’t even know where to begin. The project details are vague, and the tools you need seem to have vanished into thin air. Your coworkers are nowhere to be seen, leaving you completely alone in this surreal, high-pressure moment.

As you fumble with the keyboard, the room begins to shift. The walls dissolve into a swirling vortex of colors, and you find yourself standing in a vast, empty space. Your boss’s voice echoes from nowhere, saying, “You have until the last star fades to complete it.” You look up and see a sky filled with stars, each one slowly winking out of existence.

You start to work, but every time you make progress, the project resets itself, forcing you to start over. The stars continue to disappear, and the weight of the impossible task feels heavier with each passing second. Just as the last star vanishes, you wake up, heart pounding, relieved it was all just a dream—but the lingering sense of urgency stays with you as you get ready for the real day ahead.
