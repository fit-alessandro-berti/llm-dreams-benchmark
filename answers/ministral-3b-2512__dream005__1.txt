Ah, the dream unfolds like a kaleidoscope of connections—each group a mirror reflecting fragments of who you *could* be, or who you might become with one more glance. Here’s how it might continue:

---

You step into a grand ballroom, the air thick with the scent of aged wine and something electric—like the hum of a thousand conversations just out of reach. The walls are lined with portraits of aristocrats who look *younger* than they should, their smiles too knowing. A group of musicians in velvet jackets plays a slow, melancholic tune, their fingers dancing over strings that seem to hum with secrets. You pause, listening, and realize their music isn’t just sound—it’s a language you’ve heard before, whispered in a crowded subway car or the hum of a train’s engine.

Then, you spot them: *her*. She’s not in the crowd, but in the *space between* them—a woman with a scar running from her temple to her jawline, her fingers tracing the rim of a glass that’s half-empty. She’s laughing at something no one else can hear, her voice a rasp like dry leaves. Around her, a circle of strangers—some nodding in agreement, others leaning in too close, their eyes darting away when she looks their way. One of them is a man in a tailored suit, his tie knotted too tight, his hands clenched into fists. He’s arguing with a woman in a high-neck dress who’s holding a fan like a shield, her gaze fixed on the ceiling as if she’s waiting for something to fall.

You move closer, and the air between you and her feels charged, like the moment before a storm. She turns, and her eyes—dark as ink in storm clouds—lock onto yours. For a second, the room dissolves. The music fades. The people around you blur into indistinct shapes. Then she speaks, her voice a whisper that cuts through the noise:

*"You’re the only one who doesn’t know how to lie."*

A beat. The room reasserts itself. The man in the suit’s jaw tightens. The woman in the fan’s fingers twitch. And then—*she’s gone*, swallowed by the crowd again, leaving only the faintest trace of her scent: something like burnt sugar and old books.

You’re left standing there, your hands trembling. The musicians pause. The crowd parts like water. And there, at the far end of the room, is *him*—the one person you *do* know. He’s laughing with a group of strangers, his voice loud, his eyes bright. He doesn’t see you. Doesn’t *care*.

But as you turn to leave, you notice something strange: the scar on her face isn’t just on her. It’s on *everyone* in the room. Not the same scar, of course—not the same shape or color—but the same *kind*. A mark of something they’ve all done, or been, or *seen*. And the scar on your own face? It’s new. Fresh. And it’s *yours*.

The door at the end of the hall creaks open. The man you know steps out, his smile wide, his eyes gleaming. *"You’re late,"* he says, as if you’ve been waiting for him. *"But not too late."*

The dream ends with the scent of rain on the pavement outside, and the sound of your own breath, shallow and quick, as if you’re holding your breath—waiting for something to happen.
