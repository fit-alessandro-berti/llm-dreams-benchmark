# The Competition

The challenges blur together—impossible logic puzzles where the answers keep changing, a debate where I forget which side I'm arguing for, a skill test in something I've never heard of but somehow know.

But I keep advancing.

In the final round, I'm alone in a vast white room. The judge sits behind a desk, but their face keeps shifting—sometimes it's my old teacher, sometimes a stranger, sometimes me.

\ challenge,\ explain why you want this job.\ my mouth to give my rehearsed answer, but something strange happens: the more I talk, the further away the desk gets. The room stretches. I'm walking toward them but getting nowhere.

Then I stop talking. The room stops stretching.

\,\ myself say, \'t know anymore. When do I get to decide if *this* is what I want? Instead of just competing for it?\iles—and it's just a regular face now, kind of tired, kind of relieved.

\,\.\ did you want this dream to explore?* I can take it in a different direction if you'd like—more unsettling, more hopeful, or somewhere else entirely.
