As the stormy waters rage on my reflection above me, I find myself standing near the entrance of a sunken ship that has been swept away by the currents and the waves have engulfed me once more. The ship's sails appear fragile now, but she moves defiantly as though she knows her actions are bound to their fate down below. Amidst the wreckage, I recall my crew's cries for help from several years prior, the prayers from an old sailor who told them tales of the vessel and its journey across treacherous waters.

I look at my trusty stowaway, a young woman named Lena. She was swept to her death on that fateful night by the fierce tempests and now wears a small sail fashioned from a worn sea harness for me when I docked her early this morning. As she hugs me tightly in the harbor, the smell of saltwater lingers on my breath, mingling with the faint tang of salt water from the ship's broken hull that has accumulated overnight under the bridge as we navigate through the stormy sea.

The captain is a grizzled veteran of many voyages; his weathered face creases with age yet there's an aura about him around me as I make my way alongside him after the storm passes for shore, seeking guidance from those who were once bound together by the trials and tribulations we share on this voyage.
