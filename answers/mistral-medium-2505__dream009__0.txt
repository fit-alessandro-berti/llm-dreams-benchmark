**Dream Continuation:**

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find a way to survive and adapt to this unfamiliar world.**

The air smells different容arthy and untouched by pollution. The buildings, if any, are made of stone or wood, and the people (if there are any) wear clothing that looks handmade. You have no money, no phone, and no idea how to navigate this place.

Your first instinct is to **find shelter and food.** You notice a small village in the distance, but you池e unsure if they値l welcome a stranger. Maybe you値l need to **learn basic skills like hunting, farming, or bartering** to get by.

As you walk, you stumble upon an old, wise-looking traveler who seems to understand your confusion. They offer you guidance, but in exchange, they ask for something you possess用erhaps knowledge from your time, a skill, or even a story.

**What do you do next?**
- **Trust the traveler and follow their advice?**
- **Try to blend in with the villagers, hiding your true origins?**
- **Search for a way back to your own time, even if it means taking risks?**

The dream unfolds as you make your choice, leading you deeper into this strange, timeless world.
