**I continue the dream...**

...find a way to acquire food, shelter, and clothing that fits in with this ancient era. As I emerge from the haze of my unexpected time leap, I notice I'm standing in the middle of a bustling market square. People dressed in tunics, cloaks, and leather aprons hurry about, speaking in a language that sounds like a mix of Old English and Latin. The air is thick with the smells of fresh bread, roasting meats, and woodsmoke.

I take stock of my own attire – I'm still wearing my modern clothes, which consist of a faded t-shirt, ripped jeans, and scuffed sneakers. I stick out like a sore thumb among the crowd. I quickly scan my surroundings, trying to gather my bearings.

To my left, I see a large stone well with a wooden bucket suspended from a rope. Nearby, a group of villagers are gathered around a food stall, where a stout woman is selling what looks like roasted fowl and steaming vegetables. My stomach growls at the savory aromas.

**My immediate goals:**

1. **Blend in**: Find clothing that will help me merge with the locals.
2. **Sustain myself**: Acquire food and water without drawing unnecessary attention.
3. **Gather information**: Learn about this era, the local customs, and potential dangers.

**I approach...**

...the food stall, hoping to use my limited knowledge of Latin to communicate with the vendor. I point to a roasted chicken and try to ask, "_Quantum... um, how much?" The vendor looks at me quizzically, clearly puzzled by my strange attire and accent. A younger boy, likely her son, steps forward and asks in broken Latin, "You... from where? Not from here, yes?"

I hesitate, unsure how much to reveal. Do I:

A) Try to concoct a convincing story about being a traveling merchant from a distant land.
B) Admit to being a "lost traveler" from a far-off place, hoping for sympathy and assistance.
C) Attempt to negotiate for food in exchange for a skill or service I might possess (e.g., basic first aid, knowledge of astronomy).

**Choose my response:**

(Please select one of the options above (A, B, or C), and I'll continue the dream accordingly.)
