…search your pockets for a phone, a notebook, anything that might tell you where you’re supposed to be, but your fingers close around objects that shouldn’t exist.

A small brass key with no teeth, perfectly smooth. A folded photograph of a hallway bathed in green light. A paper ticket that simply reads: “ON TIME.”

The streets around you are wide and strangely quiet, the buildings too tall and too close together, their windows dim like sleeping eyes. Every time you try to focus on a street sign, the letters slide away, rearranging themselves into nonsense. You feel the pressure of the meeting—faces waiting, a name you’re supposed to know, words you’re supposed to say—but the details smear like ink in water.

You pick a direction.

Walking turns fluid, frictionless. One step and you’re at the end of the block; another and you’re suddenly passing a tram that doesn’t move but somehow keeps arriving. People around you all seem to be heading somewhere with brisk, practiced certainty. You try to stop one—a woman with a red scarf—and ask her where the conference center is, or the office, or wherever it is you’re meant to be. She smiles too broadly.

“It’s just ahead,” she says, pointing down a street that wasn’t there a moment ago. “You’re almost late.”

Almost late. The words latch on. You hurry down the new street. It bends slightly, then bends again, then keeps bending until you realize you’ve been walking in a circle that never quite closes. Every time you pass a doorway, you catch a glimpse of that same green-lit hallway from the photograph in your pocket, continuing much farther than the building could possibly extend.

You take the photograph out. The hallway in it is empty, except for a clock at the far end striking the hour. You can actually hear it from the paper: a hollow, echoing chime.

You look up.

There’s a clocktower above the city that you’re certain wasn’t there before. Its face is blank, no hands, just a pale disk. Still, you sense it ticking. The need to be there—wherever “there” is—pulls at your chest.

You decide to shortcut through one of the doors.

When you grasp the handle, it’s warm, like someone just let go of it. You step inside and you’re already halfway down the green-lit hallway, the door behind you gone. The floor is carpeted in a pattern of constellations you almost recognize. Each step makes a soft, delayed sound, as if your footsteps are happening a fraction of a second behind you.

Along the walls hang framed pages: your handwriting, notes you don’t remember writing. Bits of schedules, apologies, drafts of a speech. One page has only three words: “DON’T BE LATE.” The more you read, the less you understand, but the faster your heart races. The hallway stretches.

A man in a dark suit stands at the far end, back turned, perfectly still.

“Is this the way to the meeting?” you call out.

“Yes,” he says, without moving. His voice arrives first, and a second later you see his shoulders jolt, as though catching up. “You’re expected.”

“Where is it?” you ask.

He raises an arm and points at a door that wasn’t there a blink ago. On it hangs a plaque already engraved with your name.

“You’re right on time,” he says, and when he finally turns toward you, his face is subtly, impossibly wrong—features placed just a few millimeters off, as if someone reconstructed him from vague memory.

Your hand is on the doorknob before you realize you never told anyone your name.

Inside, a large room opens—a conference table stretching out far beyond what the building’s floorplan could hold. Every chair is occupied by a version of you: older, younger, tired, hopeful, dressed for different lives you didn’t live. They all lift their heads as you enter, and for a moment the only sound is the slow, synchronized inhale of every you in the room.

At the far end sits a single empty chair, facing them.

“That’s yours,” they say together.

You walk to it because there’s nothing else you can imagine doing. As you sit, the brass key appears on the table in front of you. Now it has teeth—complicated, intricate. The blank clock face outside fills the windows, leaning in close like a moon.

A folder is placed before you. It’s already open, already read, already remembered.

“This is the important meeting,” says the you closest on your right. “We’re here to decide which memory will become your reason, and which ones we will erase so you can keep moving.”

“Meeting called to order,” says another you. “You’re late.”

“I’m—”

But the clock has no hands, so there is no proof.

The man in the dark suit stands behind you now, where you can’t quite turn enough to see. He whispers, a fraction early, his voice arriving just ahead of itself:

“Don’t worry. It always happens this way. Just sign.”

A pen appears in your hand.

You look down at the page. The words won’t stay still, but one line is clear: “I agree to forget why I came.”

Everyone waits. All those yous, holding their breath, hoping and fearing the same thing.

You sign.

When the pen lifts, the green light flickers off like a switch. The room vanishes around you.

You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, realizing you have an important meeting in an hour, but no idea where it is.

You start to search your pockets.
