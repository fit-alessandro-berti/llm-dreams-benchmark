wander through the labyrinthine streets, the towering buildings casting long shadows that twist and shift like living things. The air hums with a strange energy, a mix of distant voices and mechanical whirs, as if the city itself is alive. You glance at your wrist, but instead of a watch, there's a glowing tattoo of a clock counting down—fifty-seven minutes now. Panic creeps in, but you notice a figure ahead, cloaked in shimmering fabric that reflects the neon lights around you. They turn, and their face is obscured by a mask of polished metal, featureless yet somehow watching you.
“Lost, are we?” the figure says, their voice a melodic echo that seems to come from everywhere. You nod, explaining the meeting, and they tilt their head as if considering something. “The place you seek isn’t on any map,” they say, extending a hand. In their palm, a small, iridescent orb pulses faintly. “Swallow this, and you’ll see.”
You hesitate, the clock tattoo ticking down to fifty-five minutes. With little choice, you take the orb and swallow it. A rush of cold floods your veins, and suddenly the city transforms—streets rearrange themselves into glowing paths, signs flicker into symbols you instinctively understand, and a golden thread appears, hovering in the air, leading you forward. You follow it, weaving through crowds of faceless people and past buildings that ripple like water. The thread pulls you into a narrow alley, where a door materializes, unmarked but radiating warmth.
You push it open and step into a room bathed in soft light. A table sits in the center, surrounded by figures you can’t quite make out—shadowy, yet familiar. The clock on your wrist chimes; you’ve made it with moments to spare. One of the figures rises, their voice calm and clear: “We’ve been waiting. Shall we begin?” And as you sit, the dream shifts, the city fading into a hum of possibility, leaving you with the sense that whatever happens next is entirely up to you.
