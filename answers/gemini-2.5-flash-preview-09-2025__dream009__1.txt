...realize I need to **learn how to speak, read, and understand the world all over again, or I will not survive the day.**

My awakening was violent. It wasn't the slow crawl from sleep, but a sudden jolt onto a hard, dirt floor that smelled overwhelmingly of wet wool, woodsmoke, and unwashed bodies. I was lying in a small, windowless structure, perhaps a shed or a very crude home.

I pushed myself up, my modern clothing—a simple t-shirt and jeans—feeling absurdly thin and bright against the gloom. Outside, the light was weak, filtered through heavy grey clouds. I stumbled out, blinking.

The village was a riot of noise and smells. Hogs rooted in the mud paths. The buildings were rough timber frames packed with wattle and daub, their roofs heavy with mossy thatch. Everyone was dressed in coarse, undyed linen and homespun wool. They wore simple leather boots and carried crude iron tools. This wasn't a historical reenactment. This was harsh, brutal reality. The air hummed with the sound of axes striking wood and the sharp, metallic clang of a distant blacksmith.

Panic began to rise, but instinct took over. I needed water. I needed to understand where I was.

I walked toward a group of people clustered around a well—a woman drawing water, an older man sharpening a knife on a stone, and a child clutching a wooden doll. I tried to keep my breathing even, forcing myself to look non-threatening.

"Excuse me," I said, my voice sounding impossibly loud and brittle in the dense air. "Can anyone tell me what year this is? Or perhaps," I tried, desperately, "where the nearest city is?"

The man stopped sharpening his knife. The child stared at my sneakers with wide, dark eyes. The woman at the well slowly turned, her face weathered and stern.

They didn't look confused by my question. They looked confused by my *sound*.

The old man frowned deeply, then spoke, a guttural stream of syllables that tasted like stones and iron. It wasn't just another language; it was a soundscape I had never encountered. It had sharp vowels and rough consonants, a rhythm that was completely alien to any language I’d ever heard on Earth—not Latin, not Greek, not any form of modern or ancient European tongue I could place.

I shook my head, my heart hammering against my ribs. "I don't understand. Do you speak English? French? Spanish?"

The man spat onto the ground, clearly agitated. He pointed a rigid finger at my chest, then launched into another phrase—this time louder, the tone accusatory and laced with suspicion. His eyes raked over my unfamiliar clothing, my clean face, my soft hands.

The realization struck me with the force of a physical blow, worse than the realization that I was in the past:

I was not just temporally lost, I was linguistically and socially invisible. In this era, my clothes were not merely different—they were evidence of witchcraft or foreign espionage. My speech was not just foreign—it was meaningless noise.

I had no currency, no trade skills that meant anything (what good is coding when there are no computers?), and no way to ask for help, food, or shelter. To them, I was a silent, ill-dressed threat, or perhaps a mute who had wandered in from the wilderness.

I saw the woman nervously reach for a thick piece of firewood near the well. I saw the man heft the knife he had just sharpened. They were preparing to defend their meager lives against this strange, incomprehensible intruder.

I needed to disappear immediately, find a place to hide, and somehow, impossibly, learn to mimic their sounds and understand their customs before the sun set. If I failed, I would be found guilty of being *wrong*, and in this harsh, unfamiliar era, that was a capital offense.

I needed to learn their language, and fast. I turned and fled the village path, disappearing into the dense, silent forest, my heart cold with the knowledge that I was the most isolated person in the history of time.
