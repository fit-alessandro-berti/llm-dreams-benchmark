written in a language you don't understand. Panic sets in as you frantically flip through the pages, hoping to find something familiar. Suddenly, you realize that the words are shifting and morphing, as if they’re alive. The letters swirl and rearrange themselves into a single sentence: *"The answer is within you."*  

You close your eyes, take a deep breath, and when you open them again, the exam paper is blank except for a single question: *"What are you truly passionate about?"*  

You pause, your heart racing, and begin to write. As your pen moves across the page, the room around you dissolves. You find yourself standing in a vibrant, surreal landscape—the embodiment of your dreams and aspirations. The exam was never about the questions on the paper. It was about trusting yourself and embracing the path that feels right.  

You wake up with a sense of clarity, knowing that your future isn’t determined by a test, but by the choices you make and the passion you follow.
