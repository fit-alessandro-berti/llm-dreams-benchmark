As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and unexpected twists. The first round is a high-pressure coding marathon, where you must debug a complex algorithm under a ticking clock. The room hums with the sound of keyboards, and your fingers fly across yours, weaving logic into flawless execution.  

Next, you're thrust into a collaborative challenge—designing an AI system with strangers who soon become allies. Ideas spark like fireworks as you debate architectures, optimize neural networks, and refine user experiences. The judges watch intently, their expressions unreadable.  

The final round is surreal: you stand on a stage, bathed in a spotlight, answering philosophical questions about technology’s role in humanity. The audience fades into shadows as you speak, your voice steady, your vision clear.  

Then—silence. The head judge steps forward, holding an envelope. Your heart pounds. As the paper tears open, you wake up, the dream slipping away… but the fire it ignited in you remains.  

What happens next in *your* dream?
