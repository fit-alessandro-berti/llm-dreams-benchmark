You start to panic—your wristwatch has stopped, its hands frozen at 3:17, and your phone is just a smooth, cold stone in your pocket, no screen, no signal. The sky above is a deep violet, streaked with slow-moving auroras that hum faintly, like distant violins. The buildings aren’t made of steel or brick, but of stacked books, their spines glowing with names you almost recognize—*The Memory of Rain*, *How to Forget a Name*, *The Last Laugh of Clocks*.

People walk past you, silent, their faces blurred as if seen through frosted glass. One of them floats slightly above the cobblestones—each step leaving behind a tiny flower that dissolves into smoke. You try to ask for directions, but your voice comes out as a melody, a lullaby in a language you’ve never learned but somehow know by heart.

Then you remember: your meeting is with the Keeper of Lost Minutes.

You follow the scent of burned cinnamon and old ink down a spiraling alleyway where shadows peel off the walls and whisper your childhood secrets back to you. A bridge made of piano keys stretches over a river of liquid twilight. On the other side, a door shaped like an open book waits. No handle. Just a single sentence carved into the wood, glowing amber:

*“You were always late because you were never truly here.”*

You push the door open.

Inside, the room is infinite, lined with floating hourglasses, each containing a different version of you—some crying, some laughing, some sleeping, one holding a keys to a door you don’t remember locking.

At the center sits a figure made of shifting paper, their face a collage of your mother’s smile, your best friend’s frown, and your own reflection from five years ago.

“You’re late,” they say—not harshly, but sadly.

“I know,” you whisper. “I think… I’ve been late my whole life.”

They smile. “Then again, maybe you arrived exactly on time.”

The hourglasses begin to glow—and then, one by one, they shatter.

The city dissolves into feathers.  
The sky becomes a heartbeat.  
And you wake up…  

…just in time.

Your alarm clock reads 7:59.

But on your nightstand, beside your phone—frozen at 3:17—is a single, perfect paper flower, still faintly warm.

And the scent of cinnamon lingers.

You don’t remember dreaming.  
But something inside you knows—you weren’t late.  
You were simply on time…  
for a different kind of moment.
