You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to storm out of the room to cool off. But as you turn to leave, the door doesn't lead to the hallway—instead, it opens into a vast, swirling vortex of colors, like a living painting come to life. Your friend calls after you, their voice echoing strangely, but you step through anyway, driven by that stubborn mix of anger and curiosity that only dreams can amplify.

Suddenly, you're falling—no, floating—through a sky filled with floating islands, each one a fragment of your shared memories. There's the island where you first met as kids, building sandcastles that now tower like ancient ruins; another where you laughed over late-night secrets, but now it's overgrown with thorny vines representing all the unspoken resentments. Your friend appears beside you, not walking but gliding on wings made of old photographs, their face shifting between expressions of fury and forgiveness.

"What are we even fighting about?" you shout over the wind, and they reply, "The future—our paths diverging like these islands!" But as you argue mid-air, the islands begin to collide, merging into one massive landmass. You land together on a beach of shimmering glass, where the argument dissolves into laughter because, in this dream logic, the "important thing" turns out to be absurd: whether pineapple belongs on pizza, symbolizing all your deeper fears of growing apart.

Just as you hug it out, the ground shakes, and you realize the island is actually a giant turtle swimming through the stars. It dives into an ocean of clouds, and you wake up gasping, tangled in your bedsheets, with a lingering sense of reconciliation—and a sudden craving for pizza. Was it all just a dream, or a message from your subconscious? You text your friend first thing in the morning, just to check.
