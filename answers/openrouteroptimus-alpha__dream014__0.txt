smile with relief, letting their warmth wash over you. The city’s noise softens as you follow them, their laughter weaving through the streets like music. Neon lights blur into vibrant trails, and each building seems less imposing with your new companions beside you. As you walk, one of them hands you a small paper map—when you unfold it, you see not streets, but a tapestry painted with stars and rivers, as if the whole city has transformed into a fantastical landscape.

Your footfalls become lighter. Guided by the group and the magically shifting map, you pass a glowing fountain where silver fish leap through the air and a rooftop garden blooming with impossible flowers. The strangers point out secret doors and hidden alleys you never noticed before, and the city now feels like an unfolding story just for you.

Eventually, you reach a golden archway. The strangers smile, their faces familiar now—maybe even reminiscent of old friends or fragments of memory—and wave as you step through. On the other side, the city is gone, and you find yourself in a quiet, sunlit park. Birds sing, and your sense of loneliness lifts. You realize, even as the dream fades, that sometimes all it takes to find your way is to accept a little kindness and let yourself be led into the unknown.
