You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you—  

—notice the walls of the office are made of shifting sand, and your computer screen flickers with a message: **"Project: Build a bridge between the stars. Deadline: 3 minutes."** Your boss, usually a stern man in a suit, now has the face of a clock with melting gears, his voice a chorus of overlapping whispers: *"You’ve always been good at impossible things. Don’t let me down."*  

You scramble to open your desk drawer, but inside are not pens or files, but live snakes coiled around sticky notes scrawled with equations. Your coffee mug is half-full of liquid that glows faintly blue, and when you sip it, you taste static. The clock on the wall ticks backward, and your colleagues—now faceless silhouettes—murmur in a language that sounds like your childhood lullaby.  

You try to type, but your keyboard spits out confetti. The project requirements scroll endlessly: *"The bridge must hold the weight of a supernova, be invisible to light, and hum the melody of your first heartbreak."* Your hands move on their own, clicking and dragging, as if possessed by a thousand unseen fingers.  

Suddenly, the room dissolves into a vast desert under a violet sky. Your boss stands atop a dune, waving a hourglass filled with smoke. You realize the "project" is your own body—your bones are now scaffolding, your blood a glowing liquid metal. You scream, but your voice is a radio static.  

Then, just as the hourglass empties, you wake up in your bed, drenched in sweat, your hands stained with ink that fades when you touch it. On your desk, a single post-it note reads: **"You did it. Now remember."**  

But when you look up, the clock on your wall reads 3:00 AM—and your computer screen is dark.
