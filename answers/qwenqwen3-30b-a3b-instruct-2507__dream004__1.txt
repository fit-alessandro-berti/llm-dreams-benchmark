...a blank canvas and a single, unassuming paintbrush lying on the ground beside it. The brush glows faintly, its bristles shimmering like liquid mercury. You pick it up—warm, alive, humming with potential.

As soon as your fingers close around the handle, the world *sighs*. The ever-shifting colors around you *pause*, then begin to pulse rhythmically. The air tastes like vanilla and forgotten memories. You raise the brush toward the canvas.

But the canvas doesn’t want to be painted.

It *whispers*.

*"Don’t draw me. Don’t fill me. I’m not empty. I’m waiting for you to remember."*

Your hand trembles. The brush stirs in your grip, not by your will, but by its own. It dips—not into paint, but into the air itself. And suddenly, a stream of pure, liquid light spills from its tip, not onto the canvas, but *into you*. You gasp—your chest floods with starlight, and your mind flashes with images: a lullaby sung in a language you’ve never heard, a child burying a coin beneath a willow tree, the first time you ever laughed without reason.

The canvas shivers. Then, slowly, it begins to *breathe*. Not flat, but with a soft rise and fall, like a sleeping heart. And on its surface, shapes form—not painted, but *grown*: a spiral of blue smoke, a flock of birds made of shadow, a face that looks just like your own but from another lifetime. Tears well in your eyes.

The brush vanishes. Your fingers are empty. The world continues its kaleidoscopic dance—but now, everything feels *darker*, richer, more real.

You realize: you weren’t supposed to paint the canvas.

You were supposed to remember it.

And you have.
