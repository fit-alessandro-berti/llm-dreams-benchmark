...panic, then force yourself to breathe. The air tastes of ozone and distant rain. Your hand instinctively goes to your jacket pocket, and your fingers brush against something cool and smooth: a single, polished river stone you don’t remember putting there.

As you pull it out, the city around you shimmers. The nameless streets suddenly gleam with faint, silvery lines beneath the pavement, like veins of quicksilver. They pulse softly, leading away from you in every direction.

A calm, resonant voice, not your own but coming from within your own mind, says, *“The stone remembers the path. Let it fall.”*

Without understanding why, you kneel and place the stone on the cobblestones. It doesn’t rest. It begins to roll, picking up speed, following one of the silver threads. You have no choice but to run after it, your footsteps echoing in the suddenly silent canyons of the skyscrapers.

The stone leads you through a market where the scents are colors, and the merchants watch you with knowing, amber eyes. It clatters down a flight of steps into a subway station, but the train that waits is silent, its cars empty and lit by a soft, blue glow. The doors sigh open as you approach.

You step inside, the stone resting now at your feet. As the train moves without sound or driver, you look at the map above the doors. There is only one stop, marked by a symbol that shifts as you look at it: sometimes an eye, sometimes a clock, sometimes a simple star.

You pick up the stone. It’s warm now. The train decelerates, and the doors open onto a sun-drenched plaza. In the center is a fountain, and sitting at its edge is the person you’re meant to meet: it’s you, older, calmer, smiling.

“You’re on time,” your other self says. “We have much to discuss. The city is waiting for you to remember it.”

And as you sit, you realize the meeting isn’t about an appointment you forgot. It’s about a future you haven’t yet chosen. The dream deepens, and the real conversation begins.
