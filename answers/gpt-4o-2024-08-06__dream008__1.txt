begin to feel a wave of anxiety wash over you. The office around you starts to morph and change; the walls ripple like water, and your desk begins to float gently away. Your colleagues are suddenly wearing costumes from a circus, balancing precariously on high wires strung across the ceiling. Despite the surreal scene, your boss remains focused, holding a large clock with hands spinning uncontrollably.

You sit at your floating desk, unsure of how to begin this impossible task. As you tap on your keyboard, the keys transform into tiny birds that flap away, leaving you unable to type. Frustrated, you reach for a stack of papers, but as you touch them, they dissolve into sand and slip through your fingers.

Out of the corner of your eye, you notice a door that wasn’t there before. It’s slightly ajar, glowing with a soft, inviting light. Instinctively, you know that entering the door might lead to a solution or an escape. Hesitant but driven by curiosity, you stand up, and the desk drifts away completely.

Walking across the office, which now feels like walking on clouds, you approach the glowing door. Behind you, the circus music intensifies, and your boss gives you a knowing nod, as if granting permission or acknowledging your need to explore.

With a deep breath, you push the door open and step through. On the other side, you find a serene garden bathed in the gentle light of a sunset. Flowers with vivid, impossible colors bend towards you, whispering secrets of calm and creativity. In the center of the garden is a clear pond, reflecting the sky above and below.

You kneel by the water and see your reflection become clearer, more focused. In the reflection, you notice that you hold a scroll in your hand with the perfect solution to your impossible project. The anxiety lifts as you commit the image to memory.

Feeling a sense of peace and purpose, you turn back to the office, now transformed from a place of chaos to one of calm. The circus performers applaud as you return to your desk, no longer floating, ready to begin your work with newfound confidence and clarity.
