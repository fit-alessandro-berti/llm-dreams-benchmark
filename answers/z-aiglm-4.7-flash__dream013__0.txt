...**find that the stone paths are disappearing, replaced by floating geometric shapes that rotate in silent, gravity-defying orbits.**

The air feels thick here, tasting faintly of ozone and old dust. Ahead, the corridors converge into a colossal hall where the walls are no longer solid, but are made of thousands of vibrating strings that hum a dissonant chord. To move forward, you cannot walk; you must solve the silence. You realize you aren't looking for a key, but for a rhythm that fits this impossible geometry. As you tap a complex sequence of beats against the pulsating wall, the vibrations shift from dissonance to a perfect C Major chord, and the floor beneath you shatters into stardust, revealing the exit.
