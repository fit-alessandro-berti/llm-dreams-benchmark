...take a deep breath and step away. Not out of defeat, but out of necessity.  The air crackled with tension, the words unspoken but heavy in the silence that followed my last outburst.  My friend's face, usually so full of warmth and laughter, was tight with barely contained anger.

I knew that continuing this way would only lead to more pain and possibly irreparable damage to our bond.  So, I said, my voice unusually calm amidst the storm raging within, "I need some space.  Let's talk about this when we've both had time to cool down."

We stood there for a moment, the unspoken question hanging in the air: what if this wasn't just a disagreement that could be resolved? Would this be the thing that shattered our friendship? 

I didn't have the answer, and the fear, cold and prickly, coiled in my stomach. 

But before I could dwell on it, I felt a pull, a magnetic hum that began in my chest and spread outwards.  The room around us began to shimmer, the furniture morphing into swirling, iridescent shapes, the familiar walls dissolving into a vibrant sky.  We were no longer in the kitchen of my apartment, but floating above a expansive, lavender field, the stars twinkling like scattered diamonds.

My friend's surprise mirrored my own, her anger fading as she looked around at the fantastical scene.  A sense of peace, surreal and unexpected, settled over us.  

We began to talk then, not as adversaries but as companions on an unexpected journey.  We spoke of our hurt, our fears, and our hopes for our friendship.   The dream logic guided us, weaving our conversation into the fabric of the dream itself - our words blooming into vibrant flowers that danced in the starlight, our frustrations dissolving into sparkling streams that flowed beneath our feet.

As the dream faded, I was aware that the argument hadn't gone away, the issues were still there.  But somewhere in the surreal landscape of the lavender fields, we had rediscovered a space for understanding, a foundation of love that could help us navigate the coming storm.  We landed back in my kitchen, the argument seemingly distant and smaller, the tension replaced with a fragile hope.


The dream left me with a knowing smile, asking me to carry that hope into reality.
