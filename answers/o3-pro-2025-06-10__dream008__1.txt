…feel the heat of a dozen fluorescent tubes buzzing overhead. As the hum swells it becomes a single, urgent note, like a kettle about to whistle. Your boss—who usually wears plain glasses—now sports frames shaped exactly like hour-glasses, each side dripping sand faster than seems possible. He taps his watch. Every tap sounds like a judge’s gavel.

You slide into your chair and open the project folder. Instead of documents, a tiny brass key lies inside. The moment you lift it, the office lights dim, cubicle walls soften, and the entire floor tilts as though the building has become a giant pinball machine. Desks glide past, papers float upward like jellyfish, yet no one else reacts. Colleagues type calmly while rotating in slow circles, still tethered to their chairs.

A blinking cursor appears in mid-air, suspended like a neon firefly. You reach out instinctively and it sticks to your fingertip. Wherever you point, typewritten paragraphs spool out, forming bridges of text that arc over filing cabinets. You realize writing alone won’t finish this project in time; you need something faster.

Then you notice the office printer rumbling like an engine. It splits open, revealing a spiral staircase inked onto the inside panels. You descend and find yourself in a cavernous archive lit by desk-lamps that look like floating origami cranes. Shelves stretch to the clouds, labeled “Ideas Not Yet Thought.” You insert the brass key into a tiny lock on the nearest shelf. It swings open, releasing a flurry of glowing sticky notes. Each one contains a perfectly worded solution to a task you hadn’t even known was required.

While the notes whirl around you, your phone buzzes. The screen shows a countdown at five minutes—but the digits are melting, Salvador-Dalí style. You suddenly understand: in this dream logic, an “impossible deadline” is just an illusion of scale. The faster the clock drips, the slower real time actually moves. You snap your fingers, and the sticky notes arrange themselves into a neat stack, bound by a ribbon of light.

Back upstairs, you hand the stack to your boss. The sand in his glasses freezes mid-fall. He raises an eyebrow, tearing open the ribbon. As he reads, the office expands outward, walls folding like paper to reveal a panorama of sunrise over city rooftops. The ceiling dissolves into a sky the color of first light.

Your boss nods, but instead of saying “Good job,” he places a feather in your palm. “This is your next deadline,” he whispers. Before you can ask what that means, the feather lifts you gently off the floor, and the office recedes until it’s nothing but a cube-shaped cloud.

Up here, deadlines look tiny—just twinkles on the horizon. You realize you’re weightless, floating in possibility. With a calm breath you turn the feather into a quill, ready to rewrite the dream—and any impossible deadline that follows.
