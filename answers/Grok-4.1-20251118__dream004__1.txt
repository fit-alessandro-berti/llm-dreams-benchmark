…a single, shimmering brush made of liquid starlight hovering just above it.

You reach out instinctively. The moment your fingers close around the handle, the canvas ripples like water and pulls you in.

Suddenly you’re standing inside the painting itself. The blankness around you is alive, breathing, waiting. Every heartbeat you take sends a pulse of color across the void (first a soft indigo, then a violent crimson, then a gold so bright it sings). The colors don’t just appear; they remember. They remember every dream you’ve ever had, every secret you’ve never told anyone, every shade of feeling you buried years ago.

You lift the brush.

The first stroke you make is accidental, a nervous flick of the wrist. It births an impossible tree whose leaves are tiny mirrors reflecting futures that haven’t happened yet. In one leaf you see yourself waking up tomorrow; in another you see yourself never waking up at all. Both feel equally real.

You keep painting.

Mountains grow upside-down from the sky, their peaks dripping molten sunset into rivers of liquid clockwork. Fish made of forgotten phone numbers swim upstream. A moon with your childhood face drifts overhead, whispering apologies in a language that tastes like rain on hot pavement.

The more you paint, the less control you have. The canvas starts painting you back. Your skin begins to shift (now turquoise grief, now ultraviolet joy), your shadow detaches and wanders off to have adventures without you. You try to step away, but the ground has become wet paint and your feet sink deeper, deliciously deeper.

Somewhere in the distance, the blank edge of the canvas is approaching like a tidal wave of pure possibility. If it reaches you, everything you’ve made (and everything you are) will be erased and reborn as something new.

You could drop the brush and run.

Or you could paint faster.

You smile, dip the starlight brush into the color of your own pulse, and charge straight toward the coming white.

What do you paint in the final second before the nothing swallows everything?
