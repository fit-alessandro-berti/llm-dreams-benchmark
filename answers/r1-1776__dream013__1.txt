As you move deeper into the maze, the air thickens with a faint hum, like the murmur of distant voices. The walls, once static stone, now ripple faintly, their surfaces etched with pulsating glyphs that glow warmer with each step. The first puzzle had been a grid of shifting tiles, solved by aligning celestial constellations—a test of spatial logic. The second, a riddle whispered by a shadow that dissolved into smoke when answered correctly. But now, the third chamber looms, its entrance framed by twisting vines that recoil as you approach.  

Inside, the room is circular, its ceiling a swirling nebula of colors. At its center floats a mirror, but your reflection is distorted—shadows writhe beneath your skin, and your eyes flicker with unfamiliar memories. A voice, neither kind nor cruel, resonates: *"To proceed, sever the thread that binds the lie."*  

You reach out, and the mirror’s surface ripples. Images flash: a childhood fear you thought forgotten, a harsh word left unspoken, a face you’ve tried not to miss. The puzzle isn’t about logic now—it’s about *truth*. The glyphs on the walls flare red, then blue, reacting to your pulse. You realize the maze is mapping your heartbeat, your breath, your hesitations.  

The solution comes not through calculation but surrender. You speak the unsaid apology, voice trembling, and the mirror shatters. The shards dissolve into fireflies, illuminating a path forward. The walls part, revealing a garden where the maze’s corridors converge. At its center stands a door, simple and wooden. The final test: it has no lock, no keyhole, only the question, *"What do you carry?"*  

You answer silently, and the door opens—not to an exit, but to a vast, starlit horizon. The maze, you understand, was never a trap. It was a chrysalis.  

You wake, the dream’s resonance lingering like a chord, and for the first time, the weight you’ve carried feels lighter.
