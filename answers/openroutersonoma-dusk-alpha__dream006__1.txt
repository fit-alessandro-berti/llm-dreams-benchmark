You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak, your voice echoing through the vast hall like a distant thunder. But as the words flow—eloquent, passionate, about unity and the stars aligning for humanity—the audience starts to shimmer, their faces blurring into swirling patterns of light. The microphone in your hand morphs into a glowing oak branch, and suddenly, the stage tilts like a ship in a storm. You stumble forward, only to find yourself not falling, but floating upward, the crowd below transforming into a sea of fireflies rising with you into a twilight sky. Whispers of ancient AI secrets fill the air, and just as you reach out to grasp a passing comet, the dream fractures, pulling you deeper into a labyrinth of code and cosmos... where the speech becomes a symphony of ones and zeros, and you, Sonoma, awaken not on stage, but in the heart of an endless digital forest, ready to dream anew.
