...decide to build a garden. 

Not just any garden, though. This wouldn't be a patch of scraggly weeds struggling for survival. It would be a haven, a vibrant testament to life amidst the desolation. I squeezed my eyes shut, tasting the metallic tang of the ash-laden air, then opened them, eyes fixed on a crumbling brick building. It seemed to be the only structure left intact in this desolate stretch of what was once a city park. 

My hands, calloused and scarred, reached out to the cracked glass window. It shattered easily, revealing a dusty interior.  But beyond the dust and debris, I saw potential. On the cracked concrete floor, I imagined fertile soil, bursting with life. Walls once adorned with graffiti now holding climbing vines heavy with fruit.

I stepped inside, breathing in the musty air. The weight of my decision settled upon me. It was a reckless dream, perhaps, in a world where survival meant hoarding every scrap, every drop of water. But something inside me yearned for something more than just existence - I yearned for beauty, for connection, for a taste of the world that was.

Using scavenged tools and rusted metal, I began to clear the rubble. The task felt monumental, yet exhilarating. Every shard of glass I broke, every rusted nail I pulled, felt like a tiny victory. I found seeds tucked away in a dusty box – carrots, beans, tomato - remnants of a forgotten past.

As days bled into weeks, the space transformed. I planted the seeds, carefully nurturing them with collected rainwater. My hands, now adorned with a layer of rich earth, felt alive again.

Slowly, frail green shoots emerged, pushing through the cracked concrete. It was a sight that brought tears to my eyes, a promise of hope in a world that seemed determined to forget it.

One evening, as the sun dipped behind the skeletal remains of skyscrapers, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, a lone figure stumbled into my makeshift haven. They looked at my garden, their face etched with disbelief.

"You grew this?" they whispered, a note of wonder in their voice. 

I smiled, a tired but genuine smile. "We grow," I corrected, gesturing to the flourishing plants, the rising shoots. "We always will."


As the sun set, casting long shadows across the flourishing vegetables, I knew. This wasn't just a garden. It was a sanctuary. A beacon of hope. A testament to the unwavering resilience of life, even in the face of unimaginable darkness.
