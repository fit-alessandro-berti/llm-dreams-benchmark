You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, you notice the walls are not just stone but shimmer with faint, shifting patterns that seem to pulse in rhythm with your heartbeat. The air is thick with the scent of aged parchment and burning candle wax, and the faint hum of a distant, unseen orchestra fills the silence between your steps.  

The first puzzle is a labyrinth of mirrors, each reflecting a different version of yourself—some smiling, some weeping, some staring back with hollow eyes. You must navigate the mirrors without stepping on the glowing red lines that twist between them, which seem to shift as you watch. When you finally reach the center, a single door opens, revealing a room carved into the floor like a giant grid. The walls are covered in equations, and in the middle stands a pedestal with a single, glowing crystal. To proceed, you must solve the equation etched into the floor: *The sum of your fears, multiplied by the time you’ve hesitated, divided by the number of times you’ve lied to yourself.* You realize the answer lies not in numbers but in your own memories—each fear and hesitation a piece of your past. You solve it, and the crystal shimmers, revealing a path forward.  

Deeper in the maze, the puzzles become stranger. You encounter a door with no handle, its surface inscribed with a riddle: *I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?* You answer *an echo*, but the door remains closed. After hours of searching, you realize the riddle is a metaphor: the answer lies in the *echoes* of your own thoughts, and you must repeat the riddle aloud, not to the door, but to yourself. When you do, the door creaks open, revealing a corridor lined with floating books that flicker between languages.  

As you proceed, the maze begins to *change*. The walls shift to form new labyrinths, and the ground beneath you warps, bending gravity into impossible angles. You solve a puzzle involving a pendulum that only swings when you remember a forgotten childhood memory, then another that requires you to reverse the order of a sequence of shadows cast by the walls. Each solution feels like peeling back a layer of your own mind, and you begin to wonder if the maze is not just testing you, but *reflecting* you.  

Finally, you reach a chamber where the walls are infinite, stretching into a void that seems to pulse with a life of its own. In the center stands a figure—a mirror image of yourself, but with eyes that hold the memories of every puzzle you’ve solved. The figure speaks in a voice that is both yours and not yours: *“You are the maze. You are the puzzle. You are the answer. But to escape, you must choose: will you remember the path you’ve taken, or will you forget it entirely?”*  

You stare into its eyes, and for a moment, the room dissolves. When you open your eyes, you are back in your bedroom, the glow of your phone screen casting long shadows. But as you reach for it, you notice the walls are still lined with the same shifting patterns, and the faint hum of the orchestra is still there. You realize you’re dreaming—and the maze is waiting, endless and ever-changing, for you to return.
