In the dream, I can feel the tension thick in the air between us. Our voices have been rising, and I can see how much this matters to both of us. After a moment of heated exchange, I decide to take a deep breath and suggest we both step back for a moment.

I say, "Look, we both care deeply about this, which is why we're both so passionate. But I can see this isn't getting us anywhere productive." I pause, studying my friend's face.

"What if we both try to summarize what we think the other person's main concerns are, before we keep arguing? I want to make sure I'm actually hearing what matters to you."

In the dream, there's something almost cinematic about the way the lighting changes as we both settle slightly, the anger giving way to a more focused intensity. My friend nods slowly, and we begin to actually listen to each other.

Would you like to continue the dream from here? How do you think this conversation plays out?
