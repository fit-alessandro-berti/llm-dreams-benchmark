find a way to fit in and survive in this unfamiliar time. You notice that everyone around you is dressed in period-appropriate clothing, so you quickly gather some materials and fashion a simple outfit for yourself to blend in. As you walk through the bustling streets, you hear people speaking in a language you don't understand. You realize that learning the language is crucial for your survival, so you make it your top priority. You find a local market and offer to help the vendors in exchange for lessons in their language. As you work and learn, you begin to understand the customs and culture of this new era. You also notice that there are no banks or modern currency, so you start bartering goods and services to acquire what you need. Slowly but surely, you adapt to this new way of life, making friends and even finding a purpose in this strange but fascinating world.
