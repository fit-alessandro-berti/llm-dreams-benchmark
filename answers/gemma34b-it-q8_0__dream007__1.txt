You see it suddenly flash, not quite dramatically but a low hum beneath your skin, like a circuit resetting. You realize it – this isn't real. My breath slows. The heat of the argument with Leo, my oldest friend and my biggest critic, bleads cool around the edges. The meticulously placed expressions of anger – his tightened jaw, my reddened cheeks - dissolve slightly at the dream's boundary.

I decided, without actually choosing any words out loud, to *stop*. Not stop the *feeling* of tension co-mingoing in the room, but the outward expression of it all. Slowly, deliberately, I pushed a hand – a gesture completely unconscious of the reality check - into my jacket pocket and withdrew a perfectly smooth river stone, cool and grey in the dim light of Leo's cluttered apartment. 


Then, I extended it towards him. Not offering it as a peace gift, more like… an anomaly.  He hadn't spoken for ages, just glared. The stone sat on the coffee table between us, stark and silent.

Leo’s brow furrowed further. He was staring at the stone, tilting his head. “This…? Why this?” He finally murmured, the anger replaced with a bewildering confusion. 


As I watched his confusion deepen, other shapes in the dream began to shift. Walls smoothed, the furniture subtly altered, like watercolors bleeding together. The arguments, the frustration - they were still *present* in memory, a dull film layering over the present.

Suddenly, my hand wasn’t mine. It was a pale, translucent thing, drifting just before the object of my reflection in the tabletop, and I could feel the quiet, insistent pull to turn and walk right out of this apartment, out of the whole frustrating, heartbreaking exchange and into a soft, lavender dusk. 


Instead of shouting back, instead of deflecting his criticism, I just… moved.  I didn't look back. I simply walked, my spectral hand leading the way towards a vast, open meadow, where fireflies danced in the velvet dark and the air smelled undeniably of rain and regret.  The stone remained on the table, an illogical symbol in a reality that wouldn't acknowledge it, but a small, perfectly formed monument to the decision to simply… shift.

This continued a bit, adding in details about the meadow, sounds of crickets, an underlying sense of being safe from the argument. Would you like me to develop more of this dream, perhaps incorporating a specific element – like a recurring image or theme?
