Okay, dreaming...

You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and...

...you encounter various groups of people and you are overwhelmed by the sheer noise and closeness of everyone. Faces are a blur, voices blend together like static. You push past the first group, feeling their energy press against you – mostly laughing, some arguing, the air thick with different conversations. You bump into someone's elbow, apologise, but your eyes are already scanning frantically the next mass of bodies ahead.

...Next, you lean against a wall near a slightly quieter group gathered around a strange, large aquarium filled with what look like shimmering, glass昆虫 (insects). They are discussing their potential value, dissecting the patterns, murmuring about rarity. You stand by, feeling strangely excluded by their focused intensity, trying not to draw attention as you strain to recall what your friend looks like, the name you're searching for.

...A little later, you find yourself near a group standing around a musician playing an obscure, haunting instrument – maybe a series of chimes, maybe something more fantastical. Their hushed tones and rapt expressions slow your search for a moment. A wave of regret washes over you – maybe you'll never find this one person after all, lost forever in this sea of strangers with their meaningful moments you're not a part of. You feel simultaneously adrift and suffocated.

...Suddenly, you catch a glimpse of a familiar gesture – the way someone tucks their hair behind their ear just like your friend. Hope surges. You angle your path towards them, your footsteps strangely loud on the plush carpet, drawing curious glances as you accelerate, convinced this is it. You're almost there...

...(And then the feeling of falling comes, or the dream shifts... depending on which way it breaks now.)
