...gratefully accept. They don't speak your language, but they communicate with warm smiles and gentle gestures, forming a protective circle around you as they lead you through the labyrinth of neon-lit streets.

You pass food stalls with steam rising into the cold night air, hear the clatter of a distant train, and feel the hum of the city soften beneath the canopy of their quiet presence. You don't know where you're going, but for the first time, the feeling of being lost transforms. It's no longer about being adrift, but about being open to the journey itself.

They lead you to a small, hidden park, an oasis of stillness between the skyscrapers. In the center is a fountain, and one of the strangers points to your reflection in the water. As you look, you see not just yourself, but all of them reflected around you, their kindness now a part of your own image.

You turn to thank them, to ask their names, but they are gone. Yet their absence doesn't feel like a loss. In your pocket, you find a small, smooth stone one of them must have pressed into your hand. You hold it tightly, a tangible touchstone of connection, and you know, with a deep and certain calm, exactly how to find your way home.
