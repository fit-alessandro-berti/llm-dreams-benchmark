notice that the walls begin to shift and change, forming new pathways and closing off old ones. The deeper you go, the more surreal the environment becomes—colors swirl and blend, the floor feels like both solid stone and floating mist. Each puzzle you solve unlocks a symbol that glows faintly in the air, floating beside you like a guiding star.

As you move forward, you encounter a door covered in intricate carvings that seem to rearrange themselves while you watch. There are no visible handles or hinges, but you sense that the next puzzle holds the key. Beside the door stands a figure cloaked in shimmering fabric, their face obscured. They extend a hand, offering you an object that feels both familiar and unknown—an old key, yet it hums with energy, as if alive.

You instinctively take it, and as you do, the entire maze trembles. The walls begin to dissolve into light, revealing an endless sky filled with constellations you somehow understand. The figure speaks in a voice that resonates within you:  

*"You are close to the truth. But will you choose to awaken, or will you journey further into the dream?"*  

At this moment, you feel the weight of a decision forming in your mind. What will you do next?
