You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you... *wake up in a library made of floating books, each one glowing with your own handwriting. The pages flip themselves, revealing tasks that rewrite mid-sentence: "Design a bridge to the moon using only spaghetti and existential dread. Submit by sunrise." Your boss, now a towering figure with a clock for a face, leans in and says, "Time is a construct, but deadlines are not. Start."  

You try to protest, but your voice echoes as a chorus of whispers. The books spiral into a vortex, pulling you into a labyrinth of meeting rooms where every door leads to a different version of your life: one where you’re a chef, a astronaut, a sentient toaster. A coffee machine hums a lullaby that makes you want to cry. You grab a pen from your pocket—it’s made of smoke and insists on writing a report titled *Why the Sky is Made of Regret*.  

As the clock-face boss’s gears grind louder, you realize the project isn’t about work. It’s a test. The deadline isn’t a constraint; it’s a key. You begin to doodle on the report, and the words bleed into the air, forming a portal. Through it, you see your real office, but everything is upside-down. You jump, and the dream shifts: you’re back at your desk, staring at a blank screen, the clock ticking 3:00 AM. Your boss’s voice crackles through the speaker: *"Did you finish it?"*  

You look down. The screen shows a document titled *The Infinite Deadline*, filled with your own handwriting, but the text is shifting—each word dissolving into the next, forever unfinished. You laugh, because you finally understand: the project was never about completion. It was about the story you told yourself while trying.  

And then you wake up, late to work, but with a strange sense of calm. The deadline, you realize, was just a mirror. And you’ve already passed.
