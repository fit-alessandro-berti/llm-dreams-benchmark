...find that the walls themselves begin to shift and reshape, as if the maze is alive. The air grows colder, and faint whispers echo through the corridors, each one a fragment of a riddle. You notice that the puzzles now require not just logic, but an understanding of paradoxes. One chamber presents a door with two levers labeled **A** and **B**. Above them glows a message:  

*"Pull lever A to proceed in 10 breaths. Pull lever B to reset the maze. But if you choose B, you must solve this:  
$$  
\lim_{x \to \infty} \left( \sqrt{x^2 + 3x} - x \right)  
$$  
What is the answer?"*  

You calculate quickly:  
$$  
\sqrt{x^2 + 3x} - x = \frac{(\sqrt{x^2 + 3x} - x)(\sqrt{x^2 + 3x} + x)}{\sqrt{x^2 + 3x} + x} = \frac{3x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 3x} + x}  
$$  
Dividing numerator and denominator by \( x \):  
$$  
\frac{3}{\sqrt{1 + 3/x} + 1} \to \frac{3}{2} \quad \text{as} \quad x \to \infty  
$$  
You shout **"Three halves!"** The lever B clicks, but instead of resetting the maze, the walls collapse into a single corridor leading downward, deeper into darkness.  

Suddenly, a figure emerges—a gaunt, shadowy guide with eyes like flickering candles. "Brava," they say, voice like static. "But the true test is *why* you chose B. What does it signify?"  

You realize: choosing B wasn’t just about solving the math. It was about rejecting the illusion of progress (*A*) for the risk of deeper truth (*B*). The maze mirrors your own mind’s labyrinth.  

The guide smiles, teeth sharp. "Correct. Now solve this: *What shape must you draw to escape, using only the path you’ve already walked?*"  

You trace your steps backward in the air, forming a **Moebius strip**—a single continuous path with no beginning or end. The ground dissolves, and you’re standing outside the maze, sunlight blinding you. But in your palm rests a key made of starlight, still warm.  

You wake up, clutching the sheets, certain the key is real. It isn’t. But the equation \( \sqrt{x^2 + 3x} - x \to \frac{3}{2} \) lingers, etched into your thoughts like a half-remembered truth.  

What did the maze *really* represent? You’ll dream again tonight to find out.
