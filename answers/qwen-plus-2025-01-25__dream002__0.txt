you notice the once-calm trees begin to sway violently in the strengthening wind. The sunlight that had filtered through the canopy moments ago is now replaced by an eerie grayness as dark clouds roll in quickly overhead. You hear the distant rumble of thunder, deep and ominous, vibrating through the air.

As you hurry forward, seeking shelter, the ground beneath your feet shifts slightly—moist leaves and twigs crunching underfoot—but then something strange happens. A faint glow begins to emanate from deeper within the forest, pulsating softly like a heartbeat. It seems to be coming from a small clearing ahead.

Curiosity overtakes fear, and you push onward despite the rain starting to fall in heavy droplets. As you step into the clearing, the storm outside feels muted, almost nonexistent. In the center of the space stands an ancient tree unlike any you've ever seen. Its bark shimmers with iridescent colors, and its branches twist upward toward the sky, tipped with glowing orbs that resemble miniature suns.

The air around the tree hums with energy, and when you reach out tentatively to touch it, the world dissolves into a kaleidoscope of light and sound. Colors swirl around you, blending and separating in patterns too complex to follow. Voices echo in your mind—not words, but emotions, memories, and sensations so vivid they feel like your own.

When the chaos subsides, you find yourself standing on a bridge suspended over an endless expanse of stars. The forest has vanished, replaced by this cosmic landscape where galaxies stretch infinitely below and above. On the other side of the bridge, a figure waits—a person whose face remains just out of focus, yet radiates warmth and familiarity.

They extend their hand, inviting you to cross. Do you take it? Or do you turn back, searching for the path that brought you here?
