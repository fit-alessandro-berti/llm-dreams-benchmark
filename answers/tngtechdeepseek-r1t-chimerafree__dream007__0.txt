You decide to take a deep breath and look into your friend's eyes. As the tension lingers, their face begins to shift—features blurring and reforming, flickering between anger, sadness, and vulnerability. The room around you dissolves like smoke, revealing a vast, twilight-lit landscape. A quiet falls, heavy yet peaceful, and you both stand there, no longer speaking. Words feel unnecessary now; the argument melts into a shared understanding, as if the conflict was merely a bridge to something deeper. You wake with a lingering sense of clarity, the dream’s echo urging you to reach out.
