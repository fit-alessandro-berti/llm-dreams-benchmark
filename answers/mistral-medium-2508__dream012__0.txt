suddenly notice a faint, eerie glow on the horizon—pulsing like a slow heartbeat through the storm’s veil. The wind howls, but the light cuts through it, unnatural and hypnotic. Your first mate, a grizzled sailor with salt-crusted brows, grips the wheel beside you and squints into the darkness. *"Captain… that ain’t no lighthouse."*

The ship groans as a monstrous wave lifts you skyward, suspending you for a breathless moment before crashing down. When the spray clears, the glow is closer—now revealing the silhouette of a vessel *no chart has ever recorded*. Its sails are tattered yet intact, its hull blackened as if scorched by something not of this world. And it’s *moving against the wind*, cutting through the storm like a blade through silk.

Your crew murmurs in dread. The ship’s compass spins wildly, the needle snapping as if repelled. Then, a voice—deep, resonant, and *inside your head*—whispers words in a language you’ve never heard… yet somehow understand:

**"You carry what we seek."**

Your hand drifts to the locket at your neck, the one you’ve worn since the day you found it washed ashore, its engravings worn smooth by time. The metal hums against your skin, warm now, *alive*. The ghostly ship looms closer, its deck crawling with figures—too tall, too still—watching. Waiting.

The storm isn’t just wind and rain anymore. The waves *bend* around the stranger vessel, and the air smells of ozone and something older, like rust and buried things. Your first mate draws a pistol, but the powder is damp, the flint dead. *"Captain,"* he growls, *"what in God’s name do we do?"*

You look at the locket, then at the abyss staring back from the other ship. And you realize:

*You’ve been dreaming of this moment for years.*

**How does the dream end?**
(Do you open the locket? Do you turn the ship and flee? Or do you step onto the deck of the ghostly vessel, where the figures part like shadows to reveal… *yourself*?)
