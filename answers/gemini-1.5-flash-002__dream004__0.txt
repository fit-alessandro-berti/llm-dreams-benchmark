...and a single, iridescent brush.  The brush hummed faintly, a low thrum that vibrated in my fingertips even before I touched it.  The canvas, impossibly smooth and seemingly made of shifting moonlight, pulsed with a faint, internal glow.  Hesitantly, I dipped the brush into the air – nothing.  I dipped it into a nearby puddle of swirling, amethyst liquid – nothing again, except the amethyst dissolved into the brush’s bristles, becoming part of the brush itself.  The humming intensified.

Then I understood.  The canvas wasn't waiting for paint; it was waiting for *emotion*.  Fear, joy, anger – each feeling would manifest as a unique shape and color, directly from the brush.  I closed my eyes, focused on the overwhelming sense of wonder this strange world evoked, and swiped the brush across the canvas.

A spiral of shimmering gold, edged with the deepest violet, bloomed across the surface.  It pulsed with warmth and a sense of infinite possibility.  I felt a surge of exhilaration, and painted a jagged streak of crimson, like lightning across the sky, representing the thrill of the unknown.  Then, a wave of melancholy, a soft grey-blue that resembled a weeping willow, emerged as a delicate, drooping form.

As I painted, the landscape around me changed to reflect the emotions on the canvas.  The gold spiral brought forth fields of sun-drenched flowers, while the crimson lightning sparked a storm of multi-colored butterflies.  The willow's sadness brought a gentle rain, washing the vibrant colors into a soft, harmonious blend.

Finally, exhausted but fulfilled, I stood back, gazing at my ever-shifting masterpiece.  It was a mirror of my dream, a record of my emotions, a vibrant testament to the kaleidoscopic world I found myself in.  And then, as suddenly as it began, the dream faded, leaving only the lingering hum of the iridescent brush in the silent void.
