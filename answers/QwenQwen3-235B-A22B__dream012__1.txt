You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you feel the weight of their trust pressing harder than the waves crashing against the hull. The sky is a roiling canvas of ink-black clouds, and the wind screams like a chorus of vengeful spirits. Your first mate, a weathered sailor with eyes like chipped flint, grips your arm. “She’s takin’ on water, Captain! The men say we should abandon ship!” 

But you know the truth: there’s no lifeboat that could survive these swells. To flee is to drown. You straighten, your oilskin coat flapping like the wings of a bedraggled seabird, and shout above the tempest, “Hold fast! We ride her through!” 

Then you see it—a flicker of green light on the horizon, pulsing in time with the heartbeat thrumming in your skull. A figure stands atop the mast, silhouetted against the lightning: a woman with hair like kelp and eyes like drowned moons. She mouths a single word—*“Sacrifice”*—and suddenly the storm isn’t just around you. It’s *inside* you. Memories claw at your throat: a child’s laughter, a lover’s betrayal, the weight of a blade in your hand on a night you’ve tried to forget. 

The crew begins to scream. Not from fear—from *change*. Their skin hardens into scales, their limbs twist into fins. They’re becoming something else, something ancient. The first mate’s voice is a gurgle, half-human, half-… other. “*The debt… must be paid…*” 

You realize the ship isn’t just a vessel. It’s a prison. And you? You’re the jailer. Or the sacrifice. Or both. 

The sea goddess reaches out a hand, and the waves part to reveal a throne of coral and human bones. Sit. Rule. Forget. Or turn away—and let everyone you’ve ever loved be swallowed by the deep. 

Your hand trembles on the wheel. 

Choose. 

(But dreams don’t end with choices, do they? They end when you wake up gasping, unsure if the salt on your lips is from the sea… or your own tears.)
