You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to step through a doorway that suddenly forms in the air between you. The air shimmers, and you and your friend drift through it as if the space between words has become a hallway.

On the other side is a quiet, moonlit town square. The ground is paved with memories you’ve shared—the first laugh, the stubborn standoffs, the late-night talks that kept you both from walking away. The walls glow softly with the colors of past conversations, not to mock the argument but to remind you of your history together. You realize the door wasn’t about escaping the clash; it was about entering a space where you could listen.

You sit down on a bench that seems to form itself under you, and you invite your friend to do the same. You vow to speak in questions first, and to answer with honesty second. "What would healing look like for us?" you ask, and your friend answers in a careful voice, naming what they fear losing if the rift grows wider. You tell them your own fear—of losing you, of losing the connection that has stood between you for years. The fear is laid bare, but it loosens something in the air; the tension sighs out and dissolves into the night.

A soft wind carries your words away and folds them into a bridge of light that arches over a quiet river of memories. You both step onto the bridge, not to win the argument, but to carry it together. As you walk, you sketch a path that honors both sides: a plan that protects what matters to each of you and a deadline to revisit the hard parts with fresh eyes. The bridge brightens with each concession, each moment of understanding, until you reach the other side, hand in hand, to find the future you both want reflected in the stars.

The dream begins to blur at the edges, the town fading back into the room you started in. You wake with a sense of relief and clarity: the bond is intact, and there is a way forward that honors both your needs. You carry the feeling into waking life, ready to have the real conversation with your friend when you’re ready.
