In the cracked, sun-bleached ruins of what was once a city, the air is thick with the scent of dust, rust, and something faintly metallic—like old blood or the faintest whisper of rain on tin. The sky is a bruised canvas of smog and ash, the sun a pale, distant eye watching over the wasteland. You’re dressed in scavenged layers: a patched-up jacket lined with scavenged insulation, fingerless gloves that hide the calluses on your hands, and boots caked in mud and the occasional bone fragment. Your pack is heavy—water canisters, a rusted knife, a half-empty bag of seeds, and a small, tattered journal where you’ve been scribbling notes about the few things you’ve learned to survive.

You’re not alone, though. The wind carries voices—low, urgent, the kind that doesn’t trust silence. A group of survivors, maybe. Or maybe just raiders. You crouch behind a collapsed concrete pillar, your breath shallow. The journal slips from your fingers, landing with a soft *thud* against the cracked pavement. You don’t have time to pick it up.

Then you see *them*.

A child—no older than eight, maybe—stumbles into view, their small frame hunched under the weight of a backpack twice their size. Their face is streaked with dirt and tears, their eyes wide with something that isn’t just fear. They’re holding a single, perfect apple, its skin unblemished, its red glow almost too bright in the dim light. It shouldn’t exist here. Apples rot in weeks. This one looks like it was plucked from a tree yesterday.

The child sees you. Their lips move, but no sound comes out. They press the apple into your palm, then turn and runs—vanishing into the skeletal remains of a grocery store, where the shelves once groaned under the weight of canned goods and fresh produce.

You stare at the apple. It’s warm. Almost *pulsing*. The journal is still within reach. You could grab it. You could run. But something in you—something that’s been dormant for months—*remembers* the taste of sweetness. The last time you ate something fresh was before the Great Collapse. Before the world ended.

You take a bite.

The flavor explodes in your mouth—juicy, tart, *alive*. Your stomach growls, betraying you. The apple is gone in seconds. But as you swallow the last bite, something shifts inside you. The world around you seems to *tilt*. The ruins don’t look so hopeless anymore. The wind carries not just voices, but *hints*—fragments of a language you almost recognize, a melody from a song you’ve forgotten you knew.

Then the ground trembles.

Not an earthquake. Something *else*. A low, rhythmic *thump-thump-thump*, like a heartbeat. The child’s backpack. The apple’s core. The journal.

You look down. Your hands are covered in faint, glowing veins—like the apple’s, like the child’s. And in the distance, where the child ran, a single tree sprouts from the rubble. Its leaves are unnaturally green, its branches twisting toward the sky like a hand reaching up.

You have a choice:
1. **Follow the child.** The tree is a sign. The apple was a test. But the wasteland is full of traps—and worse, things that wear faces.
2. **Stay and investigate the glow.** The veins in your hands could mean something. A mutation? A gift? Or a curse that will make you the next target for scavengers or worse.
3. **Run.** Grab the journal, find shelter, and wait. Maybe the apple was a hallucination. Maybe the world is still ending, and you’re just another fool chasing ghosts.

What do you do?
