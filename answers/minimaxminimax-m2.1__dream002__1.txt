The air shifts first—that subtle charge that precedes something inevitable. The pine scent gives way to something metallic, sharp on your tongue. Leaves rustle not from wind, but from some collective tension rippling through the branches above. Shafts of pale gold pierce through gaps in the canopy, casting long shadows that seem too sharp, too deliberate for a natural sky.

You quicken your pace, but the forest seems to stretch and warp around you. Paths that felt familiar moments ago now curve in unexpected directions. The birds have gone silent—that's what unsettles you most. Just minutes ago, their songs wove through the underbrush like living thread. Now only the distant rumble answers, growing closer, more insistent.

The first fat drops of rain begin to fall, each one landing on leaves and earth with surprising loudness. They leave dark, spreading kisses on the forest floor. You find shelter beneath an ancient oak, its bark rough and grounding against your palm, and watch as the world transforms. Lightning fractures the darkening sky—not bolts, but sheets of pale fire that illuminate the storm clouds rolling in like living things. The rain intensifies, drumming a rhythm that seems almost like language, almost like meaning, just beyond your understanding.

Somewhere in the distance, through the curtain of water and shadow, you glimpse a structure—a cottage, perhaps, or a shrine—its windows glowing with amber light. It wasn't there before. It might not be there at all. But you find yourself stepping out from beneath the oak's protective arms, drawn toward that impossible glow, as the storm reaches its crescendo around you.
