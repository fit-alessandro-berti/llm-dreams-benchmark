…and you feel the deck shudder beneath your boots as another wave slams the hull.

You grab the rail to steady yourself. Salt spray lashes your face, cold and sharp, but the pain is distant, like it belongs to someone else. Lanterns swing wildly, throwing crazed circles of light over frightened faces. The sky is a solid wall of black, stitched with white veins of lightning that seem too close, too loud, too bright.

“Captain!” your first mate shouts over the wind. “Orders?”

You open your mouth to answer—and realize you don’t know.

For a heartbeat, the dream goes strangely quiet. The roar of the storm muffles, as if you’ve ducked your head underwater. You feel it then: the soft, unreal give of the world around you. This is a dream.

The knowledge doesn’t wake you up. It just settles over your shoulders like a cloak.

You straighten.

“Reef the topsails!” you shout, voice suddenly steady, cutting through the chaos. “Bring her into the wind. We ride this out.”

The crew moves instantly. Ropes hiss through calloused hands, sails whip and snap overhead. The ship groans but responds, angling her bow toward the monstrous, heaving dark. For a moment it feels like pointing yourself directly into a punch.

The wind screams. The mast tilts. A barrel breaks loose and rockets across the deck before smashing into the rail, exploding into splinters like firework sparks. Somewhere, someone cries out in pain—but when you look, their face is blurred, smeared like wet paint.

It doesn’t matter. You know what this storm is.

You step up to the wheel. The spokes are slick, but when your hands close around them, they fit perfectly, as if they were carved for you alone. A huge wave rears up in front of you, so tall it blocks what little horizon there is. It’s not just water. It’s memories, voices, doubts—every failure you can remember, rising over you in a black wall.

*You’re not ready.*
*You’re going to lose them.*
*You’re going to sink.*

The wave crashes.

For a moment there is nothing but white: white noise, white water, white fear. The ship drops sickeningly, as if the sea has been pulled out from under you. Your stomach lurches; your crew screams; the wheel bucks like a living thing in your hands.

You hold on.

You remember: you are dreaming.

So you decide.

With a breath that feels like inhaling lightning, you *choose* the world. You choose the outcome. You imagine the keel holding, the boards flexing but not breaking. You imagine the ship slicing through the wave instead of being swallowed by it.

Reality—this strange, liquid dream-reality—listens.

The ship punches through the wave, breaks the surface with a shuddering roar, and rises. Water pours off the deck in shining sheets. The crew blinks in stunned silence for half a second, and in that silence you feel it: the storm has changed.

It’s still raging, but the malice has gone out of it. The waves are tall but they have shape now, a rhythm you can read. The wind still howls, but it’s a language you almost understand.

“Keep her steady!” you call. “We follow the light!”

“The what?” someone yells back.

You point.

There—through a rent in the clouds—a single star has punched a pinhole in the dark. It shouldn’t be visible in a sky like this, but it is; small, clear, impossibly still. As soon as you focus on it, something tight in your chest loosens, like a knot pulled free.

“That star,” you say. “Hold our course to it.”

No one questions that this is possible.

The ship moves like it’s been waiting for this direction all along. The wheel becomes lighter under your hands. Each adjustment feels intuitive: a little to port, ease the sails, give the hull room to rise and fall. You’re no longer fighting the sea; you’re dancing with it, letting it lift and drop you in great slow breaths.

Around you, the dream sharpens. Faces gain detail—scarred cheeks, crooked noses, tired eyes that trust you. You hear individual sounds now: the creak of rigging, the slap of waves against wood, the rasp of your own breathing. Your fear hasn’t vanished, but it’s standing *behind* you instead of in front of you.

“Captain,” your first mate says quietly, stepping to your side. His voice is calmer now. “Think we’ll make it?”

You look ahead at the star. The clouds around it are thinning, ragged at the edges. You can feel dry air somewhere beyond the storm, waiting, patient.

“We already are,” you say.

As you speak, the dream shifts again.

The sea begins to flatten, turbulence easing into long, rolling swells. The rain softens from needles to mist. Thunder drifts away to the horizon like a tantrum that has spent itself. The sky cracks open; bands of deep blue appear between the clouds, like bruises healing in fast-forward.

Your crew laughs—first in disbelief, then with wild relief. Someone claps you on the shoulder, another slaps the rail and whoops at the calming waves.

You look down at your hands on the wheel and notice something strange: they’re fading at the edges, fingers blurring like fog. Through them, you can see the polished wood, the grain running in gentle spirals.

“Tide’s changing,” your first mate says.

You know he doesn’t mean the sea.

The star ahead grows brighter, stretching into a pale path over the water, a bridge of reflected light leading toward the thinning dark. You feel a pull behind your eyes, a familiar weight: the sense of your body lying somewhere else, still and waiting.

You could stay and sail on, you think. Turn this into an endless voyage through impossible oceans, storms that bow to your will, horizons that always hold new wonders.

But the dream was never really about the storm or the ship.

It was about this feeling: hands on the wheel, heart pounding, fear present but not in charge. The moment you realized that even in the middle of the chaos, you could choose your direction.

You turn to your crew, to all these half-real people who watched you stand your ground.

“Hold her steady,” you say. “You know what to do now.”

They nod like they understand, like they’ve always understood. As you step back from the wheel, the world brightens to a soft, impossible white—not blinding, just… open.

The last thing you feel is the phantom sway of the deck beneath your feet, the taste of salt on your lips, and the quiet, solid certainty that when the storms come again—waking or sleeping—you’ll remember this:

The sea can roar.
The sky can fracture.
But your hands still choose where to turn the wheel.

And with that thought, you wake.
