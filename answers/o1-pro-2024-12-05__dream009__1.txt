You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to understand where you are and how you arrived here. You find yourself sitting on the edge of a wooden cot in a small, dimly lit cottage. The room smells faintly of straw and damp earth, the rough-hewn beams overhead crisscrossing like the ribs of an overturned ship. It’s just before dawn; a pale glow seeps through a single, narrow window. Outside, the distant bleating of goats or sheep echoes over what sounds like a quiet village.   

Your clothes aren’t the ones you remember going to sleep in. Instead, you’re wearing a coarse linen tunic that scratches faintly at your neck and wrists. Your feet are bare, and the floor is packed dirt. Along one wall, a clay jug sits on a table next to a half loaf of bread. Beneath the table lies a shallow wooden bowl of hazy water, possibly collected rainwater or something meant for washing. There’s no sign of the neat, manufactured furniture or polished surfaces you’re accustomed to—just simple, handcrafted objects, as though you’ve stepped into a living museum exhibit.   

Your heart beats faster as you pick yourself up and move to the window. You raise your head to peer outside and see a tiny cluster of cottages set along a dirt path. Beyond them, fields stretch, mist-shrouded and golden in the dawn light. In the distance, a handful of figures dressed in rough wool and linen make their way through the fields, tending to something you can’t quite make out. No cars, no power lines, not even a distant hum of electricity. This place is silent, save for the gentle sounds of nature and soft voices of villagers starting their day.

You have to figure out what century this might be—perhaps the Middle Ages, or some other pre-modern period. You try to recall your history lessons. Are these peasants? You notice that none of them carry firearms; instead, one man shoulders a wooden hoe, and a woman lifts a basket of grain. The architecture suggests a small farming community, maybe in Europe, and the limited light makes it hard to discern details. What could you learn if you step outside?

But before you do, your stomach grumbles. The bread on the table looks simple but nourishing. You tear off a piece. It’s dense, coarse, and a bit sour. With nothing else to rely on, you take a few bites to settle your nerves and fill your belly. As your senses sharpen with each moment you remain in this strange environment, the truth begins to sink in: you need to find a way to survive here. You need clothing, shelter, a way to communicate, and, most importantly, a role you can play within this community. If you’re stuck here, you’ll need to learn the language, the customs, and the means by which these people keep themselves fed and safe.

You exit the cottage carefully, pushing aside the flimsy door made of woven branches and a rough hide stretched taut. The cool morning air greets you. A middle-aged man, broad-shouldered with sun-creased skin, looks up from where he’s fastening a donkey’s harness to a small wooden cart. He nods at you curtly, giving no sign of surprise. Perhaps you look no different from the people here. Perhaps in this dream—or reality—you’ve taken on an appearance that blends in.

“Can you tell me where I am?” you ask, the words tumbling out in your own familiar tongue. He narrows his eyes, frowns, and says something you can’t decipher. The words are harsh and guttural, or maybe just unfamiliar. You gesture around, trying to convey confusion. He grimaces, then taps the donkey’s flank and begins to lead it away, down the narrow track between cottages. Others also look at you quizzically, exchanging sidelong glances. They seem neither hostile nor welcoming, merely wary.

It’s clear now: communication will be a challenge. You’ll need to pick up words, gestures, and norms. Without that, you could starve, or become an outcast, or be deemed suspicious. You think of your old life—smartphones, internet searches, online translators—and realize all of that is gone. Now you must rely on observation, repetition, and careful mimicry.

You decide to explore the outskirts of the village. If you can understand how they produce their food, store it, and share it, you might find a way to offer help. As you wander, you come across a small field planted with root vegetables—turnips or beets, perhaps—and two women pulling them from the earth. One is older, with a lined face and shoulders bowed from years of labor; the other is younger, maybe her daughter, her bright eyes looking you over curiously. You tentatively step closer, pointing at a turnip and then at yourself, trying to convey a willingness to help. The younger woman smiles shyly and nods. She reaches out and hands you a small wooden tool for digging. You mimic her movements, kneeling and gently loosening the soil around the root. Despite your clumsy start, this may be your best route: to lend a hand and become less of a stranger.

As the morning passes, you labor beside them, your knees damp and your hands dark with soil. Eventually, they pause and the older woman offers you a clay cup of cool water. You drink gratefully, managing a small bow of thanks. You listen as they speak to each other, trying to catch the cadence of their language. You repeat a sound or two under your breath—just enough to start connecting images to words.

Time flows differently here. There are no clocks, just the position of the sun. As midday approaches, a bell-like sound rings from somewhere near the center of the village. Everyone seems to take notice. The pair you’ve been working with gather up their harvested roots in a rough sack and gesture for you to follow. They lead you back toward a communal fire pit, where others are sitting on stools carved from tree trunks. Bread, legumes, and some kind of porridge are shared around.  

You realize as you sit and eat among them that you are taking your first steps into this world: here, survival depends on community and cooperation. Without modern technology, without your old identity, you must build trust. Perhaps in time, you’ll learn how you got here and how to return home—or perhaps you will find a new sense of purpose in the gentle rhythms of this simpler life.

And so, as the sun climbs in a clear blue sky, you settle into this new era, uncertain but determined, preparing to take on the roles and skills that will allow you not only to live but to belong.
