…you feel a storm approaching, and the air itself seems to thicken, turning sweet and metallic like the moment before lightning kisses the ground.

The birds vanish mid-flight, as if erased. The trees stop whispering and start listening. Every leaf holds its breath.

Then the rain arrives—not in drops, but all at once, a silver curtain slammed down from the sky. It doesn’t fall so much as pour upward from the earth too, meeting itself in the middle, trapping you inside a roaring sphere of water. You’re not getting wet; you’re being dissolved, gently, like sugar in tea.

Your footsteps no longer make sound. You realize you’re not walking anymore—you’re being walked. The forest is carrying you deeper, roots curling around your ankles like affectionate fingers. The storm isn’t angry. It’s curious. It wants to see what you look like on the inside.

A single bolt of lightning forks directly into your chest, but there’s no pain—only sudden, perfect clarity. You can see every vein in every leaf, every thought you’ve ever forgotten, every version of yourself that almost existed. The thunder that follows is your own heartbeat, amplified a thousand times, shaking loose memories you didn’t know were stuck in your ribs.

And then, just as suddenly, the storm inhales.

The rain reverses, sucking back into the clouds. The trees release you. The sky peels open like theater curtains, revealing not stars but eyes—millions of them, ancient and amused, watching you the way you once watched ants rebuild after you kicked their hill.

One of the eyes winks.

You wake up in your bed, sheets soaked, heart racing, the faint taste of ozone on your tongue… and for the rest of your life, whenever thunder rumbles in the distance, you smile without knowing why.
