You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you *feel the weight of the clock ticking*â€”*five minutes, four minutes, three...*â€”the *digital countdown* flashes red. You glance at your monitor, *the screen glowing like a dying star*, and panic. Your hands shake as you pull out your phone, *the screen displaying a list of tasksâ€”*research, data analysis, video scriptâ€”*but each task feels like a mountain* atop a mountain. Your breath catches. You *reach for a pen* and *write* in the air, *but the words blur*, *the ink smudges*.  

The boss leans in, *eyes narrowed, a stern smile*. "Youâ€™re *not* supposed to be here. This is *everyoneâ€™s* project. Youâ€™re the only one who can finish it by tomorrow night." You *clench your fists*, your knuckles white. *Youâ€™ve spent weeks* preparing, *but now youâ€™re standing in the middle of a storm*â€”*the storm of your own insecurities* and *the storm of deadlines*.  

You *type furiously*, *the screen *lighting up* with your frantic keystrokes, but the *code is wrong*, *the data is off*, *the presentation is a disaster*. You *look up*, *the bossâ€™s gaze boring into you*, and you *realize*â€”*this is the first time* youâ€™ve ever *felt* like *a failure*. You *try to scream*, *but your voice is gone*.  

Then, *the clock strikes midnight*. You *look at your screen*â€”*the deadline is *now*â€”*but the *code is still blank*. You *collapse* into your chair, *your head pounding* as the *world fades into silence*.
