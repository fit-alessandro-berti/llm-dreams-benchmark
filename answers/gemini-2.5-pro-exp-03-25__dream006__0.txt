...begin to **speak, but instead of words, a stream of shimmering, colorful ribbons spools out of my mouth.** First a bright, insistent scarlet, then a calming azure, followed by a cascade of emerald, gold, and violet. They flow silently, gracefully, into the vast space above the crowd.

My mind scrambles – *this isn't right!* I try to clamp my mouth shut, but the ribbons simply phase through my lips, weaving intricate patterns in the air like tangible thoughts. I glance desperately at the audience, expecting gasps or confusion. But they just watch, their faces tilted upwards, eyes wide with a calm, almost hypnotic focus. Some even have faint smiles, as if this is precisely the sort of eloquence they came for.

The ribbons drift down, brushing gently against shoulders, weaving through rows. A person in the front row tentatively reaches out, and a silver ribbon curls around their finger before stretching across the aisle to link with a golden strand near someone else. Slowly, impossibly, a delicate, shimmering web begins to form, connecting person to person, row to row, linking them all to me standing on the stage, bathed in the warm glow of the spotlight which now seems to be *made* of liquid light itself.

The silence in the hall is profound, broken only by a faint, almost inaudible humming, like the resonance of the colours themselves. My panic melts away, replaced by a strange sense of awe and understanding. I look down at my hands – the notes I thought I was holding are now blank sheets of paper, covered in intricate, swirling doodles that mirror the ribbons dancing in the air. I realize, with a certainty only dreams provide, that I *am* giving the speech. This *is* the communication. Not words, but connection, woven from silence and light, and somehow, everyone understands perfectly. I take a deep breath, and exhale another stream of pure, flowing amethyst.
