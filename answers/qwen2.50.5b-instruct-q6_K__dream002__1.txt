Oh, so it's springtime! Let's see what happens next.

As I wander the forest, my vision is dimmed by the raindrops hitting my face. The trees sway gently underfoot as if they are holding their own rain umbrella to me. Suddenly, something flashes before my eyes - a tree tips and falls into the forest clearing at my side!

The ground beneath my feet splits open in an instant, and a massive storm envelops the forest.

You hear the wind whistling through my hair, carrying the scent of the rain and the sweet aroma of freshly cut trees. But something is off about this weather pattern - instead of clear skies and gentle winds, the atmosphere looks... murky!

I feel a surge of excitement as I realize that it's not just any storm - there are dark clouds gathering above, indicating the possibility of another heavy storm brewing nearby.

Without hesitation, I stand up in front of the clearing. To my left, a gusty wind pushes up a thick cloud wall so high they're like spears of gray sky overhead.

I pull myself together and take a deep breath before speaking to you, "I feel this situation is just more of our storm's recipe working on us too." 

Then I hold up an umbrella and explain with conviction: “And that... your life will grow from the storm. So find a safe place if needed and stay tuned for another surprise in the form of your own journey.”

With that, my heart beats as the skies darken suddenly into the depths of what we might call "stormy times." But no matter, I say in a reassuring tone: “I'm here with you! Keep coming."

The storm passes quickly. We share words on the horizon which will help everyone feel even more secure:

"Even though it's dark outside, things can suddenly change your life to light!"

So next time this happens, remember to count your blessings and just move forward because the biggest weather always finds a new way to show up.
