**Dream Continuation:**

You start to frantically check your pockets, finding a crumpled note with an address smudged beyond recognition. The streets around you twist and morph, neon signs flickering in languages you don’t understand. A clock tower tolls ominously—*thirty minutes left*. Panic rises, but then you notice a trail of glowing arrows etched into the pavement, faint as whispers. You follow them, dodging crowds of faceless figures, their murmurs blending into a staticky hum.  

A shopkeeper with mirrored sunglasses motions you closer. “You’re late,” they say, handing you a key shaped like an hourglass. Behind them, a staircase spirals underground. You descend, walls pulsating with Escher-like geometry, until you reach a door marked by a symbol from the note. The key fits.  

Inside, a boardroom stretches endlessly, filled with shadows in business attire. At the head of the table sits your childhood pet, now speaking in your boss’s voice. “You’ve always known the way,” it says, gesturing to a window showing your own home. The clock strikes the hour, and you wake with a gasp, the dream’s logic dissolving—but the key, impossibly, rests in your clenched fist.
