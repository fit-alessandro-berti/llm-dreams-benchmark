instinctively pick up a brush that appears in your hand. Without thinking, you begin to paint. Every stroke you make bursts into life, swirling out of the canvas into three-dimensional shapes that dance and shimmer in impossible hues. As your creativity flows, the world around you harmonizes with your imagination — mountains transform into flowing rivers of color, skies ripple like liquid glass, and unfamiliar creatures peek curiously from behind shifting forms.

Suddenly, you realize the canvas isn’t just responding to your touch: it is a portal. Stepping closer, the vivid swirl of colors expands, inviting you in. Taking a deep breath, you step through. The sensation is weightless, like floating through a dream within a dream. On the other side, the landscape settles just for a moment — and you find yourself in a place entirely of your own creation, where every thought shapes reality, and the boundaries between imagination and the world dissolve completely.
