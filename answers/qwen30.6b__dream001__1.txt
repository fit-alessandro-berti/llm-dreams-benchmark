You start to mentally map the city’s layout and the path to your meeting. The air is heavy with the hum of traffic and the faint scent of distant forests, a reminder of the unknown. You tense as you prepare to enter, realizing the clock ticks close. With a deep breath, you step forward, the weight of the moment pressing down on you. The meeting’s agenda—something that could change everything—and the time left to act all but make you question if this is the right choice. You look ahead, and the city’s pulse grows louder, a silent promise of change. You close your eyes, and the dream fades into a blend of anticipation and the weight of the decision at hand.
