…and so you weave your way through the crowd, feeling the subtle weight of too many eyes drifting over you without recognition. The room is surprisingly vast—elegant arched ceilings disappear into warm lantern light, and distant chatter hums like soft waves rolling onto a shore. You remember arriving with your friend—let’s call them Alena—because of their bright scarf that was easy to spot. But now, that scarf is nowhere in sight, and you feel as if you’ve stepped into a foreign world that’s gently amused at your confusion.

You pause at the first group to your left: four individuals in evening gowns and tuxedos stand in a loose circle, each holding a small porcelain teacup. They’re talking about something that sounds suspiciously like the behavior of constellations, as if Orion and Cassiopeia were subjects at a finishing school. You catch a few words—“He used to be brighter,” one says, gesturing with a delicate twist of their wrist, “but he’s become dreadfully dull.” Another chuckles, and before you realize it, they all turn to look at you simultaneously. Their faces are kind, but their eyes are distant. “Did you see Alena?” you venture, but they only smile and respond in a language you don’t quite understand. Somehow, you grasp a meaning along the lines of: *Alena danced away toward the music, didn’t she?* Then they all resume chatting as if you never spoke, leaving you to drift onward.

You move toward a cluster of people near the banquet table. They wear mismatched attire—one is in a vintage leather jacket and a tie-dyed bandana, another in a shimmering gown of emerald sequins, and a third looks like they stepped straight out of a painting from the Romantic era, ruffled collar and all. They’re discussing the flavors of a dessert you can’t see—something that tastes, according to them, like “summer afternoons and the laughter of old friends.” When you ask if they have seen Alena, they point silently to a corner of the grand hall. You think you see your friend’s scarf trailing behind a tall figure, so you hurry away.

You push gently through another group, these people forming a shape that almost resembles the petals of a flower. Each member of this circle is telling a fragment of a story, their voices layered in overlapping whispers that form a haunting chorus: “She found it hidden in the old clock…,” “A letter meant to be read under candlelight…,” “If you listen closely, you can still hear her music in the rafters….” The atmosphere thickens, and you feel as though you’ve wandered into a theater backstage, where everyone is a character rehearsing a play you’ve never heard of. Leaning in, you try to piece together what they’re saying, but the words slip through your memory like water through your fingers. They don’t acknowledge your question about Alena. Instead, one figure gently rests a hand on your shoulder, as if to say: *You’ll find what you seek if you follow the sound.*

You continue through the gathering. The scent of spiced wine and candle wax drifts through the air, and a gentle waltz plays in the background—soft strings plucked by unseen musicians. You realize something peculiar: each group you pass seems to offer not a direct answer, but a clue that tugs you further along. One group gifts you with a half smile and points to a painting on the wall: it’s a grand oil painting of a masked figure in a garden of red roses, holding a scarf that looks like Alena’s. Another group hums quietly, nodding in unison toward a large set of doors at the far end of the hall. The doors are carved with intricate scenes—forests, rivers, and silhouettes dancing under full moons.

You move closer to those doors, and as you do, the music grows louder. Between shoulders and elbows you catch a glimpse of someone: Alena’s scarf trailing behind their shoulder, red and gold threads catching the candlelight. You call out their name, but the cacophony of voices and violin strings swallow your words.

At last, you reach the carved doors and push them open, expecting to find a quiet corridor or another crowded room. Instead, you step into a starlit courtyard, open to the night. The muffled hum of the gathering fades behind you. Lanterns hang from crooked iron hooks, illuminating mossy stones and clusters of pale flowers. At the center stands Alena, still wearing the scarf, smiling as if she’s been waiting for you all along.

“I wondered if you’d make it,” Alena says softly. “It’s quite a place, isn’t it?” Their tone suggests that they know how strange this evening has been for you, how you’ve drifted through fragments of conversations and cryptic hints. Together, you stand under the quiet shimmer of the sky, the distant murmur of laughter and conversation drifting through those open doors. You feel a calm settle over you, a gentle assurance that in this dreamscape, the journey to find your friend was as meaningful as the reunion itself.

Alena takes your hand, and as the dream begins to blur at the edges, you understand something: you have not only found your companion, but a soft, secret corner of this world where both of you belong, if only for this one fleeting, enchanted night.
