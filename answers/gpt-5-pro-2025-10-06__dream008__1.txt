…and you nod as if “start” is a verb you’ve always known. You flip open your laptop. The screen blooms white, then shows a countdown with no numbers, just a spinning little circle that looks exactly like your boss’s wedding ring.

“Clock’s ticking,” your boss says, but no clock is visible. Everyone else keeps typing in perfect silence, fingers moving like printers.

You try to ask, “What’s the scope?” but your voice prints itself out as a sticky note: SCOPE: EVERYTHING. DUE: YESTERDAY. The note flutters once, then pins itself to your chest.

Fine. You pick up a pen. The pen draws a rectangle by itself. The rectangle deepens into a door labeled START. You touch the knob and slide into a hallway that didn’t exist five seconds ago. On both sides: Conference Room A, Conference Room A, Conference Room A, an endless copy-paste.

You open the nearest door. Inside, the project is an hourglass filled with salt. A sign reads, ADD FEATURES. You pour in more grains, and the hourglass grows heavier until it leans into your palm with the weight of a small planet. The salt tastes like pretzels and panic. You put it down and back out, sorry.

Next room: the project is a choir of spreadsheets singing in harmonies you almost understand. Their cells light up in chords—VLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH—then all the columns shift three inches to the left and the formulas break. You try to hum along but your mouth fills with pivot tables.

Third room: a single blank document on a table. This feels promising. You sit. The keyboard letters are hieroglyphs, but your hands seem to know them. You type the first sentence: It begins like this. The words crawl off the screen and become a thin rope on the table. You pick it up. It’s warm. You feed it back into the laptop and the document inhales, like a sail catching wind.

Behind you, your boss clears his throat without opening the door. The sound arrives through the vents, wrapped in perfume and approval-seeking. “Status?”

“In progress,” you answer, and the vents exhale calendar pages that whirl around you like gulls. Each page slaps against the wall and sticks. 8:00 AM. 8:00 AM. 8:00 AM. Time has jammed.

You peel one page off and discover underneath it a small window cut into the drywall. On the other side of the window: your desk, your coffee, your boss, waiting. He’s folding and unfolding his hands, making little paper cranes out of impatience. He looks up and somehow sees you watching him from this other angle. He mouths, Start.

You look down at the sentence-rope. It’s longer now. You clip it with your badge and throw one end toward the door labeled START. The rope catches the sign and drags it to you. You turn the sign around. On the back, in pencil: Keep it small enough to begin.

All at once the hallway compresses. The repeating conference rooms pop like bubble wrap. The laptop shrinks to the size of a paperback you can hold in one hand. Your boss’s voice, still coming through the vent, loses its edge and turns into the soft beep of a microwave finishing something.

You step back out through the drawn door, carrying the book-sized project. The office looks the same, only everything has slid a few inches closer, as if you took a picture and nudged the zoom. Your chair greets you by name. The overhead lights settle into an afternoon color even though it’s nine in the morning. Your boss is right there, sleeves rolled, a constellation of coffee dots on his tie like spilled seconds.

“Well?” he says, and now his wedding ring is the little loading circle again, spinning lazily.

You put the small project on the desk. “I cut it to something we can finish today,” you say, and the word today folds itself into a neat rectangle you can put in your pocket.

He blinks. “Is that allowed?”

In the ceiling grid, a sprinkler nods. Your inbox—visible in the corner of your vision as if your eyes have tabs—quietly marks three hundred emails as already answered. Somewhere far away, a printer finishes a job it started in another decade and sighs.

You open the tiny document. Inside it are only three tasks. Each one has a checkbox. The boxes are the size of freckles. You check the first one and the office tilts toward relief. The second takes the sharp taste out of the air. At the third, your laptop purrs and a clean, unshowy sentence appears on the wall where the window used to be:

Started work is lighter than imagined work.

Your boss reads it. He looks taller by exactly the height of your worry leaving. “Good,” he says. He means it.

The room changes temperature in a way you recognize from elevators and first drafts. Something in you remembers that this is a dream, because the coffee tastes like childhood campfire, and the lid on the cup is actually a clock face with no hands. You peel the clock-lid back and put it on the desk. It doesn’t move. You do.

You click send on something brief and clear. It flies down the hallway like a paper airplane that knows the route home. The countdown on your screen dissolves, not to zero but to a small green dot that says here.

The office door swings open without a hand on it. People from other floors drift in, not to interrupt but to inhabit: a plant from Facilities walks past wearing a badge and offers you a leaf to high-five. The copier whispers, “Nice pace.” The fire alarm tries to start, then thinks better of it and turns into distant rain. You keep checking boxes. Each check makes the room a little more the size of your lungs.

“Is it done?” your boss asks one more time, but now it sounds like a routine, like washing your hands.

You look at the little book of a project, now a little lighter, and at the clock-lid, still handless, and at the sentence on the wall. “It’s starting,” you say. In the dream, that counts.

Everyone nods, even the chair. Your boss’s ring stops spinning and becomes a ring again, a quiet shape resting on a finger. He smiles in the practical way of meetings ending.

You glance at the door labeled START. It opens a fraction, just enough to let in fresh air and the sound of something happy happening down the hall. You breathe. The sticky note on your chest peels off by itself and lands on the desk. The word DUE revises to DO.

You do. And the deadline—unable to find a place to die—wanders off, bored, and forgets you.
