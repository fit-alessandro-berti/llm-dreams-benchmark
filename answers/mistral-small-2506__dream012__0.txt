**Dream Sequence:**

The ship groans under the weight of the storm, its timbers creaking like an old man’s bones. The sky is a churning mass of black and violet, lightning splitting the horizon in jagged forks. The waves rise like mountains, threatening to swallow the vessel whole.

Your crew—faces pale, eyes wide with fear—cluster around you, waiting for your command. The first mate grips the wheel, knuckles white, while the navigator clutches a flickering lantern, its light barely piercing the downpour.

You feel the weight of their trust, the responsibility pressing down like the storm itself. The ship lurches violently, and a cry erupts from the deck as a wave crashes over the bow, drenching everyone in icy saltwater.

Then—silence.

The wind dies. The waves still.

A hush falls over the crew. The storm has vanished, replaced by an eerie calm. The sea is glassy, reflecting a sky now a deep, unnatural indigo. The air hums with something… *alive*.

And then you see it.

A figure stands at the edge of the ship, where the deck meets the water. Tall, draped in tattered robes, their face hidden beneath a hood. The sea parts around them, as if the ocean itself bows to their presence.

The crew gasps, some falling to their knees. You step forward, heart pounding, and the figure raises a hand—

**What happens next?**

(Do they speak? Do they vanish? Is this a test? A warning? A dream within a dream?)
