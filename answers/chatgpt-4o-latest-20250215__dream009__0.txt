navigate this unfamiliar world carefully. The air is thick with the scent of wood smoke, and the hum of distant voices echoes through the stone alleyways. You find yourself in what appears to be a medieval town, with market stalls lining the streets, merchants shouting their wares, and townsfolk clad in simple tunics and cloaks.

Your clothing feels out of place—your modern fabrics stand out among the rough wool and linen of the townspeople. You instinctively reach for your phone, only to remember it doesn’t exist here. Panic rises for a moment, but you push it down. You need a plan.

As you walk, trying to blend in, a parchment nailed to a wooden post catches your eye. The script is ornate, but you can make out enough words to realize it’s a royal decree. It speaks of a missing heir, a mysterious prophecy, and a great reward for anyone who can unravel an age-old secret.

Your heart beats faster. If you’re trapped in this time, you need allies, food, and shelter. Maybe this prophecy is a way to secure all three. Or maybe, just maybe, it holds the key to why you’re here.

A voice interrupts your thoughts.  
“You look lost,” says a hooded figure, stepping from the shadows. “And perhaps... out of time.”  

What do you do?
