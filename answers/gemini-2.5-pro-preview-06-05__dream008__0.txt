...look at your boss to ask a question, but his face is no longer a face. It’s a large, round clock, its hands spinning wildly, moving toward a deadline that feels seconds away. The ticking is a deafening drumbeat that echoes in your bones.

You turn to your computer, but the keyboard has been replaced by a single, smooth, white stone. The screen is dark, reflecting your own panicked expression. The project brief, you realize, wasn't handed to you. It was sung to you by a choir of pigeons perched on the window sill, a melody of impossible tasks about "cataloging the color blue" and "bottling the scent of nostalgia."

Your colleagues are no help. They're all diligently working, but on bizarre tasks. Susan from accounting is knitting a ladder out of spaghetti. Mark from IT is carefully pouring the ocean from one teacup into another, trying not to spill a drop. They all seem to understand their assignments perfectly.

Panic claws at your throat. The clock-boss ticks louder. You have to do *something*. You pick up the smooth, white stone. It's cool and heavy in your palm. Without thinking, you place it in your mouth.

It doesn't taste like a stone. It tastes like quiet.

The frantic ticking of the clock-boss softens to a gentle, rhythmic pulse. The pigeon-choir's song becomes a soothing hum. You close your eyes, and the project becomes clear. You don't need a keyboard or a brief. The task is to simply sit here, in the eye of the storm, and hold onto this single, perfect moment of stillness.

You feel a profound sense of accomplishment. The pressure is gone. You've met the deadline.

Your boss, now with a normal face, pats you on the shoulder. "Excellent work," he says, his voice a low, rumbling purr. "Just what we needed."

You smile, the taste of quiet still on your tongue, and watch as Susan's spaghetti ladder reaches all the way to the moon hanging outside the office window.
