As you step onto the stage, the crowd's expectant gaze knots your stomach. You clear your throat, palms damp, and begin to speak. But instead of words, a shimmering butterfly emerges from your lips. Then another. Soon, a kaleidoscope of them floods the air, each winged creature glowing with fragments of your speech—quotes on resilience, innovation, hope. The audience leans forward, eyes wide with wonder, as the butterflies alight on their hands and shoulders, dissolving into gentle sparks of light. A murmur ripples through the crowd, not of judgment, but of shared awe. In that moment, you understand: your voice has transcended fear, transformed into something alive and universal. The weight lifts. You smile, and the stage beneath you blooms into a field of wildflowers, the dream melting into warmth.
