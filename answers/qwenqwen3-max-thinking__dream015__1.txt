...decide to **plant a garden**.

It sounds foolish, maybe. The sky is still stained the color of rust from the old wars, the air bites with metallic tang, and the few edible things left grow twisted and bitter. But you remember your grandmother’s hands in rich, dark soil, the smell of tomatoes warm from the sun, the weight of a ripe zucchini in your palm. That memory feels like a compass needle trembling toward true north.

You’ve scavenged for weeks, not just for canned rations or clean water, but for *seeds*. Tucked inside a waterlogged library book on heirloom vegetables, sealed in a forgotten pharmacy’s desiccant jar, even traded a precious half-filter for a brittle packet labeled "Moon & Stars Watermelon" from a wary trader who claimed they were "good luck seeds." You guarded them like emeralds.

Now, in the cracked concrete courtyard of what was once a school—its walls scarred by graffiti and time—you kneel. Not in prayer, but in defiance. You scrape away rubble, mix precious salvaged compost with ash and dust, and carve shallow furrows with a rusted spoon. Each seed you press into the earth feels like a whispered secret to the future: *Carrot. Kale. Scarlet runner bean. Sunflower.*

The first night, you sleep with your back against the crumbling wall, a sharpened pipe across your knees, listening to the skittering of feral dogs and the groan of the wind through skeletal buildings. But you also listen for the impossible: the soft, subterranean sigh of life pushing upward.

Days blur. You ration your water, giving half to the patch of earth. You shield the first green sprouts with scavenged plastic sheeting when the acid rains threaten. You talk to them—nonsense, mostly, about the taste of strawberries, about clouds that used to be white.

Then, one grey morning, you see it: a determined curl of green, no bigger than your fingernail, punching through the grime. And beside it, another. And another.

A woman appears at the edge of the courtyard, gaunt and wary, her eyes hollow with hunger. She holds a knife, but her gaze is fixed on your tiny, impossible garden. You don’t reach for your pipe. Instead, you point to the sprouts.

"Carrots," you croak, your voice rough from disuse. "They’ll be sweet."

She stares. Then, slowly, she lowers the knife. She takes a step closer, then another, until she’s kneeling beside you in the dust. She doesn’t speak. She just watches the green, her breath catching like a snare drum in the silence.

The garden won’t feed a city. It might not even survive the week. But in that cracked courtyard, with the ghosts of the old world howling at the edges, you’ve done more than plant seeds. You’ve planted a question, fragile and fierce: *What if we tried to grow something beautiful anyway?*

And for the first time in years, the answer doesn’t feel like a lie.
