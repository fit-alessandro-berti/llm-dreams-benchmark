...a brush made of pure light floating beside it.

As I reach for the brush, the chaotic world around me seems to hold its breath. The shifting geometric clouds and the rivers of liquid sound pause in their motion. I realize that this canvas isn't just a surface for paint; it is a filter for reality.

I dip the brush not into a palette, but into the air itself. I catch a drifting ribbon of velvet purple and a splash of humming neon green. When I touch the brush to the canvas, there is no friction, only a sensation like dipping a finger into cool water.

The colors don't stay flat. They bloom outwards, becoming three-dimensional. I paint a door, and the wood grain forms under my strokes with the scent of cedar. I paint a handle, and it turns to cold brass.

The swirling world behind me begins to collapse, rushing toward the vacuum of the white space. I realize I haven't just painted a picture; I’ve painted an exit.

I turn the handle, open the door I just created, and step through into a room of perfect, silent stillness, leaving the chaos of the dream behind as the door clicks shut.
