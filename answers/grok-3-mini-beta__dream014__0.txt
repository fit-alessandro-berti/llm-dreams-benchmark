You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you accept gratefully, your heart lifting with a mix of relief and curiosity. They are a diverse bunch—an elderly woman with a map etched in her memory, a young artist with paint-stained hands, and a child who seems to know every hidden alleyway. As they guide you through the crowded streets, the city's chaos begins to feel less overwhelming, the honking cars and flashing neon lights transforming into a symphony of possibility.

But in the way of dreams, the scene starts to warp. The strangers' faces shimmer like reflections in a puddle, and the streets twist into impossible angles, leading not to a destination but to a serene park that wasn't on any map. You realize this isn't just about finding your way physically—it's about rediscovering yourself. The strangers smile knowingly, their voices echoing in whispers: "You're never truly lost if you're willing to be found." As the dream fades, you wake with a sense of warmth, the city's buzz lingering as a reminder that help often comes when you least expect it.
