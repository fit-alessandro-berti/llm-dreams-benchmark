...begin to notice the walls are breathing.

The deeper you go, the more the rules seem to shift. A puzzle you just solved rearranges itself behind you, its solution now meaningless. You turn a corner and find yourself facing a door covered in symbols that you somehow know you invented as a child but have never seen before.

When you touch the symbols, they slide under your fingertips like water, and suddenly you're certain—absolutely certain—that you've been solving these puzzles backward. The maze isn't testing whether you can find the way out; it's testing whether you can remember the way *in*.

The air grows thick, honey-slow. Your thoughts feel loud. 

In the distance, you hear someone laughing—or are they crying? It sounds like your own voice, but coming from the center of the maze. Or maybe from the entrance. The directions have become the same thing.

You look down at your hands and realize you're holding the final puzzle piece. You've been holding it the entire time. But now you can't remember what puzzle it belongs to—

—and you have the creeping sensation that *you* might be the puzzle someone else is trying to solve.

The walls lean closer, expectant, waiting for you to understand something that exists just beyond the edge of language.
