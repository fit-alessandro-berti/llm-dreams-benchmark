completely unlike anything you studied for. Instead of formulas or essays, the paper is filled with mysterious symbols and vivid illustrations that seem to move and shift as you glance at them. Confused, you look around the room and realize your classmates are all drawing strange shapes in the air, and the teacher is not a person but a shifting shadow that murmurs riddles. Suddenly, the symbols on your paper begin to glow softly, and you feel an urge to solve them not with logic, but with creativity and intuition. You take a deep breath, close your eyes, and let your mind wander freely, hoping that this unusual test will reveal your true calling.
