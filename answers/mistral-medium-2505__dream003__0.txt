symbols etched into its surface—some resembling ancient runes, others like celestial constellations. The box hums faintly, as if alive, and the air around it shimmers with an otherworldly energy.

Just as you reach out to trace the patterns, a whisper echoes in your mind: *"The key is not outside, but within."* Suddenly, the symbols glow, pulsing in rhythm with your heartbeat. You realize the box isn’t locked by a physical key—it responds to something deeper.

Closing your eyes, you focus on a memory, a feeling, or a forgotten truth. The moment you do, the box clicks open, revealing not treasure or answers, but a mirror—reflecting not your face, but a version of yourself you’ve never seen before. This reflection smiles knowingly, then steps out of the box, leaving you with a single question:

*"Now that you’ve found me, what will you do?"*

The dream lingers, the box empty, the air thick with possibility.
