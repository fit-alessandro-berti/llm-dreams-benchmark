...gratefully accept their offer. As you walk together through the crowded streets, their faces seem to shift and blur—sometimes familiar, sometimes strange. They lead you down a narrow alley that opens into an impossible garden you're certain wasn't there before, suspended somehow between the buildings.

The city sounds fade to a distant hum. One of the strangers gestures toward a fountain in the center, and you realize the water is flowing upward, defying gravity. "Your way is through there," they say, though you're not sure who spoke.

You approach the fountain and see your own reflection, but you're younger—or older—it keeps changing. When you reach out to touch the water, your hand passes through as if it's made of light. The strangers behind you begin to hum a melody you've never heard but somehow know by heart.

You step into the fountain, and instead of getting wet, you're suddenly standing on the roof of the tallest building in the city. The strangers are there too, but now they have wings made of newspaper clippings and old photographs. One of them smiles and says, "You were never lost. You were just remembering how to fly."

You look down at your own arms and realize you have wings too—made of all the maps you've ever followed, all the directions you've ever been given. The city below looks both enormous and impossibly small, and you know exactly where you need to go, even though you can't explain how you know.
