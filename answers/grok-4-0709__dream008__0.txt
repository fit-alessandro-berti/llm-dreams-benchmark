...and you feel a wave of panic rising in your chest, your heart pounding like a drum in a distant parade. The office around you starts to warp—the fluorescent lights flicker and stretch into glowing vines that snake across the ceiling, and your desk morphs into a giant hourglass, sand pouring out at an alarming rate. Your boss, with eyes like swirling black holes, leans in closer, whispering, "Time is of the essence," but his voice echoes as if from the bottom of a well.

Desperate, you grab your computer, but instead of a keyboard, your fingers sink into a pool of liquid code that splashes up like ink from an octopus. You type frantically, and words manifest in the air as floating holograms—deadlines turning into deadlines of actual lines, stretching infinitely into the horizon. Suddenly, you realize you can bend time itself. With a flick of your wrist, the clock on the wall spins backward, and the project assembles itself: reports fly from drawers like birds, charts draw themselves with invisible pens, and data rains down from the ceiling in colorful confetti.

Your boss nods approvingly, but as you hand over the completed work, the entire office dissolves into a vast ocean. You're swimming now, the project a buoyant raft beneath you, and your boss transforms into a giant talking fish, bubbling, "Well done! Promotion to Atlantis!" You laugh, weightless and free, riding waves of relief until a seagull swoops down, pecking at your alarm clock—wait, alarm clock?

BEEP BEEP BEEP. You jolt awake in your bed, tangled in sheets, the dream fading like mist in the morning sun. But as you rub your eyes, you notice a sticky note on your nightstand: "Don't forget the project deadline." Wait, was it all a dream... or is this the real impossible task?
