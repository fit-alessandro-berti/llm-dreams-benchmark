The unfinished sentence hangs in the salt-laden air, heavy with the promise of chaos. You grip the wheel harder, the rough wood biting into your palms as another massive wave crashes over the bow, threatening to tear the tiller from your hands. The deck tilts violently, nearly throwing you off balance. Through the driving rain and stinging spray, you see the crew huddled near the mast, faces pale and wide-eyed in the intermittent flashes of lightning.

The helmsman, young and trembling, shouts over the roar of the wind and thunder, "Captain! The sails are tearing! The rigging's a mess! What do we do?"

You scan the churning grey horizon, the waves like mountains trying to swallow your ship whole. The barometer has plummeted; this is no ordinary squall. The crew looks to you, their fear a palpable thing, mingling with the spray and the scent of ozone.

**You take a deep, ragged breath, tasting salt and danger. Your voice, when it comes, is surprisingly steady, cutting through the storm's fury like a knife.**

"Listen close!" you roar. "Batten down the hatches! Secure anything that moves! Jettison the cargo in the hold – the weight's killing us! Helmsman, point her bow into the wind! We run before it, don't fight it! Reef the mainsail – take in every inch you can! NOW!"

Your orders snap through the chaos. Crewmen scramble, their fear momentarily channelled into purpose. The bosun roars as he lashes down a barrel that broke free. The sails, already shredded in places, are furled tightly, the ship wallowing like a wounded beast in the troughs between the massive waves.

Another colossal wave lifts the stern, threatening to pitch the ship end over end. You brace yourself against the wheel, feeling the timbers groan. "Steady! Hold fast!" you shout, your eyes scanning the crew, willing them to hold on.

**Suddenly, a shout from the crow's nest:** "CAPTAIN! BREAKERS TO LEEWARD! LAND! OR ROCKS!"

Your heart seizes. Land? In this maelstrom? You squint through the curtain of rain, trying to pierce the gloom. Is it a mirage, a trick of the storm? Or is salvation – or doom – truly close?

The ship, battered but holding, drifts inexorably towards the dark silhouette looming through the curtain of rain. The storm rages unabated, the sea a furious, churning monster. The crew clings to lifelines, their faces masks of exhaustion and terror, their eyes fixed on you, their captain, their anchor in this nightmare.

The dream hangs in the balance. The sea roars. The ship labors. The crew waits. The dark shape looms closer. **What do you do?**
