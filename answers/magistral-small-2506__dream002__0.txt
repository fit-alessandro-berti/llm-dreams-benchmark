You brace yourself as the wind howls through the trees, their branches groaning under the sudden force. The air grows thick with tension, the scent of damp earth and ozone sharp in your nose. The sunlight fades, replaced by an eerie, bruised twilight.

Then—lightning cracks the sky like the world splitting open. A deafening **BOOM** follows, shaking the ground beneath your feet. The trees sway violently, leaves and small branches tearing loose in the storm. Rain comes in sheets, cold and relentless, drenching you in seconds.

You stumble forward, squinting through the downpour, when something catches your eye—a faint **glow** between the trees. It flickers like a distant fire, but the storm seems to bend around it, as if the light exists outside the chaos.

Your pulse quickens. Should you run toward it? Or is this the storm’s trick?

(What happens next?)
