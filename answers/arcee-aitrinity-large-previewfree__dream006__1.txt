...feel a rush of adrenaline. Your heart pounds in your chest, and for a moment, your mind goes blank. But then, as you look out at the sea of faces, you notice something unusual—everyone in the audience is wearing a different animal mask. A lion, a giraffe, a panda, and even a unicorn. The absurdity of it all makes you smile, and suddenly, your nerves melt away.

You take a deep breath and begin to speak, but instead of the prepared speech, you find yourself telling a story about a magical forest where animals could talk and humans could understand them. The crowd listens intently, their animal masks adding an otherworldly charm to the scene. As you speak, the stage transforms into a lush, glowing forest, and the audience members start to move like the animals they represent—the lion roars softly, the giraffe stretches its neck, and the unicorn prances in place.

The dream takes an even stranger turn when a talking owl perched on a branch above you interjects with a witty comment, and the audience erupts in laughter. You realize you’re no longer just giving a speech—you’re part of a fantastical performance, and everyone is enjoying it. The dream ends with you bowing to thunderous applause, feeling a sense of joy and accomplishment you’ve never experienced before.
