# The Dream Continues...

...I open my mouth to speak, but no words come out. My boss's face starts to blur and shift—it's not quite their face anymore, it's made of papers and fluorescent light.

I look down at my desk and it's suddenly *massive*, stretching into an impossible distance. The project files are everywhere, but when I try to pick one up, my hands pass right through them like smoke.

My boss is still waiting, but now they're standing on the opposite side of a vast canyon that's opened up in the middle of the office. The deadline is \yesterday\—I can see it written on a clock that's spinning backwards.

Strangely, I'm not panicking. I notice my coffee is still warm beside me. I realize I can *fly* if I just lean back in my chair. Around me, my coworkers are calmly walking on the walls, completely unbothered, as if this is normal.

The project suddenly transforms into something beautiful—a garden made of code and flowers, and I understand, without anyone telling me, that this was always going to be okay.
