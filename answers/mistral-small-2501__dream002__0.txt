As the first few raindrops begin to fall, you quicken your pace, seeking shelter. The once vibrant and lush forest begins to transform. The gentle rustling of leaves turns into a cacophonous symphony as the wind picks up, and the trees sway violently. The sky darkens, and the rain turns into a torrent, soaking you to the bone.

You spot an old, weathered cabin nestled between the trees, its warm, inviting light spilling out from the windows. You dash towards it, your heart pounding in your chest. As you approach the door, you notice strange symbols carved into the wood, glowing faintly in the dim light. You hesitate for a moment, but the storm rages on, and you decide to take your chances.

Pushing the door open, you step inside. The warmth envelops you, and the sound of the storm fades slightly. The cabin is small, with a single room containing a fireplace, a cozy bed, and a table with a single chair. A figure sits by the fire, their back turned to you. They wear a long, dark robe adorned with more of the mysterious symbols.

The figure stands up and turns around. It's an old woman with piercing eyes and a warm smile. "Welcome, traveler," she says in a soothing voice. "You've found shelter from the storm. Come, sit by the fire and warm yourself."

You hesitate for a moment, feeling a mixture of curiosity and unease. But the old woman's smile is comforting, and the fire is inviting. You step closer, and as you sit down, the rain outside turns into a relentless downpour, thunder rumbling ominously. The old woman hands you a steaming mug of something sweet and comforting.

"It's safe to drink," she reassures you. "It will help you rest."

You take a sip, feeling a sense of calm wash over you. The old woman begins to speak, her voice a soft melody. "The storm outside is not just a storm," she says. "It is a reflection of the turmoil within you. But it will pass, as all storms do. You are stronger than you think."

As her words wash over you, the room begins to spin, and you feel yourself drifting into a deeper sleep. The old woman's voice fades, and the storm outside becomes a distant memory. You find yourself in a peaceful, serene meadow, the sun shining brightly, and the world around you feels at peace. The dream continues, but now it is one of tranquility and hope.
