You blink your eyes against the soft glow of early dawn, but the hum of the modern world—no car engines, no distant sirens—has vanished. Every tree, every blade of grass, even the dew clinging to your eyelashes seems drawn from another age. You are no longer in any place you recognize.

As you push yourself to a standing position, you realize you have nothing of your world at all: your phone, your watch, your shoes—even the threadbare T‑shirt you thought you’d slept in—have all been replaced by simple woolen tunics and rough‑hewn leather. You’re barefoot, and your skin prickles with the first chill of morning.  

You take in your surroundings: a shelter woven from branches and animal hides, a campfire’s faint embers still smoldering on a circle of flat stones, and beyond, rolling fields that stretch into dark woodland. Somewhere off to your right, the distant clatter of wooden carts and the lowing of cattle drift on the wind.  

In that instant, it comes into sharp focus:

---

**You need to find water.**

Not for your parched throat alone, but because water is life here. You step toward the trees and hear the gentle murmur of a stream ahead. Each step crunches on twigs and leaves; the forest smells ancient, alive. Your heart hammers with exhilaration and a strange tug of fear—yet the urgency of thirst propels you forward.

Kneeling beside the cool, clear flow of water, you cup your hands and drink, letting the liquid wash away the haze of confusion. As you rise, you notice footprints in the mud—crude impressions of bare feet and of hooves, too. Someone else—or perhaps several someones—has been here recently.

You glance around, realizing that water was only the first need here. The morning sun has climbed noticeably higher already.

**You need shelter that protects against more than the cold.**  

A storm could roll in without warning. Predators might prowl at night. You gather sturdy saplings and drape your extra tunic over a forked branch to fashion a makeshift lean‑to. With each snap of wood against your back, you feel a determination growing inside you—one you haven’t known since you were a child learning to ride a bike. This is survival. This is forging your own path.

---

**You need to learn their language.**

From the edge of the trees comes the distant clang of metal on metal—perhaps a forge? If you can’t speak the tongue of these people, you will be stranded here forever. With a shred of courage, you step onto the beaten path, gathering your new belongings: a length of cord, a sharpened stick, and an empty clay cup you scavenged from the ashes.  

Soon you crest a gentle hill and peer over a wooden palisade, beyond which lies a small hamlet of sun‑bleached cottages and smoke curling from chimneys. Villagers in simple dress move among the stalls: a woman weaving baskets, a child pounding grain, an elderly man sharpening a blade. You realize that to claim your place in this world, you must first understand it.

---

**You need to know why you’ve come here.**

A memory flickers at the edge of your mind—a strange procession of faces, a single word whispered in a language you barely grasped, the sense that this journey was not an accident. As you descend toward the gate, a tall figure draped in a threadbare cloak meets your gaze. In one hand she carries a bronze medallion the shape of a sunburst; in the other, she holds out a rough‑hewn parchment.

Her voice, deep and melodic, speaks a single word you almost recognize:  

> “Welcome.”

And with that single syllable, whatever dream—or destiny—awaits you here begins to unfold.
