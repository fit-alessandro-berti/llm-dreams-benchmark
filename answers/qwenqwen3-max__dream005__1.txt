You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and drift from one cluster to another, each more surreal than the last.

First, you pass a circle of people whispering in a language that sounds like rustling leaves and distant wind chimes. Their eyes flicker like candle flames when you catch their gaze, and they part just enough to let you through—but not before one offers you a paper lantern that glows faintly with your childhood memories inside.

Next, you step into a group gathered around an enormous chessboard laid out on the floor. The pieces are carved from ice and melt slowly as they’re moved. Each player wears a mask of a different season—Winter’s mask drips steadily onto the board. Someone gestures for you to take a turn, but you shake your head and keep walking, the cold seeping into your shoes.

Further on, laughter bubbles up from a trio arguing passionately about whether clouds have souls. One holds a jar filled with stormy gray vapor; another scribbles equations on napkins that instantly combust in their hands. You wonder if your friend would enjoy this debate—but they’re not here.

Then, near a hallway draped in velvet curtains that seem to breathe, you hear your name. Not spoken—but hummed, like a half-remembered lullaby. You follow the sound past rooms where time loops in slow spirals: one filled with dancing mannequins wearing vintage hats, another where guests sip tea that steams in colors not found in the waking world.

Finally, you round a corner and see them—your friend—standing alone by a window that opens onto a starless night sky. But as you hurry toward them, their outline blurs, and their face shifts between everyone you’ve ever known. When you reach out, they dissolve into a flock of origami birds that scatter into the air, leaving only a single folded crane in your palm.

You unfold it. Inside, written in your own handwriting, is a message: *"You were never looking for me. You were looking for yourself."*

And just like that, the party fades—walls folding inward like closing eyes—and you wake up, still holding the warmth of the crane in your dreaming hand.
