You nod decisively, trying to shake off the growing panic. The whitepaper in front of you seems to glow with possiblity. You picture your teammates cheering you on—even though they’re still in their slices of digital life, visible only through the glow of shared screens.  

Instead of panicking, you take a deep breath and whisper: *"Let’s brew this."*

With that, you strain together October rain-soaked keyboards, cat咖啡 cups steaming beside the monitor. There’s no data. No track. Just creativity. And in the space of five minutes, your idea crystallizes.

You present it to your boss—no slides, no pressure marks, only your hands, fingers flying across a cloud-based document, adding… *impossible* elements layer by layer.  

You say: *"Deadline? Sore, boss. But what if the future is this moment?"*  

They pause. Then stand. Walk around the screen. Then, without a word, **clap.**  

The room stills. Then, slowly, your coworkers clap too—digitally, but heard more loudly than ever. And in that instant, the impossible deadline feels like just another sheet of paper.  

You smile. The clock hands, somehow, move backward.  

The dream bends. You step outside the office and into a city made of constellations. The sky pulses in sync with your heartbeat.  

You’re standing atop the digital town hall… and the doors are wide open.  

It’s still a dream. But now, the future isn’t waiting.  

You’re running.  

And you’re ready.
