**Dream Completion:**

As you weave through the bustling crowd, the air hums with fragmented conversations and laughter that fades as soon as you turn toward it. The first group you pass is frozen mid-gesture, their faces blurred like smudged charcoal, their voices a low, staticky murmur. You quicken your pace, but the next cluster hisses as you approach—their eyes hollow, mouths stretched into impossible grins. One reaches out a hand, skeletal and gleaming, but you dart away, heart pounding.  

The hallway ahead elongates, walls breathing faintly, as you spot a flicker of your friend’s coat turning a corner. You follow, only to find yourself in a cavernous ballroom where guests waltz in slow motion, their movements syrup-thick. The chandeliers drip wax that never hits the floor, suspended in midair like amber teardrops. Across the room, your friend’s voice calls your name, but it comes from everywhere at once—a chorus of echoes.  

When you finally reach them, their face shifts like sand, features dissolving into a mask of static. “You’re late,” they whisper, though their lips don’t move. Suddenly, the room falls silent. Every head swivels toward you, unblinking. The floor liquefies, and you sink into a void where shadows hum a familiar song. Just as the darkness swallows you whole, you jolt awake—sheets tangled, the echo of that hum still vibrating in your bones.  

The dream lingers, an unsolved riddle etched behind your eyelids.
