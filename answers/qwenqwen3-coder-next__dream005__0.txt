You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and—  

…a door without a handle, standing slightly ajar in the middle of a sun-drenched garden courtyard. It hums faintly, like a struck tuning fork, and when you peer through the crack, you see not another room, but a **library made of living trees**, their branches forming bookshelves heavy with moss-covered tomes that shift and rustle like sleeping birds. A child in a yellow raincoat sits cross-legged on a root, reading aloud to a fox who wears tiny spectacles and nods along solemnly. You take a step forward—and the door sighs shut, leaving only the scent of petrichor and old paper.

You turn, blinking, and find yourself near a fountain where water doesn’t drip—it *sings*. Each ripple produces a distinct note, weaving into a melody you almost recognize. Three people stand around it, not speaking, but their silhouettes shimmer and change: a astronomer tracing constellations in the water’s surface, a baker shaped like a rising loaf, a dancer whose limbs trail tiny stars. One of them catches your eye and smiles—not with their mouth, but with the *sound* they’re making in the water—and holds out a seashell. You take it, and the shell immediately unfolds into a paper crane that flutters toward the house.

You follow it past a hallway of mirrors—each reflecting not your face, but glimpses of *what you might become*: a musician whose fingers bloom with vines when they play, a librarian whose hair contains galaxies, a firefighter whose helmet glows with trapped auroras. The paper crane lands softly on the shoulder of a tall woman with silver-streaked hair and eyes the color of worn denim. *Your friend.* She turns, surprised, and her smile is warm and real.

“There you are,” she says, her voice layered with the echo of the singing fountain. “I’ve been waiting for the door to open.”

You realize the gathering isn’t random—it’s a *threshold*. Everyone here is half-remembered, half-imagined, parts of a world waiting to be named. She gestures behind her, where the doors to the house have transformed into a curtain of falling light.

“Ready to step inside?” she asks.  
The door to the tree-library hums faintly somewhere deep in your pocket.  

*(What do you say? Or do you reach for the curtain of light instead?)*
