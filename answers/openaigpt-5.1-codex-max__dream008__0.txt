...can't get your fingers to land on the keys. They are gloved in something thick and sticky, like honey, and every time you try to type your keyboard skates away across the desk of its own accord. The monitor flickers to life and it's not the familiar spreadsheet or code editor but a blank white document that stretches out forever when you scroll, as if you are looking into an endless corridor of paper.

The clock on the wall is louder than you've ever heard it. Tick. Tick. Tick. Each tick is a thud in your chest. The red hand is spinning at an obscene speed, making circles like a propeller, counting down a deadline that is somehow both five minutes from now and five days ago. Your boss, who's standing over your shoulder, chewing the inside of his cheek, begins to tap his foot, but the sound is not a tap—it's a drum, a bass drum, reverberating through the floor and up through your chair, rattling your teeth. When you glance up at him, his tie is an endless tape measure, unspooling onto the floor in numbers that race past 12, 13, 14 o'clock.

"Just get it done," he says, voice flattening into a monotone, and you nod and begin to click at the mouse even though it has become a live mouse with whiskers and black eyes looking up at you. It wriggles and escapes, scurries down your leg, and when you stand to catch it, your chair sinks like a cushion into a pool. The carpet becomes water. Cold water creeping up your ankles, then your calves. Your coworkers remain at their desks, their faces glowing from their monitors, oblivious, as you find yourself wading through filing cabinets and floating sticky notes. Someone laughs from across the room and you realize they're all wearing snorkels.

You look back and your boss is gone, replaced by a towering stack of paper dossiers that stretches up to the ceiling. On top of it sits the project file. It's in a language you've never seen. The letters crawl and rearrange themselves, cuneiform shifting into hieroglyphs into algebraic symbols. The impossible deadline is blinking in red at the top of the first page: 00:00. An alarm blares from somewhere—your desk? The fire alarm? Your heartbeat?

You squeeze your eyes shut, trying to remember how to spell your own name, how to click, how to breathe. And in that moment, the fluorescent lights overhead flicker and the ceiling tiles dissolve, revealing a sky full of stars where the air-conditioning ducts used to be. The walls soften and bow out like fabric caught in a wind.

Screw it, you think, suddenly light. If time is melting and the floor is water, then desks can be rafts. You grab the nearest swivel chair, climb onto it as if it were a life preserver, and kick off. The office floats away, cubicles drifting like icebergs. Your boss shrinks into a paperclip and rattles around in an empty coffee mug. You propel yourself with a stack of file folders like paddles toward the glowing EXIT sign, but the EXIT letters reorder themselves into EXTI, TEXI, EXIT again and then into WAKE.

The blaring alarm in your ears resolves into the ring of your real alarm clock. The water recedes. The white document folds into darkness. You open your eyes to your bedroom ceiling.

Your hands are clean. The clock reads 6:45 AM. There is no project on your nightstand. The red hand on the clock is moving at a sane pace. For a moment your heart still drums the impossible deadline, and then the absurdity of trying to type with a living mouse makes you laugh out loud into your pillow, the remnants of the dream receding like the tide.
