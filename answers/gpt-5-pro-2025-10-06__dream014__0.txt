…and you say yes before you can think of a reason not to.

One of them—an older woman in a yellow raincoat even though the sky is dry—hands you a paper napkin and a blunt pencil. “Show us where you’re going,” she says. You stare at the blank square, then draw a crooked line, a river that isn’t there. The lines on the napkin begin to shimmer, then settle into streets and alleys, a sketch of the city you thought you knew. The map is a little wrong in the way dream maps are wrong: it shows thresholds instead of intersections.

The strangers don’t laugh. A bike courier with a scuffed helmet points to a dot you’ve made by accident. “Start here,” he says. “It’s closer than you think.” A librarian with ink on her fingers tucks a folded transit ticket into your palm. “This is your compass. It points to whatever you’ve already loved.” A florist with earth under her nails fastens a blue ribbon around your wrist. “If you forget, tug this. Something will answer.”

You all set off together, your steps falling into an easy rhythm. The city pours around you: brakes sighing at red lights, a bakery door exhaling warm air, steam rising from a grate like an invitation. The courier calls turns without looking, as if following the memory of wind. The librarian reads street names like spells: Orchard, Mercy, Lantern. The florist pauses to straighten a flower bucket outside a bodega, then slips a white carnation into your coat. “For luck,” she says, and you feel braver than luck.

“Tell us three things you love,” the woman in the raincoat says as you wait for the crosswalk. You answer without planning: the smell of tangerine skin, the sound of pages turning, the weight of your own name when someone who cares says it. “Good,” she nods. “Now keep your eyes peeled. The city likes to echo back.”

As you walk, a grocer slices a tangerine; a bright spray of scent hits the air. A busker flips a page of sheet music just as the light changes. A barista calls someone’s name that sounds almost exactly like yours. Each echo nudges you forward. Your napkin-map grows softer with handling, and every time you glance down the mark labeled Start Here has moved a little closer to where your feet are.

You pass windows that reflect you as different people: one with paint on their sleeves, one balancing a sleeping child, one carrying a plant with leaves like hands. You turn to point them out, but the strangers already know. “All true,” the librarian says gently. “Not all at once.”

After a while the crowd thins and the buildings kneel into a neighborhood of stoops and string lights. You stop at a blue door with the number of your birthday, digits in reverse. The ribbon at your wrist warms, as if the city itself were breathing out. “End of the first part,” the courier says, grinning.

You knock. The door opens onto a narrow stairwell that shouldn’t fit inside the building. Up you go, the strangers behind you, the map crackling in your hand like a small fire. On the roof there’s a garden, flat stones and hardy herbs, and a view that gathers the city into a pattern you somehow recognize: the river is a silver thread, the traffic a soft needle. You realize the map on your napkin hasn’t been showing streets at all, but the way your attention stitches them together.

“I don’t know how to get home,” you say, surprised to hear the honesty in your voice.

The woman in the yellow raincoat looks at your ribboned wrist, then out at the lit-up maze. “You are home more often than you think,” she says. “You get there by walking like someone who belongs.”

The florist takes your hand and turns it palm up. The transit ticket has faded to blank, but when you look closer it’s covered in tiny, pale words: names of people who smiled at you today, the corners that smelled like tangerine, the pages you turned. The librarian presses your napkin flat and the lines stop moving. They’ve become what they were trying to be: not directions, but a legend.

When you look back, the strangers are different. Or maybe you’re seeing them clearly for the first time. There is your stubbornness, wearing a helmet. There is your patience, ink-stained and steady. There is your tenderness, dirt under its nails, ready to grow things. There is your courage, bright and unnecessary as a raincoat under clear skies. You laugh, not out of disbelief but relief.

“Thank you,” you say, and the word lands somewhere solid.

They don’t disappear. They just step a little to the side so you can stand where they were. Down on the street, a new echo rises: your name, called by a voice you haven’t heard yet but will. You pocket the napkin, tug the ribbon, and the city answers with a path you can feel more than see.

You take it.

And as you walk, you stop looking for the way and start moving like a person who has one.
