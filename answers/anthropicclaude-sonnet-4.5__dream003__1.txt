...symbols etched into its surface, swirling like water frozen mid-flow. The longer you stare, the more the patterns seem to shift and breathe. Your fingertips trace one of the spirals, and suddenly it feels warm—almost alive.

As you touch different symbols in sequence, following some intuition you didn't know you possessed, the box begins to hum. A soft, blue-green light seeps from the seams where the lid meets the base. The light pools in your palms like liquid, cool and weightless.

The lock doesn't click open—instead, it *dissolves*, the metal flowing away like sand in reverse, revealing the interior. But when you lift the lid, you don't find objects inside. You find a window.

Through it, you see yourself as a child, sitting in a place you'd forgotten—maybe your grandmother's garden, or a schoolyard at dusk, or beneath a particular tree. The child-you looks up, makes direct eye contact, and mouths something you can't quite hear.

You lean closer to understand, and as you do, you realize the box isn't containing something—it's offering a doorway. The question hanging in the dream-air is simple and profound:

*Do you climb through?*

What happens next in your dream?
