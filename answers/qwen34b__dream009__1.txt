You wake up in a village surrounded by towering oak trees and winding cobblestone streets. The air smells of burning wood and roasted meat, and the sky is a pale, golden hue, as though the sun has been filtered through a veil of mist. You look down at your hands—strangely, they are bare, no signs of the tech you were used to. A farmer’s apprentice notices you, eyes wide with curiosity, and offers you a cloth to cover your bare arms. 

As you walk through the village, you realize you can’t understand the language. The townsfolk speak in a sharp, guttural tongue, their words overlapping like a chorus of clanging hammers. You try to mimic their speech, but your attempts are clumsy, and the villagers laugh, calling you a "fossil of the east." 

A young woman with braided hair and a scar on her cheek approaches you, her gaze intense. She says, *"You are not from here. Tell us why you are lost."* You stammer, unable to explain your dream, and she nods, as if she’s heard this tale before. 

She leads you to a cottage where a man in a patched cloak and a beard of silver hair sits by a fire. He’s a smith, he says, and his hands are calloused from years of forging horseshoes and axes. "You need a map," he says, handing you a rolled parchment covered in strange symbols. "But maps are only as good as the one who knows them." 

As you follow the woman through the village, you notice a faint murmur of fear. The villagers speak in hushed tones of the *Shade*, a shadow that moves through the forests at night, stealing the dreams of the sick. You realize you’ve been dreaming of a world where time folds in on itself, and now you’re caught between two eras. 

The woman takes you to a cliffside where the mist rolls in from the sea. She points to the horizon, where the sky seems to shimmer with a faint, otherworldly light. "That’s where you come from," she says. "But to return, you must learn the language of the *Shade*." 

You follow her into the woods, where the trees grow taller and the air grows colder. The woman explains that the *Shade* feeds on forgotten dreams, and to escape it, you must face your own dream in the waking world. You need to find the *Heartstone*, a relic said to lie at the edge of the forest, where the veil between dreams and reality is thinnest. 

As you walk, the forest seems to shift—shadows twist into shapes, and the wind carries whispers of your own mind. You remember fragments of your original dream: a clock tower, a door that didn’t exist, a voice calling your name. The woman says, "The Heartstone is a mirror. It will show you the truth of where you belong." 

You press on, the trees closing in, the mist thickening. The *Shade* grows louder, its voice a chorus of your own thoughts. You feel the weight of your own uncertainty—*what if this is real? What if I never woke up?* 

Finally, you reach a clearing where a stone monolith stands, half-buried in the earth. It’s covered in etchings of clocks, stars, and strange creatures. As you touch it, the world around you shimmers, and you hear your own voice echoing: *"I need to know if I’m real."* 

The monolith pulses, and the mist parts to reveal a door woven from light and shadow. The woman smiles. "Now, you must choose." 

Do you trust the dream, or the world you left behind? The choice is yours.
