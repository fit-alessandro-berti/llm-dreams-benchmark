You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings—a bustling market square of cobblestones and timber-framed buildings, the air thick with the smell of woodsmoke, horse manure, and baking bread—you realize you need to **figure out where—and *when*—you are, before you make a fatal mistake.**

The clothes on your back are strange to you: simple, coarse linen, a tunic and hose that fit as if they were made for someone of your build. The people around you wear similar garments, their speech a thick, melodic dialect you half-understand. A merchant shouts about a "fair price in groats," and a guard in a leather jerkin and a steel cap clanks past, his pike making a hollow sound on the stones.

**Three urgent needs crystalize in your mind:**

1.  **Language & Laws:** You need to speak without revealing your strangeness. You need to know the local customs, the ruling lord or king, the punishments for vagrancy or witchcraft. One wrong word or gesture could land you in a stocks or accused of being a demon.

2.  **Identity & Means:** You need a name, a story, and a way to eat. Are you a lost pilgrim? A traveling craftsman? A mute simpleton? You need a believable trade or skill—something your hands can do. Can you weave? Thatch? Mend leather? Your modern knowledge is a dangerous secret, but perhaps you remember enough basic physics to suggest a better water wheel, or enough botany to identify edible plants... if the opportunity arises without drawing suspicion.

3.  **The "Why":** Most terrifyingly, you need to understand *why* you're here. Is this a literal past? A平行 world? A purgatory? The dream-logic feels solid, the sun warms your skin, the hunger in your gut is real. If it *is* a dream, the stakes still feel absolute. If it's *real*, you are utterly stranded.

You find a wooden bucket by a well. The routine act of drawing water feels like an anchor. as your hands grip the rough rope, a sliver of memory—not your own—surfaces: a rhyme for measuring grain, a song about a saint's day. *Is this implanted? Or am I tapping into the collective unconscious of this time?*

A child stares at you, clutching a hoop and stick. You smile, and your mind races. What do you do next?

**Do you:**
*   Approach the stall selling stew, pointing to your mouth and offering a small, smooth stone from your pocket as "currency" to ask for food and learn the word for it?
*   Seek out the church or temple, hoping sanctuary is a universal concept and a priest might be literate enough to help you decipher your situation?
*   Find the smithy, drawn to the universal language of fire and metal, and offer to help bellows in exchange for information and a meal?

**You need to choose your first move carefully. The dream—or this brutal new reality—is watching.**
