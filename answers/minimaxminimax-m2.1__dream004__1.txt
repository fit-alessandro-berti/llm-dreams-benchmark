# The Canvas in the Shifting World

You approach the canvas slowly, your feet barely making contact with the ground that ripples beneath you like liquid mercury. The canvas floats at eye level, suspended by nothing visible, its pristine white surface somehow untouched by the chaos surrounding it. Everything else here shifts—the sky bleeds from violet to amber, geometric flowers bloom and dissolve in seconds, the trees breathe in expanding and contracting rhythms—but this canvas remains still, a moment of absolute stillness in the madness.

Your reflection doesn't appear on its surface. Instead, when you lean closer, you see something moving beneath the white—not on it, but within it, like images trapped in amber. Faces you've forgotten float there. An afternoon from childhood. The shape of your mother's laughter. A door you walked past every day for ten years without ever noticing. The canvas isn't blank at all. It's simply waiting for you to see what it already contains.

The brush appears in your hand—perhaps it was always there, perhaps it materialized from the changing geometry of the air. It feels heavy and weightless at once, and when you dip it into the air itself, colors follow. Not pigments, but emotions made visible. Grief turns deep indigo. Hope tastes like the moment before sunrise. Memory shimmers in shades you've never named.

As you lift the brush toward the canvas, the entire dream holds its breath.

What will you paint? Or perhaps the question is: what will you discover is already there, waiting to be seen?
