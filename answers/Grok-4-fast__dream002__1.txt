You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air thickens with the scent of rain and something sharper—ozone, like the world's about to spark. The canopy above rustles violently, leaves twisting into frantic whispers, and the ground beneath your feet softens, as if the earth itself is exhaling a sigh of ancient secrets.

You quicken your pace, branches snagging at your sleeves like insistent fingers, but there's no path anymore; the trees have rearranged themselves in the haze. Thunder cracks overhead, not like a whip but a laugh—deep, rumbling, familiar. You spin around, heart pounding, and there it is: a figure emerging from the mist-shrouded trunks. Not a stranger, but you—another you, younger, wilder, with eyes like storm clouds and a grin that splits the lightning.

"Finally caught up," dream-you says, voice echoing like wind through hollows. "You've been running from this weather your whole life." They extend a hand, palm up, and when you take it, the storm doesn't break—it blooms. Rain falls upward, pulling you both skyward in a vortex of emerald leaves and silver droplets. The forest shrinks below, a green heartbeat pulsing in rhythm with your own.

Higher still, the clouds part to reveal not darkness, but a vast, glittering city suspended in the ether—towers of woven starlight, streets paved with forgotten melodies. Dream-you squeezes your hand. "This is where the storms go to dance," they murmur. "Care to join?"

You nod, and as the first notes of an impossible waltz swell around you, the world tilts, blurs, and—

—you wake, tangled in sheets, the patter of real rain against your window like applause. But for a moment, you swear you can still feel the pull of that upward rain, and the echo of your own laughter in the thunder.
