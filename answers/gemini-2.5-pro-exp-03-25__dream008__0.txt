Okay, here we go, slipping deeper into the dream...

...and you reach for your keyboard, but the keys feel soft and yielding, like stale marshmallows. Pressing one makes a faint 'squish' sound, leaving a fingerprint indentation but no letter appears on the screen. The screen itself isn't showing your usual desktop; instead, it displays a swirling vortex of colours, like a tie-dye pattern spinning too fast.

Your boss clears their throat, a sound like rocks grinding together. You look up, and their head seems... further away? No, *larger*. Their eyes are like giant, unblinking clock faces, the second hands sweeping menacingly towards the 12. "Well?" they boom, the sound echoing strangely, as if you're both at the bottom of a well. "Tick-tock!"

You glance frantically back at the project brief. It's not on paper anymore, but etched onto a rapidly melting block of ice sitting on your desk. The title seems to be 'Harmonize the Whispers of Forgotten Socks - Due Yesterday'. Water pools around the marshmallow keyboard.

Panic begins to bubble, cold and fizzy, in your chest. The fluorescent lights overhead flicker, humming a discordant tune that seems vaguely familiar, maybe a commercial jingle played backwards. The carpet beneath your feet starts to feel like damp sand, and you think you see a small crab scuttle out from under the desk next to yours, waving a tiny claw.

You try to stand up, to explain the marshmallow keys, the melting brief, the temporal impossibility, but your chair seems to have glued itself to the sandy floor. Or maybe you've just forgotten how legs work. Your mouth opens, but the only sound that escapes is a faint, bewildered squeak, like a mouse stepping on a squeaky toy.

The clock-eyes on your boss tick louder, faster. The melting ice-brief drips relentlessly, the sock whispers seemingly dissolving into incomprehensible puddles. The crab clicks its claw impatiently. The impossible deadline feels less like a time constraint and more like a physical weight pressing down, threatening to flatten you into the damp, sandy carpet.

And just as you think you might actually *start* trying to remember the forgotten language of socks, you realize with a jolt... you're not wearing any clothes. And neither is your boss. And the crab is now wearing a tiny top hat. The absurdity hits you, not with fear anymore, but with a strange, dreamlike sense of detached amusement... maybe this project isn't so bad after all? Or perhaps... you'll just melt away with the ice...
