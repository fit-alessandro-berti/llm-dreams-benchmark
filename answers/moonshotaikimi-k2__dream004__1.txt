the emptiness before you begins to breathe.  
Every blink of its bare linen inhales a little color from the sky, which tonight is a recursive violet that folds back into itself like an origami night.  

You touch the canvas with two fingers, and the fabric peels open the way a fruit does—slowly, sweetly, with a quiet tearing sound—revealing not the wooden stretcher bars, but a shaft of spiraling stairs descending into cobalt darkness.  

Step. The world tilts. The stairs are soft as butter and just as luminous. Around your ankles, geometric lilies sprout, their petals alternating between squares and circles so quickly that they blur into pixelated perfume.  

Half-way down, a voice like watercolor says your true name—except each syllable is a different color, and the name has more vowels than any alphabet has ever confessed. The colors tug at you: a cerulean “ae” threads your hair; a vermilion “oo” warms your wrists. The lilies melt off your feet into glass slippers that keep changing the radius of their heels, so you feel the cadence of a waltz and a skip at the same time.  

At the bottom is a studio lit only by the idea of candlelight. There, seven versions of you are already painting, each brushing the same canvas from a different hour of your life. The toddler-you slings pure scarlet splashes; the ancient-you lays down galaxies like nail polish on night’s fingernails. All the edges of the paintings melt and join until one vast mural is spreading, swallowing floors and ceilings.  

The canvas you carried now hangs in midair like a membrane between dream and waking. Your future hand drops a last stroke of storm-ink, and suddenly the painting exhales everything it inhaled earlier—violet sky, recursive night, all the vowels of your name—right back into you.  

The colors flood your veins, and for an impossible instant you become the brushstroke instead of the painter: a living streak of whatever tomorrow is made of. Then it ebbs, leaving you clutching a small square postcard of that ever-shifting mural. On it, someone has written in shifting script:  

“Finish me when you wake.”  

You ascend, lighter. At the top step, the buttery stairs fold themselves shut behind you, sealing like a wound healed by memory. The blank canvas you first met now gleams with colors that refuse to stay named.  

You wake holding the postcard. The sky outside your bedroom window tries on the same violet from the dream; for a heartbeat, it fits perfectly.
