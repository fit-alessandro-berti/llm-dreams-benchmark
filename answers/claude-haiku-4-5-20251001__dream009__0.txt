# The Dream Continues...

...find water before nightfall.

Your throat is parched—dust coats your tongue. You're standing in what looks like a medieval village, all thatched roofs and wooden structures. The sun hangs low and golden, painting long shadows across packed earth streets.

You wander between stone cottages, listening. There—the distant sound of running water. You follow it down a slope toward the tree line, where a clear stream cuts through mossy banks.

As you kneel to drink, you notice something odd: your reflection shows you wearing clothes you don't remember putting on. Rough linen. Sturdy wool. And there's a small leather pouch tied at your waist.

When you open it, inside are coins you don't recognize and a worn letter addressed to *you*—in handwriting that's somehow both familiar and impossible. The signature is faded, but it starts with the letter you recognize as your own initial.

The letter begins: \ you're reading this, you've finally arrived. I've been waiting for you to understand. The truth about why you're here is—\

A church bell tolls somewhere in the village behind you, deep and resonant.

What do you do?
