**The Final Challenge**

As the competition nears its climax, you find yourself standing in a vast, surreal arena where the rules of reality seem to bend. The air hums with anticipation, and the crowd—made of shifting, shadowy figures—watches in silence. Before you, a towering door materializes, its surface etched with symbols that pulse like a heartbeat.

A voice echoes in your mind: *"To claim your dream job, you must pass through this door. But be warned—what lies beyond is not what you expect."*

You hesitate. The door’s symbols shift, forming words: *"What is the cost of your ambition?"*

Suddenly, the ground trembles. A figure steps forward—a version of yourself, but older, wearier, their eyes filled with regret. *"Turn back,"* they whisper. *"The prize is a trap."*

But the door’s pull is irresistible. You reach out—

**And wake up.**

Your heart races. Was it a warning? A test? Or just a dream?

Then your phone buzzes. A notification: *"Congratulations! You’ve been selected for the final round of the [Dream Job] competition. Report to the address below."*

Your breath catches. The dream wasn’t just a dream.

**What do you do?**
