**Dream Continuation:**

The weight of the deadline presses down like a physical force—your chest tightens, fingers numb as you hover over the keyboard. The screen flickers, the words *"URGENT: REVAMP ENTIRE SYSTEM BY TOMORROW"* blinking in bold red, though the clock on your desk still reads *3:17 PM*. Your boss leans against your desk, arms crossed, but their face is *wrong*—too smooth, like a mask slipping. Their smile doesn’t reach their eyes, which are now two swirling galaxies, pulling you in.

*"You’ve done it before,"* they say, voice layered with static. *"Just… focus."*

But the project isn’t just impossible—it’s *alive*. The files on your desktop writhe like eels, merging into a single, pulsing document. You open it, and the text rearranges itself into a question:

**"DO YOU WANT TO FINISH THIS, OR DO YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON’T?"**

Your hands move on their own. You start typing—*code, spreadsheets, emails*—but the words dissolve into inkblots, forming shapes: a clock melting into a screaming face, a calendar flipping backward faster than you can count. The office stretches behind you, walls breathing, the coffee machine hissing like a serpent. Your coworkers are gone, replaced by shadowy figures watching from the corners, their mouths sewn shut.

Then—your phone buzzes. A text from an unknown number:

**"YOU HAVE 12 HOURS LEFT. (But time moves differently here.)"**

You look up. The boss is now a towering figure, their suit made of overlapping dead leaves. *"Tick-tock,"* they whisper, and the air hums with the sound of a thousand clocks winding down at once.

You wake up—

—**sweating, heart hammering**—but your laptop is still open, the cursor blinking at an unsent email draft titled *"I QUIT."* The deadline stamp reads *NOW*.

And then you realize:

*You’re still dreaming.*

The screen flickers again. The words rewrite themselves:

**"CHOOSE: RUN. FIGHT. OR LET IT END."**
