The fluorescent lights above flicker erratically as you glance at your desk, now cluttered with holographic task lists that hover like spectral reminders. Your boss’s voice, distorted yet urgent, echoes through the walls: *“The client wants a quantum-entangled client database merged with self-debugging code by tomorrow—midnight. Start now.”*  

You open your laptop, but the screen flashes an error message in crimson: **“DEADLINE VIOLATION: -24 HOURS.”** Your keyboard begins to glow faintly, keys rearranging themselves into symbols you don’t recognize. A clock on the wall ticks backward.  

A colleague materializes beside you, their face half-shadow, half-glowing circuitry. “You need the *algorithm of dreams*,” they whisper, sliding a crumpled sheet of paper toward you. The words on it shift as you read: *“To bend time, first unplug reality.”*  

 sudden, the floor tilts, and the office morphs into a labyrinth of server racks. Your boss’s voice now comes from everywhere: *“Work faster!”* But the code you type now materializes as glowing threads in the air, weaving into a tapestry of possibilities.  

Do you follow the colleague’s cryptic advice, chase the shifting code, or confront your boss—only to realize they’re wearing *your own face*? The clock ticks louder. What do you do next?
