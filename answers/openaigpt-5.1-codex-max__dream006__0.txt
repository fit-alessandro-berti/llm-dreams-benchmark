…speak, or at least you think you do. Your mouth opens but instead of words, a soft stream of shimmering bubbles drifts out and rises toward the rafters. You can feel your tongue moving, shaping syllables that never quite land. The microphone in front of you is warm and throbbing like a small animal in your hands, and when you glance down, your notes have turned into a stack of blank, glowing paper that hums faintly.

A murmur ripples through the audience, but their faces are not disapproving; they are unfamiliar and yet oddly kind, eyes like polished stones reflecting light. Somewhere in the front row a woman with a bird perched on her shoulder smiles encouragingly. You clear your throat, try again, and this time something comes out—it's not your speech, it's a song you don't know you know, and the melody hangs in the air like threads of light.

As you sing, the bubbles burst into tiny blossoms, showering the first few rows with petals that turn into snowflakes before they touch the ground. The stage beneath your feet softens, boards giving way to grass, then to something like a cloud. The hot stage lights cool and become a sky; the curtain behind you unravels into a horizon.

You glance down out of habit, checking if you're appropriately dressed, and you are—no frantic dream nakedness, only a suit that now shimmers like fish scales, changing color as you breathe. The podium has become a tree stump. You laugh, and your laugh is wind, and the audience laughs with you, their heads tilting back, mouths open, releasing small birds that join the ones already circling above.

Someone coughs and it echoes like a bell, ringing all the way up to where the ceiling used to be. In the newfound openness, you see planets hanging like lanterns, tethered by invisible strings. You forget your fear completely; with a child's certainty you step away from the stump and expect to fall, but you don't. The grass-cloud holds you and then lifts you. The audience rises too, seats dissolving into foam. Together, you are all buoyed up by something unseen.

"Do you see it?" you ask, and your voice is finally your voice, steady and clear. Hands reach toward you, and you reach back. Fingers brush, and when they do, you feel heat and comfort, a shared heart beating in the palm.

You realize you never had to have anything prepared. You never needed to persuade or perform. You were always here to feel how light can carry. You let go of the last scrap of paper, and it flutters upward, becoming a white moth. The moth flaps once, twice, and then it is an alarm clock on your bedside table, chattering with its morning insistence.

Your eyes open to sunlight slanting through your curtains. The echo of a thousand kind eyes lingers as you stretch, feeling for a moment that the ceiling might not be there at all. You smile, remembering the way your voice became wind, and swing your legs over the side of the bed, the last of the petals dissolving on your tongue.
