**You are dreaming. Can you complete the following dream?**

You are participating in a competition where the grand prize is your dream job. As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and realize that the final task is not a test of skill, but of empathy.

You are given a single instruction: **"Make a stranger genuinely smile."** No location, no rules, just that.

At first, you panic. How do you measure "genuine"? You walk through a busy city park, scanning faces—people staring at phones, hurrying with tight expressions, lost in thought. You try a compliment, a funny observation. You get polite, thin smiles, quick and transactional. The clock in your mind ticks.

Then you see an elderly man sitting alone on a bench, looking at a weathered photograph. He isn't frowning, just still, as if holding a memory in his hands. You sit beside him, not too close. When he finally glances up, you don’t say anything about the photo. Instead, you ask, "What's the happiest sound you remember?"

He blinks, then his eyes soften. "Rain on a tin roof," he says slowly. "When I was a boy, in my grandmother's house." You listen as he describes the smell of wet earth, the feeling of safety. You ask another question, then another—not about achievements or losses, but about small, sensory joys: the taste of the first tomato from the garden, the weight of a sleeping cat on his lap.

He talks, and you see his posture change. Then, when he mentions teaching his daughter to ride a bike—how she laughed when she finally balanced—his whole face transforms. It isn't a smile for you. It's a smile that rises from within, crinkling his eyes, lifting his cheeks, born entirely from the joy of the memory itself.

You don't say you've completed the task. You just thank him for sharing his stories. As you walk away, you glance back. He's still smiling, now looking at the trees as if seeing them anew.

You return to the judges. They don't ask for proof. One of them simply says, "We observed. Congratulations."

But then you ask, "Was the stranger the man on the bench?"

The head judge shakes her head. "No. The stranger was you. You had to let go of your ambition long enough to connect. The smile you helped create was your own."

You look down at your hands, and only then do you feel the lightness on your face—the lingering, unfiltered smile you hadn't even noticed.

You wake up not with a start, but slowly, the warmth of that smile still touching your lips, and the understanding that the dream was not about winning a job, but about remembering how to be human. And perhaps, that is the real dream job after all.
