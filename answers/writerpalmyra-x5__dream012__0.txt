...feel an unexpected calm settle in your chest as the wind howls like a chorus of forgotten voices. The ship—a tall-masted schooner named *The Marrow*—groans under the weight of each wave, but you realize the storm isn’t trying to destroy you. It’s trying to speak.

Lightning fractures the sky, and in that flash, the sea becomes glass, reflecting not the churn of water, but a vast library—endless shelves, floating books, constellations of ink swirling in the air. Your first mate, a woman with salt-crusted braids and eyes like polished jet, whispers, “They’re memories. This storm eats time.”

You grip the wheel, and it responds—not turning wood, but pulsing like a heart. The crew waits, drenched and wide-eyed. You know now: steer toward the eye, not to escape, but to dive in.

What happens when you reach the center?  
And why does the compass point *into* the sky?
