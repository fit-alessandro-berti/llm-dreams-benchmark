You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and each one pulls you into their bizarre orbit, like moths to a flame in a dream where gravity flips on a whim.

First, there's a cluster of laughing executives in pinstripe suits, sipping neon cocktails that fizz like fireworks. They beckon you over, insisting you join their "deal of the century"—trading stocks in invisible companies that predict lottery numbers from cloud shapes. One hands you a briefcase full of rubber chickens that cluck stock quotes, and suddenly you're negotiating with a man whose tie is a live python.

Slipping away, you weave into a circle of artists daubed in paint that shifts colors with their moods. They're sculpting a giant, breathing statue from recycled dreams—yours included. "Stay!" they plead, dipping your fingers in glowing clay that turns your hands into feathers. You flap awkwardly, rising a few feet before tumbling into the next group.

There, poets with typewriters fused to their palms type haikus directly onto your skin, each syllable itching like stardust. One whispers a verse about lost friends that makes the room spin, and the floor ripples like water, depositing you amid a band of chefs juggling flaming soufflés that taste like forgotten childhood memories.

Finally, through the haze of laughter and smoke, you spot your one familiar face across the ballroom—waving from atop a chandelier made of floating books. But as you dash toward them, the crowd parts to reveal a mirror maze where every reflection is you, multiplied into a thousand versions, each chatting animatedly with ghosts of gatherings yet to come.

You wake with the echo of their voice: "You found me... or did I find you?"
