It seems like the argument is about a significant topic that has been weighing heavily on both of your minds. You take a deep breath, trying to calm yourself down before continuing the conversation. Here's how the dream could unfold:

You: "I understand where you're coming from, but I really believe that [your perspective]. I've thought about it a lot, and I feel like [explain your point of view in detail]. It's important to me because [reasons why it matters to you]."

Your friend listens intently, nodding occasionally. They respond with:

Friend: "I see your point, and I appreciate the effort you've put into this. I understand why you feel this way, but I still believe that [their perspective]. I've been thinking about it too, and I feel like [explain their point of view in detail]. It's important to me because [reasons why it matters to them]."

You both continue to listen and respond to each other's points, trying to find common ground. After a while, you both realize that you're both right in your own ways, and that the disagreement is more about priorities than about right or wrong. You both agree to respect each other's views and to continue discussing the topic in the future.

In the end, you both feel a sense of understanding and respect for each other, even though you may not have reached a complete agreement. You both agree to keep the conversation open and to continue learning from each other.

As the dream fades, you both wake up, smiling at each other, grateful for the opportunity to have this important conversation.
