...storm out of the room, slamming the door behind me. I pace back and forth in the hallway, trying to calm down and collect my thoughts. But as I walk, the hallway starts to morph and change around me. The walls begin to fade away, and I find myself standing in a vast, empty desert landscape.

My friend appears beside me, but we're not arguing anymore. Instead, we're both standing there, looking out at the endless dunes of sand. My friend turns to me and says, "Do you remember that trip we took to the beach when we were kids?" I nod, and suddenly we're transported to a sunny beach, with seagulls flying overhead and waves crashing against the shore.

We're laughing and building sandcastles together, just like we used to when we were younger. But then, the sandcastles start to grow and change, taking on a life of their own. They become towering structures, with turrets and moats, and we find ourselves in the middle of a fantastical, medieval-style battle.

We're both armed with silly string and water balloons, and we're dodging and weaving around each other, trying to outmaneuver our opponent. The battle rages on for what feels like hours, but eventually, we both collapse on the sand, exhausted and giggling.

As we catch our breath, my friend turns to me and says, "I'm sorry I didn't listen to you earlier." I smile and say, "I'm sorry I didn't listen to you either." And just like that, the argument is forgotten, and we're back to being close friends, united and at peace. But then, I wake up, feeling a little disoriented, but also strangely hopeful and renewed.
