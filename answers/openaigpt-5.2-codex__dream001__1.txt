…start to run, your shoes slapping against cobblestones that shimmer like wet glass. The street signs rearrange themselves into languages you almost understand. You pull out your phone for directions, but the screen shows only your own wide eyes; the map blooms in the lines of your palm instead. A passerby with a paper umbrella points up instead of forward, and when you look, the skyline has tilted, a lone clock tower now dangling from the clouds like a pendulum.

You follow it, weaving through markets that sell memories in jars and buses that glide by on rails of mist. The city keeps folding and unfolding around you, each turn taking you both farther and closer. As you cross a bridge, the river below turns into a ribbon of ink and the letters on it spell a single word: *here*.

There, at the base of the clock tower, a glass door opens on its own. Inside is a quiet room with a long table. Only one person sits there, waiting with a calm smile. It’s you. You sit down across from yourself, and before either of you can speak, the clock tower chimes, the sound rippling through the air like a wake.

You blink—and your alarm is ringing.
