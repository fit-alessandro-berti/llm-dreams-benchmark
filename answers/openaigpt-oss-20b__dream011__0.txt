You are dreaming. Can you complete the following dream?

You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are not the cold, dry text you expected. They are… 

… **written in the language of the wind**. The words slide across your page in ribbons of pale silver, each sentence curling and uncurving like the breath of a long‑gone poet. You reach for the first pencil, but instead of graphite you feel a cool mist that tingles at your fingertips. When you press the pencil to the page, a faint humming spreads out, as though the paper itself were singing a lullaby you’ve heard in every childhood memory when your parents whispered goodnight.

The first question blooms on the sheet: *“What is the color of the first thing you remember from your first day of school?”* It is not a multiple‑choice; instead, the words dissolve into a field of tiny, translucent butterflies, each one holding a fragment of a memory. One butterfly flutters to your left, its wings a pale blue that recalls the color of a summer sky. Another lands on your right, shimmering gold, echoing a memory of a golden apple from your grandmother's kitchen. You realize you are no longer answering a question—you are recalling.

As you move to the next problem, the air shifts, and the paper begins to pulse. The second question appears, its edges brightening like sunrise: *“If your future career were a tree, what would its roots be?”* The question itself grows roots that wrap around your desk, then extend through your feet, through the floor, into the earth below your bed. The ground trembles as a thousand roots stir, and each root carries a different path: one leads to science, one to art, one to community service. You find the question is asking you not to choose a path, but to see which one has grown deepest within you, the one that has roots in your earliest loves and fears.

By now you have forgotten that an exam is supposed to be a test. The next question, written in a hand that is both your own and that of someone you admire, says: *“Write the story that will carry you through your career without the need to look at this paper.”* A hand-drawn pencil icon appears beside it, hovering above it like a question mark made from a question mark. A gentle wind blows, and the ink flows into the paper like ink in water, turning the words into an actual story. It begins with your name, the name of a place where the sky was a deeper shade than it is today, and a small boy named you, who dreamed in colors instead of numbers.

The room around you begins to morph. The desks tilt like a giant, slow‑moving carousel, each turning toward a different horizon that glows faintly in the distance. The lights overhead dim to starlight, and the ceiling becomes a dark velvet sky dotted with bright, moving constellations, each constellation a different professional field: the star cluster for medicine pulses softly, the one for literature flares with a gentle blue, the one for entrepreneurship glows with a vibrant orange.

You realize that this is not a test of knowledge at all. It is a test of the map of your soul. Each question, whether written in wind, butterflies, or pulsing roots, is simply a mirror reflecting what you have buried under layers of doubt and expectation.

As the last page turns itself open, the final question appears, the simplest and the most profound: *“Who are you, and who will you become, when no one is watching?”* Below it, a single question mark, but this one is not a question—it is an invitation. You look up, and the air is thick with possibility: your own future, a future that you will build with your hands, heart, and mind.

You close your eyes. The paper dissolves into a flock of silver birds, each bird a feather of the future. In the dream, you feel a gentle tug, a pull back to reality, and the birds form a circle around you, whispering the name of your next great adventure: *Your own story.*
