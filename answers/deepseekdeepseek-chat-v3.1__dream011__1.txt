…written in a language you don't recognize. The symbols on the page seem to shift and swirl, like ink dropped in water. A cold dread washes over you. You flip through the pages frantically—every single question is the same. No math formulas, no historical dates, no essay prompts. Just unfamiliar, flowing script.

The clock on the wall is moving at an alarming speed, the minute hand completing a full circle every few seconds.

The professor, whose face is strangely blurred, catches your eye from the front of the room. He gives you a slow, knowing smile and points to your exam booklet. You look down and the text has finally resolved into words you can understand, but the message is no less terrifying.

It reads, in plain English: "The exam is not about what you know. It's about what you *are*. Begin."

Suddenly, the paper isn't paper anymore. It's your own skin. The desk is gone. The questions are now being asked by a voice inside your head, and you realize you are no longer in a classroom, but standing at a crossroads in a vast, empty landscape under a twilight sky.

The first question echoes, not in the room, but in your soul: "What is the value you will never compromise?"
