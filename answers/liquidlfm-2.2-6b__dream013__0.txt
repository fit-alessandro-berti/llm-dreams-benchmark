...start to realize the maze isn't just physical—it's a reflection of your own mind. Each twist and turn isn't just directional, but representational. The puzzles shift and reshape as you solve (and sometimes invalidate) them, revealing new pathways, and at times, corridors that seem to close in suddenly.

I find myself staring at a mirror-paned wall, and my reflection doesn’t show a face—it shows fragments of stacks of papers, half-solved equations, glowing forken branches of code, and a clock that ticks backward. Instinctively, I reach out and touch the mirror, and the reflection sways as if alive.

Suddenly, the question appears in my mind—not written, but *felt*, like a warm wave in my thoughts.

**“Which puzzle were you meant to solve first, really?”**

Before I can answer, the room around me dissolves into a grid of constellations, each star a different puzzle. One lingers, bright and pulsing—I can almost hear it whispering, **“The first you think is the right one is not.”**

Panic rises, but beneath it, there’s a strange calm. I take a breath, a slow, deliberate breath, and remember:

The real puzzle isn’t in solving them—it’s in choosing *which* to face, and *when*.

And so, stepping into the meadow outside the maze, I feel a hand in mine, cool and open.

“Which will you begin?” it says.

And I smile.  
The journey has just begun.
