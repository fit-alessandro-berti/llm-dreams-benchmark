take a deep breath, feeling the weight of their anticipation. The stage lights are bright, almost blinding, and a faint hum of the microphone fills the silence. As you approach the podium, the faces in the crowd blur into a sea of colors and shapes, but their energy is palpable.  

You open your mouth to begin, but instead of words, a soft, melodic sound escapes—a tune you didn’t know you could sing. The audience leans in, captivated, as the melody grows stronger, weaving through the room like a tangible thread. Suddenly, the stage begins to shift beneath your feet, transforming into a lush, vibrant meadow. The audience fades away, replaced by towering trees and a golden sunset.  

You continue to sing, and the melody attracts a flock of glowing, ethereal birds that circle around you. Their feathers shimmer with colors you’ve never seen before, and their voices harmonize with yours. A sense of peace and connection washes over you, as though you’ve tapped into something ancient and profound.  

The dream shifts again, and you find yourself standing at the edge of a vast, shimmering lake. The birds guide you to the water, where you see your reflection—but it’s not quite you. It’s a version of yourself, radiant and fearless, smiling back with wisdom in its eyes.  

As you wake, the melody lingers in your mind, a reminder of the power within you to create, to inspire, and to transform.
