Okay, the dream continues...

You start to **panic, a cold knot tightening in your stomach.** The city around you is a dizzying mix of architectural styles – towering gothic spires lean against shimmering chrome skyscrapers, cobblestone alleyways twist beside multi-lane highways suspended impossibly in the air. The sky is a strange, bruised purple, even though you feel it should be morning.

First, you frantically check your pockets. No phone. No wallet. No helpful slip of paper with the address. You don't even recognize the clothes you're wearing – they feel slightly too formal, maybe made of a material that rustles like dry leaves.

"Excuse me?" you call out to a passerby. The person turns, but their face is a smooth, featureless oval, like an egg. They don't speak, just tilt their head slightly before drifting away, floating a few inches off the ground. Anxiety spikes. Everyone seems slightly *off*. Some walk backwards, others hum discordant tunes, a few seem to be made partially of smoke.

You glance at a large clock face on a nearby tower. The hands are spinning wildly, sometimes forward, sometimes backward. An hour could be minutes, or seconds. The pressure intensifies.

Okay, think. What *do* you remember about the meeting? A name? A building? A feeling? All you get is a vague impression: something about *'potential'* and the colour *'cerulean'*. Not helpful.

You decide to just pick a direction and *move*. You hurry down a wide boulevard paved with what looks like mother-of-pearl. The buildings seem to watch you, their windows like countless eyes. You hear whispers that sound like your own name, but distorted, echoing from drains and high balconies.

Suddenly, you trip. Not over a crack, but over a distortion in the pavement itself, like a heat haze made solid. You stumble and catch yourself, looking down to see a small, brightly coloured bird pecking at the spot where you nearly fell. It looks up at you with intelligent, ancient eyes and chirps, "Wrong way for cerulean potential. Follow the scent of rain on hot asphalt."

Before you can react, the bird dissolves into a puff of blue glitter. You sniff the air. Amidst the city's strange smells (ozone, burnt sugar, damp wool), you *do* detect a faint, distinct scent of rain hitting hot pavement, even though the sky is clear.

Taking a leap of faith – what else can you do? – you turn and follow the impossible scent, plunging into a narrow side street. The sounds of the main boulevard fade, replaced by the dripping of water and the distant, rhythmic clang of metal on metal. The alley twists sharply, the walls closing in, smelling strongly now of that rain-scent. It feels like you're heading somewhere specific, pulled by an invisible thread. The meeting... maybe... just maybe... you turn another corner, the scent overwhelming, and see a single, plain door ahead, glowing faintly with a soft, cerulean light... The rhythmic clanging stops. Silence, except for the frantic thumping of your own heart. You reach for the doorknob...
