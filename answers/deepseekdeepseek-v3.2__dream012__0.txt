The wheel is slick with salt spray, your knuckles white as you fight to hold course. The ship groans like a living thing, each wave a hammer blow against the hull. Lightning stitches the black sky, illuminating the terrified faces of your crew for a fractured second.

You don't feel like a captain. You feel like a fraud, a boy playing dress-up in your father's oilskins. The fear is a cold stone in your gut. But you look at them—young Evans clinging to the rigging, old Briggs with his broken hand wrapped in a rag—and you know the stone cannot show.

You take a breath, and the wind steals it. You shout, and your voice is raw but it carries, not with the thunder of command, but with a strange, iron calm you didn't know you possessed.

"Briggs! Take the wheel! Hold her steady into the wind, you know the dance!"

The old sailor's eyes meet yours. He sees the fear, and he sees you holding it. He nods, a sharp, professional gesture, and his hands replace yours on the spokes.

"Evans! With me!" You lurch across the heaving deck, grabbing the boy's shoulder. "We're shortening sail. Now. Follow my hands, do as I do."

You lead not from the rear, but from the front, clawing your way up into the screaming chaos of the rigging. The world is a madness of wind and water. You work, hand over hand, your movements becoming a rhythm against the storm's chaos. Evans is beside you, mimicking your motions, his terror channeled into the task.

Below, the crew sees you up there, a dark shape against the fury. They see you working, not just shouting. And they move. They find their posts. They become a crew again.

The storm does not lessen. But the ship begins to answer. It is no longer a cork in a maelstrom; it is a thing being steered, being fought for.

You drop back to the deck, soaked and breathless. Briggs meets your eyes at the wheel, and he gives you the smallest of grim smiles—a craftsman's acknowledgment.

You don't know if you'll make it through the night. But you know, as you stand there with your crew in the heart of the howling dark, that you are their captain. And you are still sailing.
