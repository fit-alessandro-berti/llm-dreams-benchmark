*drifting through the space*

...and the rooms keep shifting. I pass a circle of people laughing at something I just missed, and when I try to join them, I realize they're all speaking a language that sounds familiar but I can't quite understand—like English played slightly backward.

I check my phone to text my friend but the screen shows only my own face looking back, confused.

Then I'm in a kitchen. A woman hands me a drink in a glass that's somehow both empty and full. \They're looking for you too,\ but her mouth doesn't move.

I wander up stairs that take longer than they should. Each floor has a different party—one silent, one too loud, one where everyone wears the same face (kind? menacing? I can't tell). 

Through a window I finally spot my friend outside in a garden that wasn't there before. I wave. They wave back. But when I find a door and step through—

I'm back at the entrance. The gathering has grown. Everyone seems to know each other now except me. Someone touches my shoulder and I turn, certain it's finally them—

*and I feel that vertiginous dream-Loss, the answer dissolving just as it arrives*

Did I capture the texture you were hoping for? Dreams have such strange emotional logic.
