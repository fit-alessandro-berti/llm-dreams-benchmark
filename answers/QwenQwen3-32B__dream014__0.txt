You follow them through winding alleys that shimmer like liquid glass, their laughter harmonizing into a melody that hums in your bones. The city shifts around you—skyscrapers melt into trees with leaves of silver, streetlights bloom into fireflies—until you reach a bridge made of starlight. One stranger hands you a compass with no needle, only a feather that points inward. "Trust the weight of your own heart," they whisper, and fades like mist. The others sing a lullaby in a language you’ve always known, and suddenly, you remember the way home isn’t a place, but a feeling. You step onto the bridge, and it dissolves into doves beneath your feet. When you wake, the city is gone, and you’re lying under a real sky, the first tears of morning washing over you.
