You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you feel a wave of relief wash over you like warm water.

Their faces blur at the edges, the way faces do in dreams—kind eyes, smiling mouths, but no distinct features you could later recall. There are three of them, maybe four; they shift and shimmer like heat mirages on summer pavement. One extends a hand, and without hesitation, you take it. Their skin is warm, impossibly warm, as if they've been standing by a fire just for you.

"Come," they say, and their voice sounds like music from a window you passed long ago, something familiar you can't quite place.

They lead you through streets that twist and turn in impossible ways—alleyways that open into courtyards filled with flowers that shouldn't bloom at the same time, crosswalks that light up in patterns like constellations. The city breathes around you, tall buildings swaying gently as if they're alive, their windows blinking like sleepy eyes.

You walk between them, and for the first time since you arrived in this place, the loneliness loosens its grip on your chest. They ask you questions—soft questions, the kind that don't demand answers but invite them. What are you looking for? What does home feel like in your chest? You realize you don't know, that you've been walking for so long you forgot why you started.

One of them, shorter than the rest, laughs a sound like wind chimes. "That's always the way of it," they say, as if they've heard your thought. "We forget the question somewhere along the path."

They stop at a corner where five streets meet in a perfect star. The sun is setting—or rising, you can't tell which—and the light paints everything in shades of honey and rose. They turn to face you, and finally you can see them clearly: not strangers at all, but versions of people you've loved, faces assembled from memory like a collage. Your grandmother's eyes. Your childhood friend's laugh. A stranger who once held a door for you in the rain.

"We can't take you all the way," one says, and there's no sadness in their voice, only truth. "But we can take you this far."

You want to thank them, want to ask them to stay, but already they're stepping back, dissolving into the golden light like morning fog. Before they disappear entirely, you understand something that feels like waking up: you were never truly lost. You were just walking alone, and sometimes that's enough to make the world feel enormous and indifferent.

The city still hums around you, alive with horns and voices and the distant rhythm of a song someone is playing on a balcony three stories up. But now you walk with a destination in mind—somewhere ahead, down one of those five streets, there is a door you need to find. Not the door to a building, but the door to a version of yourself you've been looking for all along.

You choose a street at random and begin to walk, and for the first time, the city's chaos sounds less like noise and more like a song you almost recognize.
