# The Dream Continues...

...step back and take a breath.

In that moment, the dream-logic shifts. The room around us becomes softer, less defined—walls breathing gently like we're inside something alive. I notice my friend's face isn't angry anymore, just tired. Sad in a way I hadn't seen before.

I decide to *listen* instead of respond.

And something strange happens—their words start coming out as colors instead of sounds. Deep blues and grays at first, then slowly warming to amber and gold. I realize I've been so focused on being *right* that I never actually heard what they were saying underneath.

The argument dissolves, but not because we solved it. It dissolves because the dream decides to show me something else instead: we're standing together looking out at an enormous landscape I've never seen before, but it feels familiar. Behind us, that petty disagreement is still there, smaller now—real, but not the only real thing.

My friend takes my hand, and we don't say anything.

Then I'm starting to wake up, and I can't quite remember what we were fighting about anyway.
