**Quest Solution:**

**1. Identifying the Carved Trees:**  
Upon examining the carvings, the trees are identified as historical apple species (e.g., *Malus domestica* varieties extinct today). Their mature leaves and branching patterns differ from modern apple trees, suggesting the carvings depict a now-outdated cultivar.

**2. Comparing Species:**  
The nearby trees include both modern apple cultivars and ancient species remnants. The carvings specifically match the latter, indicating they were preserved in the forest.

**3. Analyzing the Archway:**  
The stone arch exhibits wear patterns consistent with tooled carving (e.g., straight tools for details). Natural stone erosion is minimal, implying human craftsmanship from a past era.

**4. Contextual Evidence:**  
- **Dendrochronology:** Examining the local old trees reveals ring patterns aligned with historical climate shifts, aligning with the carvings’ age.  
- **Erosion Patterns:** The stream’s watershed shows evidence of a drier past, supporting the idea that apple cultivation thrived then.  
- **Historical Records:** Mnemonic recall of medieval European orchards corroborates the presence of diverse apple species in the region centuries ago.

**5. Conclusion:**  
The carvings are historical markers from the Middle Ages, when apple varieties prevalent today were more common. The archway served as a symbolic or administrative boundary marking a period of climatic favorability for orchard farming. The quest’s answer is affirmed: **the carvings are remnants of an older era, representing a time when the trees depicted were culturally significant and cultivated.** 

**Legacy:** The discovery underscores the transient nature of agricultural practices and the resilience of plant lineages, offering a window into medieval land management and environmental adaptation.
