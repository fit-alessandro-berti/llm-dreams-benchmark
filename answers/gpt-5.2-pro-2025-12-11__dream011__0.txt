…written in a handwriting you recognize as your own, but older—steadier, as if it belongs to you a decade from now.

The first page is normal enough: multiple choice, neat bubbles, a clock ticking too loudly. You exhale, grip your pencil, and read Question 1.

**1. Define what you will do with your life.**

There are four options:

A) *What you told everyone you wanted.*  
B) *What you secretly want.*  
C) *What will make you safe.*  
D) *What will make you proud when no one is watching.*

You glance up, waiting for someone to laugh, but the room is silent. Dozens of other students bend over their papers, scribbling furiously, as if this is ordinary.

You flip to the next page.

**2. Solve for x.**  
Below it is not an equation but a photo of your childhood bedroom. A small, unmistakable x has been stitched into the carpet near the bed, like a treasure map. You can smell the dust and the sun-warmed curtains. The picture shimmers, and you realize it isn’t a photo—it’s a window.

A proctor walks past. Their shoes don’t make a sound. Their face is blurred, as though your mind never bothered to render it. They pause at your desk and tap the paper once with a long finger.

“Show your work,” they whisper, and keep moving.

Your pencil touches the page, and instead of graphite it leaves a thin, dark thread, like ink pulled from a vein. You write *x =* and the thread tightens around your wrist with a gentle tug, as if it’s attached to something in the other room.

The clock on the wall ticks forward and then backward, as if reconsidering.

You turn to Question 3.

**3. List three people you will disappoint. Explain why it is necessary.**

There are lines for answers. Plenty of space. The lines look like they were drawn with a ruler and regret.

You swallow and try to write, but the names that come up first are the easy ones—distant faces, hypothetical arguments. The pencil refuses to move. It hangs there, heavy, until you think of someone you love.

The pencil glides.

Your stomach drops. The thread around your wrist warms, almost affectionate, almost possessive.

You flip ahead, hoping for something technical—something you can calculate your way through. The later pages are worse.

**7. Attach your portfolio.**  
Underneath, a stapled corner of the exam lifts itself and peels back like a eyelid. You see your own memories stacked like papers: first job, first rejection, a long night with a screen glowing, an apology you never sent. Each memory is labeled with a grade in red.

**9. Describe a time you chose comfort over courage.**  
As you read it, your chair transforms into the one from your kitchen. Your knees knock the same drawer. You can hear a distant refrigerator hum. The classroom flickers between the exam hall and your life as if the dream can’t decide which is more real.

Across the aisle, a student looks up at you. Their face sharpens for a moment, and it is you again, but younger—your hair wrong, your eyes too wide, clutching their pencil like it’s a lifeline. Their exam is blank.

They mouth: *What did you put for number one?*

Before you can answer, the proctor returns and drops something onto your desk: a thick envelope sealed with wax.

It has your name on it, written in the same older handwriting.

The instructions at the top of the page change as you watch them.

**Final Question (Mandatory): Open the envelope.**

Your hands shake. The entire room seems to hold its breath; even the clock pauses between ticks. You break the seal.

Inside is a single sheet of paper and a key taped to it.

The paper says:

*This is not an exam. This is a receipt.*

Below, in small print:

*You have already chosen. You are only here to witness the consequences.*

The key is cold. It has a tag on it: **DOOR 4B**.

There is no Door 4B in the exam hall.

Then, softly, you hear it: a knock—somewhere behind you, where the back wall should be. One knock, then two, like someone politely waiting.

You turn, and the wall has a seam.

A door begins to appear, as if drawn in chalk: frame first, then handle, then the faint outline of a number—4B—darkening as though ink is soaking into plaster.

Your classmates keep writing. Pens scratch, pages turn. Nobody looks up. It’s as if you’re the only one who can see the door.

The proctor’s shadow stretches across your desk, long and thin.

“Time,” they say, not loudly, but with the certainty of physics.

You look down at your exam. Every question has changed. The answers you haven’t written have filled themselves in, neatly, in that older handwriting. It’s all there: the path, the job, the city, the sacrifices. A career like a spine running down the page.

At the bottom, in red:

**GRADE: PASSED**

Your throat tightens. A passing grade, a guaranteed future—and the key in your hand, heavy with an alternative.

The knocking comes again, more urgent, as if someone inside has heard you stand.

You hover between your desk and the door, between the life on the paper and the life behind the seam.

You try to remember what you wanted before you wanted to be safe.

The pencil rolls toward the edge of the desk on its own. It stops just before falling, like it’s waiting for your decision.

Your wrist is still wrapped in that dark thread. It leads off the page, across the aisle, and into the chalk door, disappearing under the crack.

You stand.

The chair legs screech loudly—finally, a real sound—and every head in the room lifts at once. Dozens of faces blur into a single, expectant expression.

The proctor smiles without warmth.

“You may leave,” they say, “but you cannot take the exam with you.”

You glance at the paper again, panic flaring. Your future is right there, graded and official. Leaving it feels like stepping off a map.

You take a step toward the door anyway.

The thread around your wrist pulls, not painfully, but insistently, like a child tugging your sleeve.

Your fingers close around the key.

The chalk handle feels real when you touch it. Too real. The seam in the wall breathes cool air against your knuckles, smelling faintly of rain and old books.

Behind you, the proctor speaks softly, almost kindly.

“Whatever is on the other side,” they say, “you will have to write yourself.”

You put the key into the lock.

It turns with a click that echoes in your teeth.

The door opens an inch.

A bright, impossible light spills out—not blinding, but familiar, like the moment right before you make a choice and everything is still possible. In the sliver of space, you glimpse a staircase going down, lined with papers fluttering like leaves, each one blank.

You pull the door wider.

And the exam hall vanishes, as if someone erased it with a single swipe.

You stand at the top of the staircase, holding only the key, your wrist finally free of thread.

From somewhere below, you hear your own voice—older, calmer—calling your name.

You take the first step.

The blank pages brush your arms as you descend.

The clock resumes ticking, but it’s farther away now, muffled, like it’s in another room.

You try to call back, but the air is thick, and the words come out as breath.

Your foot reaches for the next step.

And then—

Your alarm goes off.

It sounds exactly like the exam clock.

For a moment, your hand is still clenched around something cold, and your wrist tingles as if a thread has just been cut.

When you open your palm, it’s empty.

But on your bedside table, your pencil lies perfectly aligned with the edge, as if someone has set it there on purpose.
