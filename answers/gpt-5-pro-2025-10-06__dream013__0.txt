…begin to notice the puzzles are watching you back. The corridors narrow and widen according to your pulse. Lamps blink in prime-number rhythms. When you hesitate, the maze rearranges itself as if hoping to catch you thinking on rails.

A plaque of brushed steel slides out from the wall:

**ALWAYS — SOMETIMES — NEVER**

Three levers, three options. A line of text beneath: *“Choose the rule that fits all rooms.”* You stare until the instruction stops being a command and becomes a pattern. No single rule can govern a place that changes with you. You pull **SOMETIMES**. The floor unlocks with a dry click, as if the maze approves of conditional statements.

In the next chamber, three chests sit beneath a ceiling fan that doesn’t move the air: GOLD, SILVER, WOOD. Three statements are carved above them:

* Gold: **Treasure is not here.**
* Silver: **Gold lies.**
* Wood: **Silver lies.**

*Only one statement is true.* You run the logic quick and quiet: if treasure were in Gold, Gold would be lying, Silver would be telling the truth, Wood would be lying—exactly one true. You lift Gold’s lid and a handful of warm brass keys spill like sunlight. They’re all the wrong size, deliberately. You pocket one anyway.

A staircase descends into a room of mirrors that do not reflect you. They reflect versions of the room two seconds in the future: the candle is blown out, the door is ajar, a rope coil has shifted. A sentence chalked onto the floor says: *“Act so that your reflection tells you what to do.”* You watch a mirror where the door is open, then step toward the handle. Your hand finds it already turning, as if the action in your reflection reached back to teach you the motion. The door opens. You feel your thinking change shape: not forward, not backward, but across.

Down a tight corridor, you enter the Cartographer’s Hall, where maps redraw themselves each time you take a breath. The exit moves with your attention, a skittering light behind your thoughts. A bronze compass sits on a pedestal. It doesn’t point north; it points to your next assumption. You hold the compass in both hands until your lungs slow. The needle settles. You realize the rule here: the shortest path is the one you are willing to hold still for. You stop walking. The hall rotates around you, patient as a safe dial. A seam appears in the far wall where no seam was, and you step through.

Some puzzles pretend to be about numbers or words but fold open to something else. A door knocker shaped like a question mark reads: *“Say the password only if it cannot be heard.”* You try a whisper. Nothing. You try mouthing the word *silence*; the lock tenses, unimpressed. Eventually you do nothing at all—no breath, no thought you can name—and the latch releases with the intimacy of a secret shared perfectly.

There are easier rooms, which you distrust because they smile. A chessboard without pieces. A clock with all its numbers fallen to the six. A riddle that asks who you are when you are not solving riddles. You pass through them quickly, not to be clever but because the maze is starting to feel less like a test and more like an echo chamber where your strategies are the furniture.

You enter a room that smells faintly of rain on dust. The floor is a calendar tiled in months you remember and months you don’t. The only safe squares carry events you forgave yourself for. The rest crumble to powder when you lean your weight on them. You cross slower than you’ve crossed anything. When you reach the other side, you realize your pace wasn’t caution; it was kindness.

Now the puzzles change. They stop asking about logic and start asking about you, only in the grammar of logic.

* A balance scale that levels only when you set down an excuse on one side and a promise on the other.
* A keypad that accepts four digits: the year you learned to be brave instead of safe. The door beeps green when you enter a year you never told anyone mattered.
* A corridor where the lights turn on only if you admit aloud, steadily, *“I do not know what comes next.”*

The maze responds to uncertainty like a flower to weather.

Deeper still, and you’re in a circular chamber with eight doors labeled with verbs: **CALCULATE, COMPARE, REDUCE, EXPLAIN, GUESS, REMEMBER, REFUSE, LISTEN.** In the center is a table with a single cup of water. The inscription around the cup says: *“Choose the door you cannot argue for.”* You test arguments in your head for each verb, stacking them like cards until they collapse. Only one refuses to stay stacked: **LISTEN**. You take the cup, drink, and walk through.

On the other side is a corridor of faint music. The walls hum at the threshold of hearing, resolving into voices that are probably your own memories wearing different clothes. You don’t try to decode them this time. You just keep pace with the rhythm. The floor rises gently, like a question asked in good faith.

A final room—plain and undecorated, almost cruel in its lack of cleverness. In the center, a box the size of a book, wrapped in plain paper. A tag: *“Open only if you agree not to solve.”* This is where you expect a trick: agreeing is a kind of solution; refusing is also a kind of solution. You sit. You set your hands on your knees. The room waits, and that waiting feels like the opposite of being tested.

After a while, the paper loosens on its own. The box opens. Inside is not an answer but a small, hinged mirror that does reflect you, except your face is lit as if by daylight you haven’t reached yet. On the underside of the lid, a sentence in tidy handwriting: *“Center of the maze: a place where the rule is you may leave.”*

You stand, holding the mirror, and the walls start to fold away with the courteous efficiency of a theater set. Corridors collapse into corridors; arrows fold into birds and lift off; the air smells briefly of old books and fresh wind. You follow no path, because there isn’t one anymore; there is only direction, and it feels like wide sky.

You step out—or in, it’s hard to say—onto a quiet field. The maze sits behind you like a closed hand relaxing, smaller now that you’ve seen it open. You’re not sure whether you solved it or it solved you, and the question doesn’t matter. Your pockets are heavy with wrong-sized keys and a bronze compass that points wherever you’re most likely to make a mistake you can learn from.

As the dream thins, you realize the maze wasn’t about finding the exit. It was about how you walked: the moment you chose *sometimes* over *always*, stillness over hurry, listening over argument, not-knowing over certainty. You carry those choices with you the way you carry a tune—hummed under your breath, steadying your steps.

You wake with the impression of cool metal against your fingertips and the faintest sound of doors unclasping somewhere far inside you.
