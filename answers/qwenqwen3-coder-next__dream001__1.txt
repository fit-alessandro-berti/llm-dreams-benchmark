You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to—

…run—not with panicked strides, but with the strange, weightless momentum of dream-logic: feet barely touching the pavement, yet covering blocks in seconds. The city unfolds like a living blueprint—tall buildings shimmering with iridescent glass that shifts color as you pass, streets that loop back on themselves or fold into spirals when you glance away. A neon sign flickers above a café doorway: *Time’s Guesthouse*. You duck inside, hoping for directions.

Inside, the air smells of cinnamon and ozone. An old woman behind the counter is stitching a tear in the shadow of a clock’s hour hand. She looks up, not surprised. “Ah,” she says, voice like pages turning. “You’re late for the *Truth* meeting. But also early.” She slides a brass key across the counter—it hums faintly, warm as sun-warmed stone. “Follow the sound of water clocks and broken promises. The 13th floor doesn’t exist… unless you believe it does.”

You slip the key into your pocket, step back outside—and the city has changed. Now, everything moves in slow motion: raindrops hang like glass beads, birds glide in impossible figure-eights, and the distant chime of a clock sounds *inside your ribcage*. You turn down an alley where the buildings lean toward each other, whispering in languages that feel like half-remembered dreams. There, suspended between two towers, hangs a single escalator—going nowhere, forever.

You step on.

It carries you upward, silent, past windows that show alternate versions of yourself: one writing a manuscript, another flying kites on a rooftop, one sleeping under a bridge, one crowned in starlight. The air grows thinner, sweeter. When the escalator stops, you’re on a landing with no door—just a vast, glass-walled chamber floating in the sky. Inside, a table of twelve chairs surrounds a single, flickering candle. At the head sits a figure wearing a coat made of stitched-together maps. They look up, smile, and say:

*“Took you long enough. We’ve been waiting for the moment you stopped looking for the address.”*

The meeting—and the city—holds its breath.

Will you sit?  
Will you ask why the candle has no flame?  
Or will you reach for the teacup beside your seat… and finally remember: *you* brewed it.

*(The alarm clock chimes. You wake. Your hand is still curled around something warm in your palm—a brass key, faintly glowing.)*
