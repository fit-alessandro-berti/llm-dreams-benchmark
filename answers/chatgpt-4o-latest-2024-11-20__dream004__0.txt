feel an inexplicable urge to touch it. The moment your fingers graze its surface, ripples of shimmering light radiate from your fingertips. The blank canvas begins to absorb the changing colors and shapes from the world around you, pulling them into itself as though it’s alive.

Suddenly, the canvas expands outward, surrounding you, and you find yourself **inside** it. The world you’re in now feels like a painting in motion—brushstrokes swirl around you, forming fleeting scenes. Trees burst into bloom, vanish, and are replaced by cascading waterfalls that flow upward instead of down. The ground beneath your feet feels soft, like it’s made of clouds, yet every step creates a sound like the ringing of delicate chimes.

As you walk, you notice a silver thread weaving through the changing scenes. It gleams with a quiet glow, subtly guiding you forward. Out of curiosity, you grasp the thread and notice that as you pull on it, the chaotic shapes and colors begin to stabilize. A path forms—smooth, golden, and shimmering like sunlight reflecting on water. You follow it.

At the end of the path, you find a door. It’s not just any door—it constantly morphs, alternating between an ornate wooden door, a sparkling crystal entrance, and a simple, glowing rectangle of light. You realize you must decide which version of the door to walk through. Your hand reaches out, but before you touch it, you hear a soft voice behind you say, “Choose wisely. This door leads to the world you desire most.”

You hesitate. What is it that you desire most? You glance back at the swirling, infinite canvas world behind you, then back at the door. Which do you choose? The world you already inhabit—chaotic but beautiful—or the unknown world beyond the ever-changing door?
