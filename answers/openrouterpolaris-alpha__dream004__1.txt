you realize it’s the only still thing in existence.

Everything around you shimmers and mutates: mountains fold into spirals of glass, rivers pour upward in ribbons of neon, trees stretch into prisms that hum a quiet note when the light hits them. But the canvas stays white and quiet, like a held breath.

You’re drawn to it.

Up close, you notice its surface isn’t quite flat. It has depth, like fog or milk or clouds pressed into a frame. You lift your hand—without deciding to—and a color forms on your fingertip, a color you’ve never seen but somehow recognize. It looks like the feeling of remembering a name a second too late. It smells faintly of rain on overheated pavement and sounds like someone saying “it’s okay” and meaning it.

You touch the canvas.

The color sinks in, soft as a sigh. Where your finger traces, a line forms—a horizon. As soon as that line appears, the world behind you pauses, as if waiting its turn. You draw again, and this time shapes emerge not as abstractions but as choices: a doorway, a path, a figure standing far away with their back to you.

You blink, and you are briefly inside the line you just drew, standing on that horizon. You feel a breeze you invented. Then you blink again and you’re back in front of the canvas. The painting has kept what you saw: faint hills, a pale sky that’s your favorite shade of almost-morning.

You understand.

Whatever you paint, you also enter. Whatever you imagine, this world must hold.

You try a small thing: a cup of warm something on a table. On the canvas, the cup appears, steady and real. You are suddenly sitting at that table, hands encircling the cup, warmth moving into you. You taste it: not coffee, not tea—more like every comforting drink you’ve ever had, layered together until it becomes pure reassurance. When you set the cup down, you’re back at the canvas again, the painted cup still there, steam permanently mid-rise.

Around you, the chaos of shifting colors leans closer, restless. It wants definition. It wants to be chosen.

So you begin.

You paint a stone path that doesn’t change. Each stone is the size of your footfalls, arranged in a curve that feels inevitable but kind. As your fingers move, the churning ground beneath your real feet calms, aligning to match the painted path. You take a step. The path is solid.

You paint a sky that remembers staying blue for hours. Above you, the flickering kaleidoscope softens. Clouds form that look like the backs of sleeping animals. A golden light settles over everything, the type of light that makes people talk softer without knowing why.

You paint a tree. Not perfect, not symmetrical. A little too tall, a little too many branches, leaves in several mislabeled shades of green. It appears beside you, its bark textured exactly like the word “home” feels in your mouth. You reach out. It’s real. A leaf falls, and instead of turning into a spinning cube or dissolving into smoke, it simply lands.

From the wild, shifting horizon, something slinks closer: shapes that can’t decide what they are, colors slipping off their outlines. They circle the edges of your new still life, pressing against an invisible boundary.

You realize the blank canvas was never blank. It was waiting. The whole world of flux was waiting too, impatient for a story.

A question forms on your tongue, though you didn’t think of it:

“What do you want to be?”

The landscape answers without words, through a sudden rush of images in your chest: a quiet garden, a city that glows at night without noise, an ocean that’s deep but never cruel, faces that arrive and stay.

So you give it those.

You paint a shoreline; now you can hear the constant, kind-hearted hush of waves. You paint a far-off city of soft-lit windows; now there’s a sense of other lives, gentle and nearby. You paint a small house near the tree; as it appears, you glimpse yourself standing in its doorway, older, unafraid of anything that changes.

You notice there’s one corner of the canvas left untouched.

That small white space looks up at you—or feels like it does—with anticipation.

You hesitate.

You have the quiet, the path, the shelter, the sea, the promise of other people. That last blank space hums with possibility. You understand that whatever you place there will be the anchor, the rule at the center of this world.

You consider painting “control,” but the word tastes wrong. You consider painting “safety” so thick it smothers, but your hand refuses to move.

Instead, with a fingertip trembling in a color like morning breath and new beginnings, you write a simple rule into the corner, in a language made of curves and soft angles:

“Change, but gently.”

The moment you finish the last curve, the letters rise from the canvas and dissolve into the air like pollen. The world inhales them.

Around you, the surreal landscape doesn’t freeze; it relaxes. The sky still drifts, but slowly, like a page turning. The colors still shift, but now they blend instead of break. The mountains don’t fold into themselves anymore; they breathe. The impossible shapes become unusual but kind: stairs that lead to viewpoints, rivers that arc in graceful bridges before returning to the sea.

You feel something loosen in your chest that you didn’t know was tight.

The canvas is no longer blank. It holds the map of a living world, and you are standing both inside it and before it, like the moment between closing your eyes and sleep.

Then you see there’s a second canvas leaning behind the first, perfectly white.

This one is not still. Its surface ripples faintly, like it’s laughing. It doesn’t belong only to you. When you look closely, you see other fingerprints there already—colors you never chose, shapes formed by hands you haven’t met.

You understand that the first canvas was your dream of a gentler world.

The second is the world’s dream of you.

A color rises to your fingers again, waiting.

You wake with the sensation that something—some softer, kinder rule—has followed you back.
