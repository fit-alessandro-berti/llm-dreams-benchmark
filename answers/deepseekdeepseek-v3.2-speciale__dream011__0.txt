The questions are written in an unfamiliar script that seems to dance on the page. Panic begins to set in, but then you remember—this is a dream. With that realization, you take a deep breath and will the words to change. The alien script melts away, replaced by a single question: “What do you really want?” You pick up your pen and start writing, and as you do, a sense of clarity washes over you. You write about your passions, your goals, the life you wish to lead. When you finish, the exam hall fades, and you wake up feeling strangely empowered, ready to take on the real world with newfound purpose.
