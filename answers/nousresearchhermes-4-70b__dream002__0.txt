You hear a distant rumble of thunder, and the once calm breeze picks up, rustling the leaves above you. As you walk further, the sky grows darker, and the cool, crisp air becomes thick with a sense of foreboding. You can feel the energy in the atmosphere, as if the storm itself is alive and watching you.

You break into a sprint, seeking shelter as the first heavy drops of rain begin to fall. The forest, now shrouded in shadows, seems to close in around you as the wind howls through the treetops. Lightning illuminates the sky, casting an eerie glow across the landscape and revealing the twisted forms of the ancient trees that surround you.

Just as the rain begins to pour down in earnest, you spot a small cabin nestled among the undergrowth. Its windows are dark, and its door hangs slightly ajar. With no other options in sight, you make your way towards the shelter, hoping to wait out the storm inside.

As you step inside the cabin, the door slams shut behind you, and you find yourself in complete darkness. The only sound is the relentless pounding of rain on the roof and the occasional crack of thunder. You fumble for a light switch, but as your fingers brush against the wall, you realize there is none.

Cautiously, you take a step forward, and your foot hits something solid. Reaching down, you discover an old lantern resting on the floor. With trembling hands, you try to light it, the match flaring to life and casting a dim, flickering glow across the room.

The cabin is sparsely furnished, with little more than a dusty table and chair in the center. As you place the lantern upon the table, you notice an old book lying open, its pages filled with cryptic symbols and diagrams. You lean in closer to examine the text, trying to decipher its meaning, when suddenly the lantern's flame flickers and dies, plunging the room back into darkness.

The storm outside seems to grow even more intense, and you hear a loud crash somewhere nearby. Your heart races as you fumble for the lantern, desperate to relight it. Just as you find the matchbox, a gust of wind blows through the room, extinguishing your match and sending shivers down your spine.

You decide to brace yourself against the door, waiting for the storm to pass. As you sit there in the darkness, surrounded by the cacophony of the tempest, you can't help but wonder if you'll ever make it out of this eerie little cabin alive.
