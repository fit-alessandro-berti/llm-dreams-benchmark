overhear snippets of their conversations, each stranger discussing topics that seem strangely familiar yet just out of reach. A man in a velvet suit talks about a city that doesn’t exist on any map. A woman with silver rings on every finger describes a language no one remembers how to speak. 

You weave through the crowd, scanning faces, but your friend is nowhere in sight. Instead, you find yourself drawn toward a grand staircase at the center of the hall. Its steps are covered in a deep red carpet, and its banister glows like polished gold. 

Just as you place your foot on the first step, someone taps your shoulder. You turn and see a child—no taller than your waist, wearing an old-fashioned outfit with a pocket watch too large for their small hands. They look up at you and ask, **“Have you forgotten already?”** 

Your stomach tightens. You have no idea what they mean, yet a part of you feels as if you should. The crowd murmurs behind you, their voices merging into a low, humming song. The child holds out the pocket watch. 

**It’s ticking backward.** 

Somewhere in the room, a door creaks open. The air shifts, carrying a scent of rain on pavement, though you know it hasn’t rained. You glance over your shoulder, and the crowd has stopped moving. They are all looking at you. Not speaking. Not blinking. 

Your heart pounds. You don’t remember how you got here, and suddenly, you’re not sure this is a dream at all. 

The child tilts their head. **“Will you go forward, or will you turn back?”** 

What do you do?
