You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak, but no sound comes out. Instead of words, a swarm of golden butterflies escapes your mouth.

The audience doesn't seem surprised. They reach up with gentle hands, catching the butterflies as if they were valuable coins. You try to apologize, but when you open your mouth again, the floor of the stage dissolves into shallow water. You look down and see your reflection, but the face looking back at you isn't yours—it belongs to a childhood friend you haven't seen in twenty years.

Suddenly, you realize you aren't wearing shoes, and the water is rising rapidly, turning from clear to a deep, swirling velvet purple. The spotlight overhead begins to hum, lowering toward you like a heavy, suspended sun. The heat is intense. You try to step back, but your feet have taken root in the wooden planks. You aren't a speaker anymore; you are an old oak tree in the center of a desert, and the audience is a flock of birds roosting in your branches, waiting for the storm.
