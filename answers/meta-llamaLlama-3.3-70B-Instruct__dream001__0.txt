panic and look around frantically for any signs or landmarks that might help me get my bearings. The city seems to stretch on forever in every direction, with towering skyscrapers and neon lights reflecting off the wet pavement. I check my watch and see that I have only 55 minutes left before the meeting, which makes my anxiety spike even higher.

I start to run, my feet pounding the pavement as I weave in and out of pedestrians on the sidewalk. I pass by street performers and vendors, but none of them seem to notice me or be able to help. I spot a taxi cab idling at the curb and rush over to it, hoping to grab a ride. But as I open the door, I realize that the driver is speaking a language I don't understand, and I have no idea how to communicate with him.

I slam the door shut and continue running, my mind racing with thoughts of being late and missing the meeting. I dart into a nearby coffee shop, hoping to find a map or someone who can give me directions. The coffee shop is bustling with people, but I spot a barista who looks like she might be able to help. I rush over to her and try to explain my situation, but she just looks at me confused and says "You mean you don't have a comms device? How do you expect to navigate the city without one?"

I'm taken aback by her response, and I realize that I must have left my comms device at home or lost it somewhere along the way. The barista takes pity on me and hands me a small, foldable map of the city, which I quickly unfold and study. But the map is cryptic and doesn't seem to match the layout of the city around me. I start to feel desperate, realizing that I'm running out of time and have no idea where I'm going...
