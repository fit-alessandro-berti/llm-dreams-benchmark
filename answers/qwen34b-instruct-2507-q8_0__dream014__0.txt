Yes. I'm with you in the dream.

You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city—skyline towers piercing the gray twilight, neon signs flickering like distant hearts, a symphony of honking horns, rushing footsteps, and hushed conversations echoing through crowded streets. You stand on a crosswalk, your coat too heavy, your breath fogging the cold air, and you feel a deep, aching loneliness, as if the city itself has turned its back on you.

Then—out of nowhere—a small group of people stops beside you. Not a show of force, not a demand. Just a quiet, steady presence.  

An older woman in a woven shawl hands you a paper lantern she’s just lit. "The city moves fast," she says softly, her eyes kind but sharp with knowing. "But it doesn’t have to move *through* you. It just has to go around."  

Beside her, a child—no older than ten—holds up a tiny red balloon that floats gently. "I once saw a man lost in a rainstorm," she says, "and I took his umbrella. Not to take it from him, but to give him a moment with someone else's sky."  

A man in a trench coat with a weathered face places a small, hand-carved compass in your palm. "It only points when you stop trying to find where you’re going," he says. "It points to the *feeling* of belonging."  

They don’t tell you the way. They don’t give you directions. Instead, they ask:  
*"What do you feel most deeply right now?"*  

You hesitate—your heart aches, but not for reasons you can name. You think of a childhood garden, a song you didn’t learn, a letter never sent. You whisper, *"I feel like I’ve been walking in circles, but I don’t know where I am or who I am meant to be."*  

The woman smiles. "Ah," she says. "Then the city isn’t your enemy. It’s simply your mirror. And maybe—just maybe—you’re not lost. You’re remembering."  

The child gently releases the balloon. It floats upward, rising through the city’s hum, and for a second, it glows with the same soft light as the lantern. Then it disappears into the sky.  

The man in the coat steps back. "The real path," he says, "is not found. It is *felt*."  

And as you begin to walk—slowly, without destination—the city starts to feel different. The noise isn’t overwhelming anymore. The buildings seem to lean in, not to block, but to offer. A street vendor hands you a cup of warm tea. A blind woman guides you to a bench with a book open on it titled *“How to Be Quiet in a Noisy World.”*  

You realize—you don’t need to find your way. You just need to *be* here, in this moment, with these people, in this city that suddenly feels like home.  

And in that quiet, you begin to laugh. A real, unguarded laugh. The wind stirs. The lights dim slightly. For the first time, you *feel* seen.  

You are no longer lost.  

You are *found*—not by a map, but by the kindness that chooses to meet you in the middle of the storm.  

And in the dream, you realize: the journey wasn’t about getting somewhere. It was about beginning to belong.  

So you walk on. Not knowing where you're going—but knowing you're not alone.  

And when you wake—your breath stills.  

You think: *Maybe I was always in the city. Maybe I just forgot to look.*  

And you smile.  

Because you remember.  
And you choose to keep going.  
Not in search of direction.  
But in service of presence.  

—*End of the dream.* 🌃✨
