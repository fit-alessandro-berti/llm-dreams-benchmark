You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **stop talking and simply listen**.

Suddenly, the room around you begins to dissolve. The sharp angles of the furniture soften into swirling mists of indigo and gold. Your friend's angry expression blurs, not into fear, but into a shifting mask of different faces—some you know, some you don't, all reflecting versions of yourself you forgot long ago.

"We aren't fighting about the choice," your friend says, but their voice now sounds like wind chimes caught in a storm. "We are fighting because the ground beneath us is turning into water."

You look down. The floor has indeed become a translucent, rippling ocean, yet you are standing on it as if it were solid. With every word you speak, colorful koi fish leap from the surface, bursting into sparks of light before vanishing.

"If we keep arguing," your friend whispers, reaching out a hand that transforms into a branch of cherry blossoms, "the dream will collapse before we find the door."

You realize the "important thing" you were arguing about was actually a key, but in this dreamscape, keys don't open locks—they open *memories*. You take their blossom-hand, and together, you step off the water's surface, falling upward into a sky filled with floating libraries where books fly like birds, waiting for you to read the ending you both need.
