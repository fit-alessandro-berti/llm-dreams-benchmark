...symbols etched into its surface—strange, fluid runes that seem to shift when you blink. The metal hums faintly under your fingertips, warm, almost alive. One symbol, shaped like a spiral with a dot at its center, glows softly as you trace it. Suddenly, the patterns rearrange themselves into a sequence that feels familiar—like a melody just out of reach.  

A whisper brushes your ear: *"The lock isn’t for hands, but for memory."*  

You realize—maybe the key was never missing. Maybe you forgot how to remember.  

Do you...  
- Touch the spiral again, focusing on a half-remembered moment from childhood?  
- Speak a name that suddenly surfaces in your mind—one you haven’t thought of in years?  
- Press your palm flat against the box, surrendering to the warmth?  

(What feels right?)
