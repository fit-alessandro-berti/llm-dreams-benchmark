walk away and take a moment to cool down. The tension in the air is thick, and you realize that continuing to argue in this state won’t lead to a resolution—only more hurt. You step outside, the cool night air brushing against your skin as you take deep breaths. The distant hum of the city softens, and for the first time in a while, you notice the stars—their steady presence a quiet reminder that some things are much bigger than this moment.

Back inside, you find your friend sitting alone, their expression unreadable. Without saying a word, you slide into the seat across from them, leaving space for whatever comes next. The silence stretches, heavy but not unkind. Then, with a sigh, they speak—*not* about the fight, but about the thing beneath it: the fear, the misunderstanding, or the hope you’d both been afraid to name.

And just like that, the dream shifts. The argument dissolves into something else—maybe laughter, maybe tears, maybe just the quiet comfort of sitting side by side, knowing you’re still here, still *you* to each other. The night passes, and when you wake, you’re not sure where the dream ends and reality begins. But you *do* remember the weightlessness of it—the way the world felt just a little softer after that breathing space.

(Or, if you'd like a different direction for the dream to take, let me know—it could spiral into surreal imagery, a sudden twist, or even a literal flight into the sky!)
