You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to rally a ragtag band of survivors—scavengers, ex-soldiers, and a sharp-witted mechanic named Jax—into a mobile convoy. Your rig, a hulking armored truck patched together from rusted semis and scrap metal, roars to life on a diet of scavenged biofuel.

The first raid hits a derelict mall overrun by feral dogs and rust-eaters (those biomechanical horrors that dissolve metal on contact). You dodge laser-tripwires left by some long-gone corporate overlords, snag a cache of canned goods and antibiotics, but Jax takes a gash from a dog pack. Back at camp, under a blood-red sunset, you stitch him up by firelight, trading stories of the world before the Flash—the EMP storm that fried everything electronic.

Word spreads of a rumored "Green Haven," a hidden valley with clean water and hydroponic farms, guarded by AI sentinels gone rogue. Your crew votes: push north through rad-storms and raider territories, or hunker down? You choose the road, because in dreams like this, stagnation is just another word for dying slow.

Night falls, and the convoy rolls out, headlights cutting through irradiated fog. Mutated wolves howl in the distance, but you've got a jury-rigged railgun humming on the roof. Jax grins from the turret: "Boss, if we make it, first beers are on me." The engine growls like a beast unchained, carrying you toward whatever twisted paradise awaits—or the nightmare that follows.

*You jolt awake, heart pounding, the echo of the engine still rumbling in your chest. What happens next in the dream?*
