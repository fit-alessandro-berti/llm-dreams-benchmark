find food and shelter to survive. You look down and notice that you're wearing medieval clothing, and you seem to be in the middle of a bustling village. Chickens are clucking, people are shouting, and the smell of freshly baked bread fills the air.

You start to explore the village, looking for any clues as to how you got here and how you can get back to your own time. You see a group of people gathered around a well, and you approach them to ask for help. They look at you suspiciously, but one old woman offers to let you draw water from the well.

As you pull up the bucket, you notice something shiny at the bottom of the well. You tie a rope around your waist and climb down to investigate. When you reach the bottom, you see that it's a golden amulet with an unusual symbol on it. You have a feeling that this amulet might be the key to your predicament.

You climb back up to the village, holding the amulet tightly in your hand. The villagers gasp as you approach, and the old woman who helped you earlier steps forward. She examines the amulet and nods gravely.

"This is the amulet of the timekeepers," she says. "It has the power to send you back to your own time, but only if you can solve the riddle it contains."

The old woman hands you a piece of parchment with a riddle written on it. You read it over, but you can't make sense of it. The villagers gather around you, eager to see if you can solve the riddle and return to your own time.

Do you think you can solve the riddle and get back home? What is the riddle on the parchment?
