wander the streets, feeling a mix of anxiety and curiosity. The city is a labyrinth of towering skyscrapers made of glass that reflect strange, shifting colors, and narrow alleys that seem to twist and turn in impossible ways. The air hums with a low, rhythmic vibration, as if the city itself is alive. People rush past you, their faces blurred and indistinct, speaking in a language you can’t understand, yet somehow, their urgency feels contagious.

You check your pocket and find a crumpled piece of paper with an address scrawled on it in smudged ink: "17 Mirror Lane." There’s no map, no phone, just this cryptic clue. You stop a passerby to ask for directions, but when they turn to face you, their features melt away, leaving a blank, smooth surface where a face should be. They point down a nearby alley before dissolving into a shimmer of light.

With no other choice, you head down the alley. The walls on either side are covered in mirrors, each reflecting a different version of yourself—some younger, some older, some wearing clothes you’ve never owned. One reflection winks at you, and you feel a chill run down your spine. The alley seems to stretch endlessly, but just as panic begins to set in, you spot a rusted sign at the end: "Mirror Lane."

You turn the corner and see a building that looks like it’s made of liquid silver, rippling and flowing as if caught in an invisible current. A clock above the entrance ticks backward, and you realize you only have ten minutes left. You push open the door, and inside, the room is a cavernous void, lit by floating orbs of light. At the center, there’s a long table where shadowy figures sit, their forms flickering like static on a broken screen. One of them gestures for you to take a seat.

As you approach, the chair at the head of the table begins to glow, and a voice echoes in your mind: “You’re late, but you’ve arrived just in time.” You sit down, and the figures turn to you, their flickering forms stabilizing into faces you vaguely recognize—people from your past, maybe even versions of yourself. The meeting begins, but instead of words, thoughts and images flood your mind: memories you’d forgotten, futures you’ve never seen, and a puzzle you didn’t know you were meant to solve.

Just as you start to grasp the purpose of this strange gathering, the room begins to tremble. The orbs of light flicker and dim, and the table cracks down the middle. The voice in your mind whispers urgently, “Find the key before it’s too late.” You look around, desperate for a clue, and notice something glinting under your chair—a small, ornate key made of glass, pulsing with the same shifting colors as the city’s skyscrapers.

You reach for it, but as your fingers close around the key, the ground beneath you gives way. You’re falling through darkness, the city dissolving above you, and the last thing you hear is the voice: “Remember where you started.” You land softly on something cold and smooth, and when you open your eyes, you’re back in the alley of mirrors, holding the key. But now, one of the mirrors is glowing faintly, showing not your reflection, but a door on the other side.

Do you step through the glowing mirror, or do you search for another way out of the alley?
