find a way to navigate this unfamiliar world. The landscape is strange—no tall buildings, no cars, no screens—just open fields, forests, and a sky that seems too wide and blue. In the distance, you spot smoke rising from a cluster of wooden structures. So, you decide to head toward it.

As you approach, you notice the people here dress simply, speak with an old-fashioned language, and live by rhythms tied to the sun and seasons. You realize that survival here depends on trust, knowledge, and soon, your ability to adapt. Whether you arrive here by choice, fate, or mistake, one thing’s clear: you need to learn quickly—and find your place.
