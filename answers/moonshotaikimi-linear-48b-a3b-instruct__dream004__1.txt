You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and...

…without thinking, you reach out and touch it. The canvas is warm, like skin. It pulses gently beneath your fingers, as if it’s not just fabric, but something alive. The moment your hand makes contact, the muted gray of the world around you *irradiates*—a ripple of blinding white bursts outward, swallowing everything.

You step back, blinking. The landscape is gone. You’re standing in a space that’s both infinite and claustrophobic—an endless white void, textured like canvas fibers underfoot. But now, streaks of color are starting to bleed in from the edges of your vision: vermilion, cobalt, gold—*you* are drawing them. With every step you take, new shades bloom like flowers, curling out of the air, dripping from your fingertips.

Shapes begin to form without your intent. A winged triangle watches you from the horizon. A spiral of trees grows from the ground, then shrinks back into nothing. The world is a sketch, and you are the hand.

Somewhere in the distance, a shape begins to *write itself*. Not in words, but in motion—lines of charcoal grief, strokes of oil-paint joy. It writes a story you’ve never lived, but somehow understand.

You reach out to it. The moment your fingers brush the trailing end of the last stroke, the void folds in on itself.

You wake up.

But the canvas is still warm on your palm.
