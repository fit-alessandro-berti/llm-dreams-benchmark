each group seems to pull you in with their own bizarre rhythm. First, there's a cluster of philosophers in tweed jackets, debating the ethics of infinite recursion— "If a dream dreams a dreamer, who wakes whom?" one asks, his pipe smoke curling into fractal patterns that spell out your forgotten grocery list. You nod politely, excusing yourself, but your shoes have turned to licorice, sticking you in place until you chew free, tasting regret and blackstrap molasses.

Wobbling onward, you stumble into a troupe of acrobats who aren't performing but *becoming* their acts: a woman folds herself into an origami crane mid-sentence, her voice fluttering from beak to wing as she whispers stock tips from the future—"Buy low on quantum regret, sell high on parallel selves." Laughter bubbles up like champagne from the floorboards, and for a moment, you join in, juggling invisible orbs that multiply into fireflies, lighting your path. But the one person you seek isn't here; their face flickers in the glow like a half-remembered password.

Deeper in, the crowd thickens into a symphony of misfits: clockwork musicians playing violins strung with spider silk, their melodies unraveling time so that yesterday's awkward hellos loop back as tomorrow's farewells. A group of linguists nearby argues in a language of gestures—thumbs twiddling equations, pinkies tracing constellations—inviting you to translate your loneliness into haiku. You try: *Crowded void, one face / Echoes in the chandelier's / Shattered Morse code.* They applaud with hands that clap in reverse, pulling applause from the future.

Exhaustion tugs like a riptide, and just as you spot a familiar silhouette across the room—*them*, laughing with shadows—you trip over a conversation about the color of thoughts (it's puce, apparently, with a side of existential dread). The floor tilts, the room spins into a carousel of faces blurring into one vast, knowing grin. You reach out, but your hand grasps only air, and the dream dissolves into the soft hum of your alarm, leaving you with a single, sticky question: Was that person ever really there, or just the echo of someone you're still learning to know? 

You wake, heart racing, the taste of licorice lingering on your tongue. Sweet dreams? Or just another layer to peel back?
