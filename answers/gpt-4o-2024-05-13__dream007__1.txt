take a deep breath and try to listen to what your friend is saying. As you focus on their words, the background around you starts to fade away, and suddenly, you're both standing in a beautiful, serene meadow. The air smells like fresh flowers, and there's a gentle breeze that seems to calm both of you.

Your friend looks around, confused but also a bit calmer, and you both start to discuss the issue more rationally. As you talk, butterflies begin to flutter around you, and you notice that with each understanding you reach, the meadow becomes even more vibrant and colorful.

Eventually, you come to a mutual agreement and realize that your friendship is far more important than the argument. At that moment, the meadow transforms into a dazzling, magical forest with glowing trees and sparkling streams. The air is filled with the soothing sounds of nature, and you both feel a deep sense of peace and connection. 

You take a step further into the forest together, exploring this new, enchanted land, feeling grateful for the resolution and the strength of your friendship.
