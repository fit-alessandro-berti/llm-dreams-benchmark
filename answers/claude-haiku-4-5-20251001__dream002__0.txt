# The Dream Continues...

the light filters through the canopy in strange, amber streaks. The wind picks up, but it smells like rain from somewhere far away—not threatening yet, just *coming*.

I start moving deeper into the forest, drawn forward rather than frightened. The trees seem taller than they were, their trunks impossibly wide. My footsteps are silent on the moss.

Then I realize I'm not alone. There's someone—or something—moving parallel to me between the trees. I can't quite see it, but I sense its pace matching mine. We're walking together through the forest without ever really meeting.

The storm's arrival becomes physical—the air pressure changes, and suddenly my clothes are dry, then wet, then dry again, cycling through states. Time feels strange.

I reach a small clearing just as the first real raindrops fall. They're warm. The sky above is split—half dark and roiling, half clear with stars I've never seen before. 

And I'm standing there, understanding something important that I'll forget the moment I wake, thinking: *This is exactly where I'm supposed to be.*
