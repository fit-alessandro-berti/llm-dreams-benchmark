...written in a language you've never seen before, swirling like smoke on the page—letters that twist into faces, whispering secrets only half-remembered from childhood. Your heart races as the proctor, a towering figure with the head of a clock and hands like pendulums, leans in and murmurs, "Time's up already? Or has it just begun?"

Panic surges, but then the first question unfurls: *What color is the shadow of regret?* You stare, pen hovering, and suddenly the desk morphs into a raft adrift on an ink-black sea. Around you, classmates dissolve into schools of fish, their bubbles forming equations you swear you solved in a past life. You scribble wildly—*indigo, edged in forgotten gold*—and the paper ripples, birthing a flock of paper cranes that soar upward, carrying your answer to a ceiling that's now a starry vault.

The second question blooms like a bruise: *If your fears were a symphony, which instrument would conduct the crescendo?* The room spins, walls peeling back to reveal the orchestra of your subconscious—violins screeching with old heartbreaks, drums thundering like parental expectations. You conduct with your pen, waving it like a baton, and the music swells until it shatters the windows, flooding the hall with liquid notes that taste like salt and possibility.

By the third—*Draw the map to the career that chose you*—you're no longer sitting; you're flying, the exam a kite tail trailing behind. The lines you sketch twist into roads of molten silver, leading not to a job, but to a horizon where careers are living gardens, blooming with what-ifs and wild potentials. The proctor nods, its clock-face smiling with too many teeth, and whispers, "You've passed. Wake up, and remember: the real exam is every morning."

You jolt awake, sheets tangled like unanswered questions, the faint echo of cranes fluttering at your window. And just like that, the dream fades—but the map? It lingers, etched in the palm of your hand.
