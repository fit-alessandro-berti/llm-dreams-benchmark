...the air grows colder, and the walls begin to shift—subtly at first, like breath beneath stone. You pause at another puzzle: a circular panel embedded in the wall, studded with rotating rings of ancient symbols. Each ring must align so that the sum of glyphs facing outward matches a number glowing faintly on the ceiling—base-12 arithmetic, but the symbols don't follow any language you've seen.

You solve it after three attempts, and the wall ahead silently retracts—only to reveal not an open passage, but a mirror. Your reflection stares back, calm, composed. Then it blinks. You don't.

Behind you, the path you came from has vanished, replaced by more stone. No sound. Just your breathing—and then, a faint hum, like a piano note held too long. The mirror ripples.

When it clears, your reflection is gone. In its place, a message is written across the glass in frost:  
*“You are not solving the maze. You are remembering it.”*

A sharp pang—like a half-recalled name—darts through your mind. A memory surfaces: a childhood notebook, filled with these same puzzles. You drew them. Designed them. Buried the book under the old oak in your grandmother’s yard after she said, “Some thoughts are too loud for this world.”

The maze shudders. The ground tilts. One wall grinds open, revealing a narrow stair spiraling upward into dim light. At the base of the steps lies a small, weathered notebook—exactly like the one from your memory.

You pick it up. The cover is damp. A single sentence is written inside in your own handwriting, but in a style you haven’t used since you were eight:  
*“The way out is through what you locked away.”*

And then—you hear a child’s voice, echoing from above:  
*“Hurry. We don’t have much time before the dream resets.”*
