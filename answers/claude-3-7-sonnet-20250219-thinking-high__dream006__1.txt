You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to realize you can't remember what your speech is about. Your notes suddenly appear to be written in an unfamiliar language, the symbols shifting and rearranging as you stare at them.

Your heart pounds as you look up at the audience, but now their faces are blurring together. You notice someone familiar in the front row—is that your third-grade teacher? Your old neighbor? Their face keeps changing.

As panic rises, you open your mouth to apologize, but instead, beautiful music flows out. The audience gasps in delight. You're not speaking words but singing in colors that float through the air. The ceiling of the auditorium dissolves into a night sky, stars swirling overhead.

You're now floating slightly above the podium, and surprisingly, this feels completely natural. The audience is applauding, but their clapping sounds like rainfall. You realize you've always known how to give this speech—it was inside you all along.

As you take a bow, the stage beneath your feet transforms into soft grass, and the auditorium walls fall away to reveal an endless meadow stretching to the horizon.
