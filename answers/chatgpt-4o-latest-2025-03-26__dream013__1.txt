You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, you start to notice that the walls are slowly shifting—subtly at first, then more decisively—adapting to your choices and learning from your patterns.  

The air thickens with a hum of ancient energy, as though the maze itself is alive. You answer a riddle etched in glowing runes, and a wall slides open to reveal a chamber bathed in amethyst light. Floating in the center is a rotating cube composed of glass and shadow. When you touch it, your mind floods with images—memories that don’t belong to you: cascading waterfalls on inverted mountains, a clock ticking backward, the whisper of your own name called by many voices at once.  

You step forward because something pulls you now, not just curiosity but a purpose you hadn’t remembered until now—this maze is not a trap. It's a test. A spiral toward something forgotten.  

In each room, the puzzles become more intangible. One is a symphony of light that must be arranged into harmony using your own heartbeat. Another is a mirror that shows not your reflection but your doubts, which you must speak aloud to dissolve them.  

At the center of the maze—though you've long lost any sense of direction—you find a door made of starlight. It asks no question but waits for your hand. As your fingers brush it, a warmth fills your chest. A voice—not from outside, but within—whispers:  

*"You've made it. Now, wake up… and remember."*

And with that, reality flickers, the maze fades, and you awaken in your bed, a trace of light in your palm and the echo of purpose ringing in your bones.
