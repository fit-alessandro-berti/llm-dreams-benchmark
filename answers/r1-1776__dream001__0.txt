You start to frantically check your pockets for a phone, a map, anything—but your fingers close around a crumpled slip of paper with an address written in smudged ink. The street name is unfamiliar, but a neon sign across the alley flickers it back at you: **"Acheron Boulevard."** The city pulses around you, skyscrapers tilting like dominos, their windows reflecting a sky that’s neither day nor night. 

You break into a run, but the sidewalks serpentine, stretching and contracting. A clocktower chimes, its hands spinning backward. Strangers pass in blurred clusters, their faces pixelated, voices dissolving into static when you beg for directions. A shopfront glows ahead, its display a grid of vintage televisions, each screen showing *you*—lost, late, sweating through a dozen alternate versions of this moment. 

A stray cat darts into your path, its eyes glowing like twin moons. It leads you down a stairwell plastered with flyers that all read **"MEETING CANCELED"** in bold red letters—but when you blink, the text shifts to **"YOU’RE ALREADY HERE."** The stairs bottom out into a cavernous subway station, where a train idles, its doors gaping. Inside, the seats are filled with faceless suited figures, briefcases open, spilling out fireflies. 

The cat vanishes. The train lurches into motion, and through the window, the tunnel walls melt into a kaleidoscope of memories: your first job interview, a childhood classroom, a door you’ve never dared to open. The PA system crackles: *“Next stop: Apophenia Square.”* 

You stumble onto the platform, where a clock counts down from 00:60. The address on the paper now matches a towering black building ahead, its entrance a maw of shadows. As you step inside, the walls breathe. The elevator doors close, and your reflection ages, decays, rejuvenates—a loop. 

The doors open. The meeting room is a glass dome under a swirling galaxy. At the table sit seven versions of yourself, each holding a dossier labeled *"What You’ve Avoided."* The oldest you steeples their fingers. **“Shall we begin?”** 

You jolt awake. The alarm screams. Your pillow is damp. Somewhere, a cat yowls.
