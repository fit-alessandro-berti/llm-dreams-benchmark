suddenly you feel a brush in your hand. Instinctively, you dip the brush into the nearest shimmering pool of ever-shifting paint. As the bristles touch the canvas, colors burst forth like fireworks, creating patterns and images that seem to pulse with life.

Almost without conscious thought, you begin to paint. A vibrant forest emerges, its trees morphing into fantastical creatures with every stroke. As you step back to admire your work, you notice these creatures start to move—stepping out of the canvas and coming to life before your eyes.

One of the creatures, a majestic deer with wings of iridescent feathers, approaches you. It bows its head gently, inviting you to climb onto its back. With a mixture of excitement and trepidation, you accept the invitation, and as you mount, the deer launches into the air.

Soaring above the landscape, you see more blank canvases scattered across the ground below, each one a portal to a new world waiting to be created. The feeling of boundless potential fills you, as if you hold the power of creation itself.

Suddenly, you feel a tingling sensation as the world around you begins to blur and dissolve. The deer, the canvases, all the colors and shapes start to merge into a dazzling swirl. It’s then you realize—this dream is an endless palette, a boundless canvas, and you are both the dreamer and the artist.
