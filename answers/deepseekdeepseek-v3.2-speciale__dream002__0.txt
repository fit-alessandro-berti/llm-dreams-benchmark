You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the wind starts to howl, whipping the leaves into a frenzy. The sky darkens ominously, and a bolt of lightning cracks open the heavens. In the brilliant flash, you glimpse a magnificent stag with antlers that spark with electricity. Its eyes meet yours, and it turns, bounding away. Without thinking, you give chase, your feet barely touching the ground. The forest blurs around you, and you find yourself at the edge of a cliff. The stag leaps into the abyss, and you follow, plunging into the storm. But instead of falling, you soar on the wind, riding the tempest with wild joy. Just as the first raindrops hit your face, you wake, your heart pounding with the thrill of the dream.
