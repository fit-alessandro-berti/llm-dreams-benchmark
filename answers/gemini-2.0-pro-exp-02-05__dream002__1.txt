You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and **the air, previously still and warm with the scent of pine, grows thick and heavy, carrying the metallic tang of ozone. The sunlight, dappled and playful just moments before, is swallowed by a rapidly darkening canopy. Leaves, once a vibrant, soothing green, become agitated, swirling and rustling in a rising wind that whips through the trees, turning their gentle sway into a frantic dance.

I look up. The sky, previously a serene canvas of blue, is now a bruised purple-grey, churning with clouds that resemble giant, angry fists. A low rumble, like a distant giant groaning, echoes through the woods, growing louder and more insistent with each passing second. My peaceful stroll has morphed into a desperate search for shelter. I scan the immediate surroundings - dense undergrowth, tall, swaying trees that feel more menacing than protective, and... is that a cave?

Half-hidden behind a curtain of ivy and gnarled roots, a dark opening in the hillside beckons. It's small, barely large enough to crouch in, but it's the only option I see. The first fat raindrops begin to fall, cold and heavy, splattering on the leaves around me. The rumble turns to a full-throated roar as the sky cracks open, unleashing a blinding flash of lightning that illuminates the forest in a stark, skeletal light, followed instantly by a deafening clap of thunder that seems to shake the very ground I stand on.

I scramble towards the cave mouth, pushing aside the thick vegetation, the earthy scent of damp soil and decaying leaves filling my nostrils. I dive inside just as the heavens truly unleash their fury, a torrential downpour instantly turning the forest floor into a muddy stream. Huddled within the cramped space, I can feel the cool, damp stone against my back, the air inside thick with the smell of ancient earth and something else… something faintly metallic, almost… *blood*? My heart pounds a frantic rhythm against my ribs, a counterpoint to the raging storm outside. Is it the storm I fear, or something else lurking in the darkness with me?**
