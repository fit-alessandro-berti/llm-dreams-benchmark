...decide to take a breath and step outside for a moment. The argument had been building for weeks—about a shared inheritance, a complicated legacy tied to a family cottage by the sea. We both wanted it, but each of us needed it for different reasons: me for stability, my friend for memories. The words had turned sharp, accusations flying like thrown stones.

So I walked out into the garden, the late afternoon sun painting everything in gold and shadow. The air was thick with the scent of lavender and damp earth. And then, without warning, the garden *changed*. The hedges grew taller, twisting into arches that soared into the sky like cathedral pillars. The grass shimmered with tiny, glowing fireflies—except they weren’t fireflies. They were tiny, glowing letters, forming words as they floated: *“This isn’t about the cottage. This is about whether you still see me.”*

I froze.

And from behind me, my friend stepped out, not angry anymore, but holding a small, battered notebook—our childhood diary. The one we used to write secrets, dreams, promises. She opened it to a page where, in faded pencil, we’d written: *"Future you: don’t let the world break us."*

She looked at me, eyes soft. “I just... I was afraid I’d lose you,” she whispered. “Not the cottage. You.”

In that moment, the dream dissolved—not into silence, but into something deeper. Not resolution, but understanding. I reached out. She took my hand.

And the garden remained, breathing, waiting.

We didn’t fix everything. But we remembered who we were—before the arguments, before the past. Before we stopped hearing each other.

And somehow, that was enough.
