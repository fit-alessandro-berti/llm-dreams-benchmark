...panic, your heart racing as you glance around the chaotic streets. The city is a labyrinth of towering skyscrapers, neon signs flickering in languages you don’t understand, and people rushing past you in every direction. You reach into your pocket, hoping for a map or your phone, but all you find is a crumpled piece of paper with a single word scrawled on it: *Eclipse*. 

You try to ask for directions, but no one seems to understand you. The words you speak are unfamiliar even to yourself, as if you’re speaking a language you’ve never learned. The clock is ticking, and the sense of urgency grows heavier with every passing second. 

Then, you notice a small, glowing symbol etched into the pavement—a crescent moon intertwined with a sun. It feels like a sign. You follow the symbols, which appear sporadically along the sidewalks, leading you deeper into the city. The air grows colder, and the sky above darkens unnaturally, as if the city itself is bending to your journey. 

Finally, you arrive at a massive, ancient building with a grand archway. Above it, the word *Eclipse* is carved into the stone. You step inside and are greeted by an empty, echoing hall. A clock on the wall strikes the hour, and you hear footsteps approaching. A figure emerges from the shadows, but before you can see their face, the dream begins to dissolve, leaving you with a lingering sense of both dread and anticipation.
