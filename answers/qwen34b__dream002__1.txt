As the storm approaches, the forest seems to shift around you, as though the trees themselves are bending toward the darkening sky. The air grows thick with a metallic tang, and the once-lush green of the foliage turns to a sickly gray. The wind howls like a chorus of forgotten voices, tearing through the canopy with a force that seems to vibrate in your bones. Lightning splits the sky, and for a moment, the world is lit by an otherworldly glow—your silhouette flickers in the storm’s eye, as if the heavens themselves are watching.  

You run, but the ground seems to stretch endlessly, the path winding through thorny brambles that twist into grotesque shapes. The trees, once silent, now whisper in a language that hums at the edge of your mind—memories you’ve long forgotten: a childhood spent chasing shadows, a promise broken, a name you’ve buried. The storm grows fiercer, and with it, the trees begin to *move*. Their roots rise like serpents from the earth, their branches curling into formations that resemble faces, hands, and figures you’ve never seen but feel you’ve known.  

A thunderclap echoes, and the sky ruptures. Rain lashes your face, but it’s not just water—it’s *tears*, or maybe the tears of the forest itself, streaming down from the heavens in a deluge that blurs the line between sky and earth. You realize you’re not alone. The storm is alive, and it’s *you*. The wind carries your own voice, fragmented and echoing, as if the storm is a part of you, a manifestation of your unspoken fears.  

Then, in the heart of the storm, you see it: a glimmering path of light through the chaos, winding toward a clearing where a tree stands, its trunk gnarled and its branches reaching skyward like arms. The tree is *you*—your reflection, but older, taller, and etched with symbols you don’t recognize. As you step closer, the storm around you quiets, and the lightning reveals a truth: the forest is a mirror, and the storm is your own soul, unmoored and searching.  

You touch the tree, and the world dissolves. When you open your eyes, you’re back in your bedroom, the storm long gone. But the air smells of rain, and on your wrist, a single leaf from the forest glows faintly in the dim light. You remember nothing of the trees, the lightning, or the path—but you feel the storm in your chest, a whisper of something vast, waiting to be named.
