You awake in a completely different era, with no modern technology a tangible reality buzzing in the edges of sensation. The air is thicker – redolent with pine and wet earth and something vaguely floral and intoxicating. I blink, a gritty rain plastering my eyelashes open, and see rough-hewed walls of grey-colored stone rising around me. Chickens squawk in a dusty pen beyond the window, and a woman is stirring embers at a clay hearth. Everything has a rustic, worn beauty, a simplicity I hadn’t tasted before. 

Panic flutters initially, a frantic pulse drumming behind my ribs. Then, recognizing the stillness of the faces around me – a mix of curiosity and polite indifference – I take a shaky inhale.  I realize I need to… **understand the language they speak. Or, at very the least, mimic their movements with the hope that genuine exchange becomes more possible."**

My mouth suddenly feels useless, dry and unco-operative. I spot a man, likely the landlord judging by the concerned furrow in his brow, meticulously hammering a leather pouch onto a saddle of a horse in a stable. I start to mimic him, awkwardly mimicking the rhythm of the hammer, my hands stiff and unfamiliar with simple acts. It’s a clumsy, desperate attempt – a prayer dressed in the guise of action, hoping to build some basic bridge across this chasm of time and incomprehension.  Even if I don't understand their words, maybe shared labor—shared purpose—would lead me toward connection, towards safety, and ultimately, a beginning in this bewildering, beautiful past.
