You realize you need to find a way back home.

The air is thick with the smell of wood smoke and unfamiliar spices, and the sky is a different shade of blue—deeper, as if the atmosphere itself were older. You stand in a narrow, cobblestone lane flanked by low, stucco houses with terracotta roofs. A marketplace bustles nearby: merchants hawk goods in a language you don’t recognize, the cadence of their voices rising and falling like music. The sun is beginning to dip behind a distant mountain range, casting long shadows across the narrow streets.

Your stomach tightens. The last thing you remember is the hum of your phone, the glow of a screen in a dim room, and then—nothing. Now, the only technology you see is a blacksmith’s forge, a hand‑cranked water wheel turning slowly in a river that flows past the town, and a few crude lanterns hanging from iron hooks.

You take a tentative step forward, and an elderly woman with a weathered face glances up from her stall of woven baskets. She offers a small, curious smile, but her eyes are guarded. You realize you don’t speak the language, and even if you did, you have no money, no identification, and no idea where—or *when*—you are.

The realization crashes over you: you need to figure out three things, and quickly:

1. **Survival** – Find food, clean water, and shelter before nightfall. The temperature is dropping, and the wind carries a chill that hints at the coming dusk. You spot a communal well at the edge of the market and a small bakery where a young boy is pulling fresh loaves from a stone oven. Perhaps you can trade something—maybe a piece of clothing, or perhaps offer to help with a simple task—in exchange for a bite to eat.

2. **Orientation** – Determine the era and location. The architecture, the clothing, the currency (small bronze coins stamped with an unfamiliar insignia) all suggest a pre‑Industrial, perhaps medieval or early Renaissance setting. If you can locate a map, a scribe, or a scholar, you might learn whether you’ve been thrust into a neighboring kingdom, a distant province, or an entirely different continent.

3. **A Way Home** – The most pressing, almost desperate need: find a method, however improbable, to return to your own time. In the stories you’ve read, there are usually clues—celestial events, ancient relics, or hidden portals. You scan the horizon for any sign of a stone circle, a glowing artifact, or a temple with peculiar glyphs. The market’s chatter fades into a low murmur as you notice a tattered scroll tucked under a merchant’s table, its edges frayed, its ink still legible. It bears a sketch of a luminous archway surrounded by stars, and a phrase you can almost decipher: *“When the twin suns meet the horizon, the veil thins.”*

Your heart races. You fold the scroll carefully, tuck it into your belt, and turn back toward the market. The baker, a stout man with flour dusted on his forearms, watches you with a mixture of suspicion and curiosity.

You approach him, mime the act of eating, and point to the bread. He raises an eyebrow, then chuckles, slicing a warm loaf and handing it to you. You take a bite, the crust cracking beneath your teeth, the taste both foreign and comforting. It’s a small victory, but it reminds you that even in this strange world, simple exchanges can forge connections.

As night falls, you secure a spot near the well, using a coarse blanket you bartered from the old woman for a handful of copper coins you found in your pocket. The stars emerge—more brilliant than you’ve ever seen, a dense river of light spilling across the sky. You recall the scroll’s mention of twin suns; perhaps this world has a different celestial configuration, a binary sunrise that occurs only on certain days.

You close your eyes, listening to the distant hum of the river and the soft murmur of the town settling into sleep. Tomorrow, you will:

- Seek out a scholar or a priest who might be able to read the scroll and explain the “twin suns” phenomenon.
- Explore the surrounding countryside for any ancient ruins or standing stones that could serve as a portal.
- Learn enough of the local language to ask about any legends of travelers who vanished and later returned.

The dream is far from over; it’s only just beginning. And as the night deepens, a faint, almost imperceptible pulse seems to emanate from the scroll in your belt—a reminder that the way home may be closer than you think.
