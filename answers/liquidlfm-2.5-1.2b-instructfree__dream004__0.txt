...a gift left there, cracked open like an mirror. Curiosity flickers in your eyes, sparking the colors before them—their hues shifting like breath on glass, dancing with impossible rhythm. The shapes swirl and coalesce, transforming the canvas into a living portrait of memories I can't quite recall.

You reach out, and a gentle voice whispers in your mind: *“You’re not meant to touch this.”* Fear flickers, but it’s quickly overshadowed by a sense of wonder. Before you can react, part of the canvas slips your fingers, forming words on its surface—words that aren’t in any language you know, yet feel deeply familiar.

And then, suddenly, you understand. The colors are not random—they’re absorbing your emotions, reflecting the stories you’ve never told to yourself. The shapes begin to hide as faces appear, each one a version of someone you loved or someone you’ve never met.

You step closer, and the world shifts again. The canvas becomes a tapestry of your past, your present, and your dreams. Time bends here, and you finally see the truth: you are the story being written. And the blank canvas? It’s waiting for you to write your own story.
