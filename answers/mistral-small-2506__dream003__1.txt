symbols etched into its surface—some resembling ancient constellations, others like strange, looping scripts you’ve never seen before. The box hums faintly, as if alive, and the air around it shimmers with an unnatural warmth.

Curious, you press your palm against the lid. The moment you do, the symbols flare with a soft blue light, and the box *unlocks* with a click. Inside, you find:

1. **A silver key**—its teeth are jagged and uneven, as if it could unlock something far older than the box itself.
2. **A folded parchment**—covered in the same looping script from the box’s surface, but when you unfold it, the ink shifts, rearranging into a new message: *"The door is not where you left it."*
3. **A single black feather**—so light it might as well be made of shadow. When you touch it, a whisper brushes your ear: *"Find the one who lost it."*

The box snaps shut on its own, the key and parchment vanishing. Only the feather remains in your hand. The room around you has changed—walls now stretch endlessly, and the floor is a mosaic of the same symbols from the box.

What do you do next?

(You can choose to follow the feather’s clue, examine the key’s origin, or try to decipher the parchment’s shifting message. Or something else entirely.)
