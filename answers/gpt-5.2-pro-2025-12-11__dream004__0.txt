you come across a blank canvas and a brush that feels warm, like it’s been resting in sunlight. There’s no palette, no cups of water, no jars of pigment—just the brush and the canvas, propped on an easel made of translucent bone-white glass.

When you lift the brush, the air thickens. Colors drift past like fish in a slow river: a streak of orange that smells faintly of cinnamon, a blue so deep it hums against your teeth, a pale green that tastes like rainwater. You dip the brush into nothing at all, and when you pull it back, it’s loaded with a color you can’t name—something between memory and anticipation.

You make a single stroke across the canvas.

The stroke doesn’t sit on the surface. It opens.

A narrow path appears where the paint should be, a slit of space that leads into the canvas like a door cut into paper. The world around you leans in, eager, and the shifting shapes overhead pause as if listening. You step closer, and the path widens until you can see inside: a horizon made of layered brushstrokes, clouds dabbed with a careful hand, a sky unfinished at the edges.

The canvas wants you to enter.

You touch it with your fingertips and feel a dry, grainy texture like sanded wood. Then the surface yields, cool and soft, and you push through.

On the other side, you’re standing on a field of wet paint. It doesn’t stick to your shoes; it ripples away from each step, rearranging itself into patterns that resemble footprints only in the way a dream resembles a story—suggestive, but never fixed. Above you, geometric shapes float and dissolve: cubes that breathe into spheres, triangles that fold into birds, spirals that unravel into ribbons of smoke.

A voice speaks from somewhere behind your left ear, not loud but unmistakable, like someone whispering from inside your skull.

“Choose what this place becomes.”

You look down. The brush is still in your hand.

In the distance, a mountain rises and collapses in the same motion, like a wave caught mid-break. To your right, a city flickers—buildings assembling themselves out of lines, then unspooling back into sketch marks. To your left, an ocean ripples in hard-edged polygons, each facet reflecting a different hour of the day.

You try to decide where to begin, but the decision slides away as soon as you reach for it. Everything is moving too fast, and none of it is wrong.

So you do the only thing that feels honest: you paint without planning.

You swing the brush in a wide arc. A band of color streaks across the air, and the sky obeys. The band becomes a ribbon of sunset, then a wall, then a bridge. Under it, the collapsing mountain steadies, as if grateful for an excuse to be solid. Its surface textures into something halfway between rock and velvet, mottled with flecks of gold that drift like slow sparks.

You paint a line down toward the city, and the line becomes a river. Not water—ink. It flows with the viscosity of handwriting, carrying letters that almost form words before they dissolve into curls. The city leans toward the river and begins to reflect in it, and for a moment it looks like a real place you might have visited, with windows lit and streets that go somewhere.

Then the moment changes its mind. The windows become eyes. The streets turn into veins. The city shivers, not with fear but with possibility.

You laugh—partly because it’s funny, partly because it’s terrifying, partly because the sound of your laughter makes the air blush pink. The voice near your ear chuckles too, but it’s your own chuckle, delayed by half a heartbeat.

You paint a circle at your feet. The circle sinks into the paint-field and rises again as a pond. It’s perfectly still. When you look into it, you don’t see your face. You see a small room: a lamp, a bed, a pile of clothes, a window with night pressed against it like a palm. The room is so ordinary it hurts.

You pull back, startled. The pond ripples, and the room distorts into a kaleidoscope of angles.

“Is that me?” you ask.

The voice answers, “It’s one version.”

You crouch and dip the brush into the pond. When you lift it, the bristles drip with that ordinary room—lamp-light yellow, shadow-gray, the soft beige of walls. You paint the color into the sky, and suddenly the air is filled with the scent of dust and clean fabric, the sound of a distant refrigerator, the hum of real life. The surreal shapes overhead falter, as if confused by familiarity.

You paint again, and the field of wet paint under your feet becomes a floor. Wooden planks spread outward, each one appearing with a subtle creak. The shifting city in the distance blinks and begins to settle into something quieter: houses, trees, the steady logic of gravity.

But as the dream steadies, it also narrows. The horizon pulls in. The colors lose some of their wildness, their willingness to be anything.

You hesitate with the brush poised.

If you keep painting this way, you could make it normal. You could make it safe. You could make it match that room in the pond until there’s nothing left of the impossible.

The voice murmurs, softer now. “Do you want it to be true, or do you want it to be alive?”

You don’t know how to answer. Your hand trembles, and a small drop falls from the brush.

Where it lands, something new appears—not a color, but a sensation. A bright, sharp feeling like the first breath after you’ve been underwater too long. The drop expands into a crack of light in the wooden floor, and through it you glimpse the original blank canvas on the easel, waiting on the other side of everything.

You understand then: the canvas wasn’t a door out. It was a mirror in.

You walk toward the crack. With each step, the world around you rewrites itself, trying to persuade you to stay: the river spells your name in cursive, the mountain forms a silhouette of someone you miss, the city lights up like it’s celebrating your return. The pond shows the room again, but now the room’s window is open, and you can hear distant traffic—real, familiar, tethering.

You stop at the edge of the crack and look back. The sky—your sky—holds your wild ribbon of sunset, still suspended like a thought mid-sentence.

You raise the brush one last time and paint a small dot of that unnamed color right at the center of the horizon.

The dot becomes a star. Not a star that belongs to any constellation, but one that seems to promise: This can change again. This can keep becoming.

The voice near your ear exhales, satisfied.

Then the crack widens, not violently but gently, like eyelids parting. Light pours through. The world of paint, shape, and impossible physics thins to a film. You feel yourself being drawn backward, as if the canvas is pulling you into its blankness.

As you pass through, you catch one final glimpse of the star you made, steady in a sky that wants to keep moving.

And then—

you’re in your bed, in your room, with the weight of sheets and the familiar darkness pressed against the window. The air is quiet. Your hands are empty.

But when you flex your fingers, you swear you can still feel the brush: warm, patient, waiting.

And for a moment, in the far corner of your vision, the darkness shifts into a shade you can’t name.
