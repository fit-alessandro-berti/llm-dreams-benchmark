...and a brush that feels like an extension of your own nervous system. You dip it into the air, catching a stray fragment of a singing triangle, and touch it to the cloth.

The moment the color hits the fabric, it stops moving. The singing triangle becomes a still image of a memory you thought you'd lost. You realize the canvas captures moments from the chaos and freezes them into meaning. You paint furiously, trying to catch the beauty before it morphs again. A laugh becomes a yellow swirl. A fear becomes a jagged black line.

Soon, the canvas is full. It vibrates with captured time. You step back, and the painting detaches from its frame, floating before you like a shield. The chaotic world behind it begins to fade, replaced by the quiet stability of the image you created. You understand now: you weren't meant to explore the landscape. You were meant to curate it. 

You touch the floating painting, and as your finger meets the surface, the dream dissolves into the quiet confidence of a job well done, leaving you with the lingering sensation of holding a brush in your hand as you wake.
