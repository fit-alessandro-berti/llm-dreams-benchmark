You start to walk down the bustling streets, the towering skyscrapers casting long shadows that dance under the flickering streetlights. The sounds of honking cars, distant chatter, and the occasional siren blend into a chaotic symphony that heightens your sense of urgency. As you navigate through the maze-like avenues, the architecture shifts unpredictably—buildings morph from modern glass facades to ornate, ancient structures adorned with intricate carvings.

Passing a vibrant market square, you catch a glimpse of a familiar landmark: a large clock tower with golden hands pointing to midnight. A sense of déjà vu washes over you, prompting you to veer in that direction, hoping it might lead you closer to your destination. The streets seem to elongate unnaturally, each step taking you deeper into the heart of the city, yet the meeting place remains elusive.

Suddenly, the sky darkens, and a gentle rain begins to fall, each drop shimmering like liquid silver under the city lights. People around you start to blur, their faces merging into a tapestry of fleeting expressions. You notice a narrow alleyway to your left, its entrance framed by ivy-covered walls that seem to pulse with a life of their own. Compelled by an inexplicable force, you enter the alley, the sounds of the main street fading into a serene silence.

Inside, the alley opens into a hidden courtyard illuminated by soft, ethereal glow emanating from lanterns hanging above. In the center stands a grand, ornate door with intricate symbols etched into its surface. A key floats in the air before you, rotating slowly, waiting for you to take it. As you reach out and grasp the key, a surge of clarity washes over you—this is the place. You insert the key into the door, and it swings open to reveal a room bathed in warm light, where your important meeting awaits. Stepping through, you wake up with a start, the details of the dream lingering vividly in your mind, leaving you both relieved and curious about its meaning.
