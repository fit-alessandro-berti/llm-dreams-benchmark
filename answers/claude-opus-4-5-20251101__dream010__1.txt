*settling into the dream*

...and the challenges keep shifting in that unsettling dream-logic way.

The first challenge seems straightforward: I'm in a vast library, and I need to find \the answer.\ But every book I open contains only questions written in my own handwriting. I realize I'm not supposed to find an answer—I'm supposed to find the *right question*. I pull a slim volume from a bottom shelf, and inside is just: \d you do if you couldn't fail?\ The judges nod.

The second challenge: I'm at a long table with the other competitors, but their faces keep changing—sometimes they're strangers, sometimes versions of myself at different ages. We're told to build something, but the materials are abstract: regret, curiosity, 3 AM thoughts, the smell of rain. I shape them into something like a bridge, or maybe a conversation.

Then the final challenge. I'm alone in a room with an empty chair. A voice says: \Convince us you deserve this.\

I sit down across from the emptiness and realize—*I'm* supposed to be in that chair. The interviewer is me.

\Why do you want this?\ I ask myself.

And just as I open my mouth to answer, I feel the dream thinning at the edges...

*What do I say before I wake?*
