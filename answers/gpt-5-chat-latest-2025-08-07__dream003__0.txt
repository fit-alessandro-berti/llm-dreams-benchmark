…delicate engravings that seem to shift when you’re not looking directly at them. Moonlight spills over the surface of the box, and for a moment you could swear the silver lines in the design are moving like streams of liquid mercury.  

When you run your fingers across the patterns, they feel warm—almost like skin. A faint hum vibrates through your fingertips, and a low, distant whisper begins to form at the edge of your hearing, speaking syllables in a language you almost—but don’t quite—understand.  

You turn the box over and see that one of the engravings resembles an eye. As your gaze locks with it, the pupil dilates and a flash of light pulses through the patterns, rearranging them into something new: a spiral path leading inward. Unknowingly, your thumb traces this path… and the room around you tilts.  

The air grows heavy with the scent of rain on dry earth. Shadows cling to impossible angles. Before your eyes, the top of the box folds open—not on a hinge, but like petals unfurling, revealing…  

Would you like me to continue into something wondrous and mystical, or something eerie and unsettling?
