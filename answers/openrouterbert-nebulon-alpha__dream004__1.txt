Ah, the dream unfolds like liquid light—

The blank canvas before you isn’t empty at all. It *breathes*. Its surface ripples like water, then hardens into a mirror, reflecting not your face but the shifting hues of the sky behind you: a swirl of violet, gold, and a deep, impossible green that doesn’t exist in waking life. You reach out, and your fingers sink into the canvas as if it’s made of mist. The moment you touch it, the world *tilts*.

The landscape around you dissolves into brushstrokes. Trees become splashes of emerald and cobalt, their branches curling into calligraphy. The ground beneath your feet is now a palette, each step leaving a smear of color—your footprints bloom into flowers that wilt and regrow in seconds. A river of molten silver winds through the scene, its surface etched with faces you almost recognize: a childhood friend, a stranger from a train, the barista who always gets your order wrong. They whisper in voices like wind chimes, but the words dissolve before you can grasp them.

Then, the canvas *pulls* you in.

You’re no longer standing before it—you’re *inside* it, a figure in a painting that’s still being painted. A hand (whose? yours?) dips a brush into the air itself, which thickens into pigment. The strokes are deliberate, chaotic, *alive*. A mountain rises where there was flatness, its peak crowned with a clock melting like Dali’s, but the numbers rearrange themselves into a riddle: *"What is the color of forgetting?"* The sky answers by raining down feathers—each one a different shade of blue, each one dissolving into smoke when it touches the ground.

A voice, neither male nor female, murmurs in your ear: *"You’re the artist now. What will you erase?"*

You look down. Your own hands are translucent, holding a brush that’s also a key, also a bird in mid-flight. The canvas stretches infinitely in all directions, but at its center is a single, untouched white square. It hums with potential, with *you*. The colors around you begin to bleed toward it, hungry, but the voice warns: *"Not all dreams should be finished."*

Do you paint? Do you wake? Or do you let the blankness swallow you whole, becoming part of the dream’s endless, shifting skin?

(What do *you* see in the white square?)
