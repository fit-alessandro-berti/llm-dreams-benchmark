You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are not about the subject you studied—instead, they’re written in shifting symbols that morph as you stare at them. The first question dissolves into a riddle: *"What would you sacrifice to succeed?"* The next appears as a mirror, reflecting your anxious face alongside the words: *"Is this path yours, or someone else’s dream?"* Panic rises as each question probes deeper, unraveling your doubts and desires. The final one glows faintly: *"When did you stop trusting yourself?"* You grip your pencil, realizing this isn’t a test of knowledge—it’s a trial of self-belief.  

The dream lingers in the space between ambition and fear, leaving you to wonder: Is the exam judging you, or are you judging yourself?
