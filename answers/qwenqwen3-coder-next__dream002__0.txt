…you feel a storm approaching and *the world exhales*—not with wind, but with a low, resonant hum that vibrates up through the soles of your feet. The trees don’t sway. Instead, their bark ripples like water, and leaves unfold into iridescent wings—dozens of tiny, silver-bellied moths lifting into the air in a slow, synchronized swirl. Raindrops don’t fall; they *drift*—slow, pearlescent spheres that hang suspended just above your head, each one containing a tiny, shifting scene: a childhood home, a forgotten birthday, the exact shade of your grandmother’s eyes.

You realize, with a drowsy certainty, that this is a *dream-storm*—not danger, but a storm of memory and meaning. The hum grows warmer, softer, like a lullaby woven from lightning. Then the largest tree ahead splits—not apart, but *unfurls*—its trunk peeling back like a book opening to reveal not wood, but a passage of glowing amber light. At the threshold stands a fox, its fur the color of embers, holding a key made of woven willow and moonlight. It tilts its head and speaks, not with sound, but with a scent: old paper, rain on stone, and the first green shoots of spring.

You know, deep in the dream, that stepping forward means waking—but the key feels warm in your palm already, and the forest is waiting.  
What do you do?
