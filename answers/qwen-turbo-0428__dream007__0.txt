You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to walk away—just for a moment. You step outside into the cool night air, the world around you suddenly quiet, as if holding its breath. The stars above seem brighter, more alive, as if they’re watching, waiting.

As you stand there, the argument fades into the background, replaced by the sound of your own breathing. You close your eyes, and when you open them again, the world has changed. The street where you stood is now a vast, endless field under a sky that shifts between twilight and dawn. The air smells like rain and possibility.

Your friend appears beside you, not angry anymore, but calm, their face softened by the light. They say nothing at first, just look out at the horizon. Then they speak, not with words, but with a feeling—a deep understanding that you’ve both been carrying the same weight, but from different sides.

In this dream, you don’t resolve the argument. Instead, you let it exist, unspoken, in the space between you. And somehow, that’s enough. You feel lighter, as if the dream has given you a glimpse of what could be if you both chose to listen, not to win, but to understand.

And then, slowly, the dream begins to fade, but the feeling stays with you—a quiet certainty that some things are meant to be worked through, not fixed.
