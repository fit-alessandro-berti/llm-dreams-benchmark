...begin to feel a strange, tickling pressure in my throat. I open my mouth, ready to deliver my powerful opening line, but what comes out is not a word. It's a single, low, resonant musical note. It hangs in the air, vibrating through the floorboards and into my feet.

The audience is silent, their faces a mixture of confusion and intrigue. I try again, focusing, thinking of the words on the page I can't quite remember. This time, a different note emerges, a higher, clearer one that harmonizes with the first. They weave together, creating a chord that shimmers in the spotlight.

My panic begins to subside, replaced by a strange curiosity. I'm not giving a speech; I'm conducting an orchestra with my own breath. I lift my hands, not in a gesture of helplessness, but like a maestro. As I do, the notes change. A sweep of my left hand produces a cascade of harp-like arpeggios that glitter in the air. A firm, downward motion of my right hand summons a deep, cello-like thrum that makes the whole room feel warm and safe.

The audience is no longer just watching. The people in the front row begin to hum along, their voices perfectly in tune. The man in the third row, who had been scowling, now has tears streaming down his face, but he is smiling. The music is telling a story I could never have written down—a story of shared sadness, of quiet joy, of the universal feeling of being small under a vast, starry sky.

I look down at my body. My business suit has dissolved, replaced by a robe made of deep blue twilight, dotted with tiny, pulsing lights like distant galaxies. My feet are bare on the stage, which is no longer made of wood, but of cool, smooth obsidian that reflects the starlight of my robe.

I am no longer nervous. I am home. I take a deep, final breath and release the most beautiful chord of all. It doesn't just fill the room; it pushes the walls away, dissolving the theater entirely, until we are all—myself and the entire audience—floating in a gentle, silent cosmos, connected by the ghost of a perfect sound.
