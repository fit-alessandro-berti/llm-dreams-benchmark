...feel a cold knot of dread tighten in your stomach. The stack of requirements is a mountain, and the timeline is a single, flimsy ladder. Your colleagues' faces are a blur of polite expectation and thinly veiled pity.

You open your mouth to list the dozen reasons why this can't be done, to explain about resource allocation and the laws of physics, but your voice catches. Instead, you hear yourself say, "Okay. Let's break this down."

The words hang in the air, and a strange calm settles over you. The impossible deadline stops being a wall and becomes a puzzle. You grab a whiteboard marker, and as you begin to sketch out a frantic, stripped-down plan, the lines and boxes don't represent tasks anymore; they are stepping stones across a raging river.

Your boss's impatient tapping morphs into the rhythmic clicking of a train on its tracks. The office walls dissolve, replaced by the blur of passing landscapes. You are on a high-speed train, and the project plan is the track unfolding endlessly ahead of you. You aren't writing code or designing graphics anymore; you are shoveling coal into a blazing furnace, your face smudged with soot, driving the engine faster and faster. The wind whips through your hair, and the "impossible" deadline is just a destination, a station you are hurtling towards with exhilarating, terrifying speed. You know you might arrive with sparks flying and wheels smoking, but you are moving, and for now, in the dream, that is all that matters.
