in a language you’ve never seen before, filled with strange symbols and glyphs that shimmer faintly on the page. You blink, hoping it’s just nerves, but the text doesn’t change. The room around you starts to feel oddly distant, like you’re sitting in a glass bubble, and the other students are scribbling away as if nothing’s wrong. You raise your hand to ask the proctor for help, but when they turn to you, their face is a blank, featureless mask. A low hum fills the air, growing louder, and the exam paper begins to glow. Suddenly, the symbols lift off the page, swirling around you like fireflies, and you realize they’re forming words you can somehow understand: “This is not the test you were expecting.” 
Your heart races as the room dissolves into a vast, starry void. The proctor’s voice echoes, now deep and resonant, “The real exam is survival.” A distant planet materializes beneath your feet, its surface cracked and red, and you hear footsteps approaching from behind—slow, deliberate, and heavy. You turn, and there’s a figure cloaked in shadow, holding out a single, blank sheet of paper. They say, “Write your future.” 
What do you do next?
