You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns etched into its surface—swirling constellations, fractal geometries, and symbols that seem to shift when you blink. The metal is cold, but your fingers tingle as they trace the grooves, as if the box is alive, breathing in tandem with your pulse.  

A whisper, not from the air but from *inside* the box, murmurs, *"What is hidden is not lost—only waiting."* You glance around, but the room is empty. The patterns suddenly glow faintly, and the box’s lid creaks open a sliver, revealing a mirror-like surface within. Your reflection stares back, but its eyes are hollow, and it mouths a word you can’t hear.  

Suddenly, the patterns rearrange themselves into a spiral, and you realize they’re a map—of your own memories. A childhood memory flickers: you, as a child, hiding a key in a tree. The box hums, and the lid slides open fully, revealing not treasure, but a single feather. It floats upward, and as you reach for it, the dream shifts.  

You’re standing in a field of endless twilight, the box now a hollow shell. The feather dissolves into stardust, and the sky erupts with constellations that form your face, smiling. The whisper returns, softer this time: *"The key was never outside. It was the question you forgot to ask."*  

And then you wake, clutching nothing but the echo of a sigh.
