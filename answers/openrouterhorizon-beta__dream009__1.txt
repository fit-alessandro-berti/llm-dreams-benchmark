…survive the day, not the decade. The light has a different quality to it—clean and angled, as though the sun has been polished. The air tastes of tannin and woodsmoke. The village you stumble into is a comb of low, thatched roofs clinging to a river’s bend, and everywhere there are hands: hauling nets, kneading dough, sweeping straw from a doorway with a birch broom. Every hand has a task, and every task has a memory you do not share.

You realize you need to learn the language fast. Your mouth tries vowels like river stones, round and uncertain. You point, you mimic, and people laugh in the way that means kindness and curiosity. A child presses an apple into your palm as if appeasing a mild god. You say thank you in three different guesses and finally get the sound right enough that the grandmother nods.

You realize you need to make yourself useful. So you start with your body. You carry water, because water is heavy in any century. You split wood with a blunt iron wedge and discover that the rhythm—raise, breathe in; strike, breathe out—can carry you through an afternoon. You learn to watch the chickens, the way their feet stir the dust before rain, the way the dog’s ears prick to a distant cart long before you hear it. The world broadcasts if you’re quiet enough to receive.

You realize you need to make a map, not on paper, but in footsteps. The path to the river bends around a willow whose roots hold the bank together. The smoke house is three doors down from the mill, and if you stand in its shadow at noon, the sun will point you straight to the fields of flax. Two hills to the west are like sleeping animals; the smaller has a scar of chalk, the larger keeps the evening light longer, which means if you are late and the light is thin, aim for the bigger hill.

You need to hide the absurdity of your clothing. You trade a belt buckle for a roughspun tunic the color of the river at dawn, and suddenly you are less glare, more background. In a world without zippers, you become an apprentice to knots.

You need to answer questions without telling the truth, because there isn’t a truth here that fits. Where is your family? You gesture vaguely toward the road, say the word for far, say the word for lost. They nod in a way that is both pity and companionship; loss is a language everyone speaks.

You need to remember the skills your great-grandparents almost taught you. You pull the needles from your memory. You stitch a crude seam. You watch a woman card wool, her hands turning clouds into thread; you try and burn your fingers once, then again, then not at all. At night, by the hearth, someone hums a minor melody, and the notes braid themselves into the sound of wind in rafters.

You need to find where danger lives here. It lives in the river when it swells and bites the bank away. It lives in a mismatch of dates and saints’ days, in a lord’s temper like a thunderhead. It lives in the forest’s edge where traps wait for fur and sometimes forget their purpose. It lives in the midwives’ glances when a fever doesn’t break. It lives in food, in the soft blush on a mushroom that means wait, do not.

You need to measure your days differently. Not by screens or alerts, but by shadows moving across a floor. By how long it takes bread to rise on a warm stone. By the time between crows recalling themselves to the field.

Someone teaches you a prayer that isn’t yours but can be worn like a cloak in the rain. Someone shows you how to read tracks in mud—hoof, boot, paw—and how to tell a fox from a stray dog. Someone tells you stories of monsters in the fen; you nod, because you have seen legends in office lobbies, too.

Then, when you’ve learned to keep your head down and your hands busy, the dream does what dreams do: it brings you a hinge. The lord’s men ride through, and their horses shine like newer coins. In their wake they leave a proclamation pegged to the oak: taxes will rise. Later, in the dark of the bakehouse, someone whispers about hiding grain in the clay beneath the oven. Another voice whispers about running. A third voice—yours—recognizes the cadence of urgency, the way the present narrows to a point.

You realize you need to choose what kind of person you will be in a time that will not remember your name. Do you take your strange knowledge and become a wisewoman, a tinker, a quiet tool passed hand to hand? Do you keep your head lowered and your mouth softer than your thoughts? Or do you lift your eyes to the larger hill and think: if this village is a map, perhaps it is also a beginning.

On the seventh morning (you only know because the moon says so), a cart creaks past loaded with flax and rumor. The driver, a man with shoulders like parentheses, offers a place to sit in exchange for another pair of eyes on the road. You climb up. Behind you, a child waves with both hands; ahead, the ruts open like a script you are learning to read.

You realize you need to name this era something other than before or after. So you call it during. You are living during. The river keeps its counsel. The sun is punctual. The cart sings to itself on the stones. Somewhere a hawk writes circles into a pale sky, and you think: I can do this. You adjust your grip on the sideboard and lean into the turn, as if you were always meant to be carried forward by what you do not yet understand.
