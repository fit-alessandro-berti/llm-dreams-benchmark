take a deep breath and step outside for a moment. The air outside is thick and shimmery, like heat rising from asphalt, but it smells sweet, like blooming night flowers. 

You walk down a winding path that wasn't there before, lined with glowing stones that hum softly underfoot. As you walk, you realize youâ€™re no longer upset â€” in fact, you can barely remember what the fight was about. 

Ahead, your friend appears, but they're different â€” taller, almost translucent, their voice echoing without sound. They reach out their hand, and when you take it, a rush of memories floods your mind â€” not just yours, but theirs too. You see the argument from their eyes: the fear, the hurt, the hopes tucked underneath every word.

When you look up again, you're both standing in a field of tall grass under a velvet sky strewn with stars, a place where words arenâ€™t needed anymore. 

Would you like me to continue the dream from here? ðŸŒ™
