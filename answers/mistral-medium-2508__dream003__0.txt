symbols etched into its surface—some resembling constellations, others like ancient runes or alchemical signs. The box hums faintly under your fingertips, as if alive, and the air around it shimmers with a faint, otherworldly glow.

Just as you trace a spiraling symbol near the latch, the box *clicks*. A hidden compartment slides open, revealing a small, iridescent key—no, not a key, but a **feather**. It’s unlike any you’ve seen: its quill is made of what looks like frozen starlight, and the vane shifts colors like oil on water, pulsing in time with your breath.

As you lift it, the box’s lid creaks open on its own. Inside, there’s no treasure, no gold—just a **mirror**. But it doesn’t reflect your face. Instead, it shows a version of you standing in a vast, twilight library, shelves stretching into infinity. The other *you* turns, holds up a book bound in the same material as the box, and mouths words you can’t hear. Then, the mirror’s surface ripples like water, and a single sentence forms in ink across the glass:

**"The lock was never on the box."**

The feather in your hand grows warm. When you look down, the box is gone—replaced by a **door**, carved with the same symbols, standing where the box once was. The feather now fits perfectly into the door’s keyhole. Behind it, you hear the whisper of pages turning, and a voice—your own, but older, wiser—murmurs:

*"You’ve been holding the key since before you were born."*

**What do you do next?**
(Do you turn the feather? Step through without it? Or something else entirely?)
