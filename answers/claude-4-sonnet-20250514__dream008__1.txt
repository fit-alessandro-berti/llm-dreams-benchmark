...stare at the blank computer screen, but instead of panic, you feel a strange calm washing over you. You begin typing, and somehow your fingers know exactly what to do - the words and ideas flow effortlessly, as if the project is completing itself.

But then you notice something odd: the office around you starts to shift. The walls begin stretching upward like taffy, and your coworkers' faces become blurry and indistinct. Your boss is still there, but now they're floating slightly above the ground, nodding approvingly at your impossible progress.

The deadline that seemed so crushing moments ago now feels elastic - time itself bends around your work. Hours pass in minutes, or perhaps minutes stretch into hours. The project grows more elaborate and beautiful than anything you could create while awake, filled with brilliant solutions you've never thought of before.

Just as you're about to present your miraculous work, you realize your computer keyboard has transformed into piano keys, and instead of a presentation, you're composing a symphony that somehow perfectly captures everything you meant to say. Your boss smiles and begins to applaud, but the sound echoes strangely, growing fainter and fainter until...

You sense you're beginning to wake up, that familiar feeling of a dream dissolving at the edges, leaving only fragments of that impossible deadline and the memory of effortless creation.
