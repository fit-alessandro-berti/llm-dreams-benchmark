You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **pause, take a deep breath, and ask if you both could maybe step outside for a moment. It felt like the energy in the room was suffocating, thick with tension, and the open air might clear our heads, even if just a little. I didn't want to *stop* talking about it, not really, because the issue mattered too much, but the way we were fighting felt wrong, destructive instead of constructive. Just a few minutes apart, away from the shouting, maybe we could recenter ourselves.**
