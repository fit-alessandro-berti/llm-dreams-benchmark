You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to… **notice the chairs. All of them. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of identical, plush, velvet chairs, stretching back into infinity. They are a deep, unsettling shade of lavender, and each one is perfectly arranged in neat, symmetrical rows. It’s not just the sheer number, it's the *lack* of people sitting in them. Empty. Deserted. A silent, lavender sea stretching before you.

My carefully prepared speech, the one about the interconnectedness of all things and the importance of embracing vulnerability, vanishes. Replaced. All that remains is a single, echoing question: "Why are there so many chairs?"

A tiny, porcelain doll, no bigger than my thumb, lands on the podium beside me. It stares up at me with unnervingly intelligent blue eyes. It doesn’t speak, but its gaze feels…judgemental.  

A single spotlight focuses on a chair in the very back row. It shimmers, almost like it’s made of heat haze. And then, from behind that chair, a faint melody begins to play – a lullaby I haven’t heard since I was a child, a lullaby sung by my grandmother, who passed away years ago. 

Suddenly, the lavender chairs start to *hum*. A low, vibrating sound that tickles my teeth. The air thickens, and I realize I’m not just seeing chairs, I’m feeling them. The cool velvet, the silent anticipation, the lonely emptiness.

My mouth opens, but no words come out. Only a small, whimpering sound.  The porcelain doll tilts its head. 

And then, I see something reflected in its glassy eyes – not my own face, but a fleeting image of myself, small and vulnerable, sitting alone on a single lavender chair in a vast, echoing hall. A profound sadness washes over me, a feeling of being perpetually uninvited, always on the periphery.

The lullaby swells, and the humming of the chairs intensifies. I'm drowning in lavender, in emptiness, in the silent question: Why are there so many chairs?  And the doll… the doll is still watching, waiting for an answer I don't know how to give.**
