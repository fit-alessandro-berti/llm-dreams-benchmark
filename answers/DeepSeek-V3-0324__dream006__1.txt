**Dream Continuation:**  

As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak—but no sound comes out. You clear your throat, tap the microphone, yet the silence lingers. The audience tilts their heads in confusion.  

Then, you notice something strange: their faces are blurring, shifting like watercolors. The stage beneath your feet softens, and suddenly, you're standing not in an auditorium, but on a vast, floating platform in the sky. The crowd is gone, replaced by a swirling galaxy of stars.  

A deep voice echoes—not from around you, but from *within* you:  

*"What do you truly wish to say?"*  

You open your mouth again, and this time, your voice booms across the cosmos, shaping the stars into words, into stories, into truths you didn’t even know you carried. The dream isn’t about the speech—it’s about finding the voice you’ve always had.  

Then, just as suddenly, you wake up—heart pounding, the weight of the universe still humming in your chest.  

*(Dreams often reflect our subconscious fears and desires. What do you think this one means for you?)*
