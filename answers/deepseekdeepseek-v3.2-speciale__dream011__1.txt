You notice the questions are... not about the course material at all. Instead, each one asks something deeply personal: "What is your greatest passion?", "What would you do if you had no limitations?", "Describe a moment when you felt truly alive." Your initial panic gives way to curiosity. You look around; the other students are writing intently, as if this were perfectly normal. You pick up your pen and begin to answer. As you write, the words seem to take on a life of their own, glowing faintly. The exam hall fades, replaced by a serene landscape. A figure appears—an older version of yourself—smiling knowingly. "You've always known the answers," they say. "Now go, create that future." You blink, and you're back in the exam room, but the paper is blank again, except for a single word: "Begin." You wake up, the dream still vivid, ready to embrace the day and shape your career with intention.
