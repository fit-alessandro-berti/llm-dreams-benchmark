...feel a strange lightness, as if my feet aren't quite touching the stage. The spotlight, usually a hot, focused beam, seems to diffuse into a gentle, iridescent glow. I open my mouth to speak, the carefully crafted words of my introduction ready, but instead, a melody pours out. 

Not my voice, not exactly. It's a chorus of voices, layered and harmonious, like a thousand hummingbirds taking flight in unison. The audience sways slightly, their faces reflecting the shifting colors of the light. Are they… humming along?

I look down at my hands, expecting to see my notes, but they're empty. Instead, they're moving, conducting the ethereal music that fills the auditorium. I don't remember practicing this, don't remember composing it. Yet, it feels familiar, like a song I've always known, buried deep within my soul.

The music shifts, becoming more vibrant, more rhythmic. The stage beneath me transforms. The solid wood planks dissolve into a field of luminescent flowers, each blossom pulsing with light in time to the melody. I'm no longer standing still; I'm dancing, gliding effortlessly across the blooming stage, my movements fluid and graceful as if I'm made of air.

The audience transforms too. Their expectant faces become radiant, their bodies swaying not just in time to the music, but as if they are part of it, a living tapestry woven with sound and light. I feel a connection to them, a shared understanding that transcends words.

The music builds to a crescendo, a joyful explosion of pure sound and light. Then, as suddenly as it began, it fades, leaving only a lingering echo in the air. The flowers vanish, the stage returns to solid wood beneath my feet. The audience is still there, their faces filled with an emotion I can't quite name, a mixture of wonder and contentment.

I look down at my hands, now holding my notes, the familiar words blurring before my eyes. I glance up at the microphone, the words of my prepared speech lost somewhere between the melody and the flowers. What was I supposed to say? What words could possibly follow the symphony that just unfolded?

Then, a single voice rises from the crowd, clear and strong. "Thank you."

And another, and another, until the entire auditorium is filled with a chorus of thanks. They understood, they felt it. The speech, whatever it was supposed to be, was unnecessary. The music had spoken for me, for all of us.

I smile, a feeling of profound peace washing over me. The dream begins to fade, the lights of the auditorium dissolving into the soft glow of my bedroom ceiling. But the melody, the faint echo of a thousand hummingbirds, lingers, a reminder that sometimes, the most powerful messages are spoken not with words, but with the language of the soul.
