Okay, I'm there... the salt spray is real, stinging my eyes, the wind a banshee howl tearing at my oilskins. The deck beneath my boots pitches and yaws like a maddened beast. My crew, bless their loyal hearts, are pale faces in the gloom, their eyes fixed on me, wide with a mixture of terror and desperate hope.

...and you **grip the ship's wheel, knuckles white, the wood slick and vibrating with the fury of the ocean.** The mast groans, a sound that goes right through your bones, like the world itself is about to crack open.

"STEADY!" you roar, your voice barely audible above the storm's symphony of destruction. "HOLD FAST TO THE LINES! SHE'S A GOOD SHIP, SHE'LL SEE US THROUGH!" But even as you say it, a monstrous wave, a moving mountain of black water, rears up on the port side, its crest foaming like a rabid animal.

There's no time to steer away. It's going to hit. You brace, shouting, "EVERYONE HANG ON!"

The world becomes a chaotic, roaring whiteness as tons of water crash over the deck. You're submerged, fighting for breath, clinging to the wheel with a death grip. For a moment, you think this is it, the abyss has claimed you.

Then, with a shudder that rattles your teeth, the ship rights herself, groaning, water sluicing off her decks. You spit out saltwater, gasping. Around you, soaked and sputtering, your crew are still there. Some are down, but helping each other up.

But something is different. The storm, while still raging, has a strange, ethereal quality now. The rain isn't just water; it glitters, like falling shards of diamond. And the waves... the waves themselves seem to have faces in them, vast, ancient, and sorrowful, their eyes like swirling nebulae.

One of your crew, old Finnigan, his beard plastered to his chest, points with a trembling hand. "Captain... look! The sea... it's... singing?"

And he's right. Beneath the howl of the wind, a deep, resonant thrumming fills the air, a chorus of unearthly voices. It's beautiful and terrifying. The violet-black water glows with an internal light.

You stare, mesmerized, your fear momentarily forgotten, replaced by a profound, dreamlike awe. The ship isn't fighting the storm anymore; it feels like it's being *drawn* somewhere by this impossible music, towards a horizon that shimmers with colours no waking eye has ever seen.

"Captain?" your first mate, a young woman named Elara, her voice hoarse, touches your arm. "What do we do?"

You look at the impossible sea, at the impossible horizon. A strange certainty settles in your dream-soaked mind.

"We sail towards the music," you say, your voice calm now, almost serene. "We sail towards the light."

And as you turn the wheel, the ship responds, not with a groan of protest, but with a gentle surge, as if it, too, understands this new, strange course. The spectral faces in the waves seem to turn, watching you, their expressions unreadable, as you guide your vessel into the heart of the singing, glittering storm.
