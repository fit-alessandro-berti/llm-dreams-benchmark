# The Dream Continues

You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns carved into its surface—spirals that seem to shift when viewed from different angles, symbols you almost recognize but cannot quite name. The wood feels impossibly old, yet warm to the touch, as if it holds memories of countless hands that have held it before yours.

You turn the box over and discover a series of small brass latches, each one shaped like a crescent moon. They are locked firmly in place, but something about their arrangement suggests a specific order. Above the latches, an inscription in flowing script reads: *"What you seek has already found you."*

The air around the box grows thick with anticipation. In your dream-state, logic bends easily, and you find yourself whispering a question aloud—"What do you hold?"—though you are not certain to whom the words are directed.

The box hums softly in response, a vibration that travels up through your fingertips and settles somewhere behind your heart. The carved symbols begin to glow with a pale, bioluminescent light, and you realize that the spiraling patterns are not merely decorative—they are a map, a code, a story waiting to be read.

Do you try to unlock the latches in sequence, following the phases of the moons? Or do you close your eyes and simply listen to what the box might be trying to tell you? The dream holds its breath, waiting for your next move, knowing that whatever choice you make will reveal something you were always meant to find.
