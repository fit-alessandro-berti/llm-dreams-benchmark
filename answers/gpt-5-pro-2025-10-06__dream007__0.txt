…pick it up with both hands.

It isn’t words anymore, not exactly. It has a weight and a warmth, a slickness like a fish or a newborn planet. It kicks like a bird trapped in a shirt. You lift it and feel your palms sting as if you’ve grabbed a handful of stinging nettles. Your friend stares at your hands, at the thing, and the red in their face goes out a little, like someone cupping a candle.

“We can’t keep throwing it,” you say, surprised to hear your own voice sound steady. “It’s breaking on the corners.”

The room you are in is both the kitchen you grew up in and the cafe where you first met them. There is a kettle on the stove and a barista’s tarnished pitcher beside it. Someone’s refrigerator hums behind a chalkboard menu where the specials are all past tense. The tile under your feet is a patchwork of winters. Your friend is wearing the sweater you gave them once and also the jacket you never liked. They have two faces for a moment, one the mask they use when they argue, the other their real one, that mess of earnestness and stubborn joy. Then it is only their face, stern and scared.

“This matters to me,” they say, like the room doesn’t know that already.

“I know,” you say, because it matters to you too, and that’s the worst part.

You tilt the argument. Light sifts through it and reveals fossils: a heel dug into muddy ground, a dinner you didn’t show up for, a laugh you mistook for cruelty. There are little compartments, like a jewelry box, each lined in velvet: beneath one, a promise you both forgot to keep; beneath another, the time they lent you their courage like a sweater in a rainstorm. The argument has teeth and bite marks and also soft places pressed by impatient thumbs.

“Come on,” you say, and you carry it to the sink. The faucet in this kitchen that is also a cafe is a carved swan with water for a neck. When you turn it on the first water that comes out is all the things you didn’t say, cold and metallic. Then it warms, and the steam smells like oranges and old paper, like your grandmother’s handwriting, like chalk on your fingers.

You hold the argument under the stream, rotating it so the stubborn corners catch the water. The nettle-sting dulls to a throb. Your friend crowds close, as if you might drop it, as if you always drop things, as if their hands are itching to help and afraid to burn.

“Why the sink?” they ask, not unkindly.

“So it stops being a fire,” you say. “So we can see what it is when it’s clean.”

They nod and put their fingers in too, and you both hiss through your teeth at the heat. It’s too hot and then just right. The argument’s surface clouds, then clears. Letters slide off it like minnows, tiny flickers of half-phrases darting into the drain. The part of it that was your pride softens. The part that was their fear goes translucent. A seed appears, gleaming at the core.

“There,” you say, and you almost laugh because of course there’s a seed, because dreams are not subtle. “Look.”

You turn off the water. The kettle whistles in a neighbor room and a barista calls out a name that is a bell you wore around your neck in a different life. Your friend leans in, their breath fogging the seed’s skin.

“What would we even grow?” they ask, and you can hear how tired they are of clutching and arguing and guarding.

“Let’s ask,” you say, because asking works in dreams, and sometimes not dreaming.

You carry the seed to the window. The window opens onto a field that is actually the sidewalk and also the road where you learned to ride a bike and also a hill from your favorite book. Grass presses against concrete. A dog is reading a newspaper that is the sky folded into quarters. The moon is hanging low even though it’s day, interested, wearing an apron. You lift the sash and the night drops in a few degrees, a relief.

You both kneel. Your friend’s knees crack the way yours do. You scoop a hole with your hands because there is no shovel, and also because it feels right to do this with your fingers, to push them into the cold dark and make a place. The earth smells like first rain and pennies. You place the seed. It hums like a thought. You cover it. You pat the ground. You don’t make a wish because this is not wishing; this is a transaction: we will give you our heat, our attention, our patience. You will give us whatever you are.

You sit back on your heels. The world holds its breath. For a few heartbeats nothing happens, and you taste panic: what if you washed it too much and drowned it, what if you softened it past repair, what if you have ruined the only important thing. Then the dirt shivers. A green point flows up like a whale surfacing. It unscrolls faster than any growing thing, and also slow as forgivings. It becomes a stem and a stalk, a ladder of leaves, a tree in the space of a sigh. The tree is not tall, but it is full, arms spread, a new table set between you.

Hanging from it are fruits that are not any you recognize: not an orange or an apple or a fig, but a roundness the color of dusk when it forgets to be blue. They pulse with a small inner light, like a firefly in a jar.

“What is it?” your friend whispers, because whispering makes sense here.

“Try one,” you say, because this is what you do with new worlds. Your fingers brush, not by accident. You both reach for the same fruit and then laugh. You take a different one—this one is freckled; that one has a tiny scar. They twist off easily, no struggle.

The bite is everything. It tastes like the first time you told each other the truth and the way you smelled the ocean before you saw it. It tastes like cinnamon and wind, like untying your shoes. It tastes like all the things you were trying to protect by shouting. It is not sweet or bitter exactly; it is bright. As you swallow, a warmth uncurls between your shoulder blades and moves forward. The place in your chest where you keep your flinch loosens. Your friend’s eyes fill and then clear; they wipe them with the heel of their hand as if it’s nothing. You see them as they were when you met and as they will be when you are old and sometimes as they are right now, which is to say complicated and dear.

“So what do we do?” they ask, seeds stuck to their lip.

“We can keep the tree,” you say. “We can come back to it when we need to, instead of carrying the stone around and throwing it at each other.”

“The stone,” they repeat, as if liking the word for the thing better than the thing. “Okay. And if more arguments grow from it?”

“Then we’ll have a whole orchard,” you say, and you both snort at the absurdity and the truth of it. “We’ll learn which ones feed us and which ones we let drop and rot back in.”

The moon in its apron nods, approving, and continues stirring a pot of stars. The dog folds its paper and becomes your childhood pet for a moment and then a stranger again. In the kitchen-cafe the kettle stops its whistle. Somewhere a train goes by with all your old names painted on its cars. The tree rustles, and you imagine there is a bird nested in it that speaks only when you’re asleep, telling you the story you are trying to live.

Back inside, because somehow you are back inside, the table is cleared of all the sharp things. Your friend is close enough to see the triangles of light in their irises. Close enough that you can count the freckles you have always said are the lyric notes to a song only you know. You reach out and set the argument’s empty husk—the part you washed away and couldn’t keep—on the counter. It is soft now, a leathered skin that will dry and get tucked into the back of a drawer with the other talismans that felt life-and-death until the day you learned their true names.

“We were both right,” you say, meaning something different than what you meant an hour ago. “And we were wrong, too.”

“We were just loud,” they say. “We were hungry.”

You nod. Hunger is a better story than hurt. You pour water into two mugs and the tea becomes a lake that shows you faces when you look into it. Yours is there. Theirs is there. A third rises: the argument itself, smaller now, less teeth and more of a spine. It looks young. It looks relieved.

When the alarm starts—someone somewhere ringing a bell, or the wind slapping a loose shutter—you are still holding a fruit that doesn’t exist. Your palms are warm. Your friend’s voice follows you toward waking, becoming the sound of tires on wet roads, becoming your own breath.

You wake up with the taste of bright on your tongue and dirt in your fingernails and the particular ache of having carried something heavy with someone you love and having set it down. The room is just your room. The window is only glass. But when you close your eyes you see a green ladder of leaves, and you know where the tree is, and you know you can get back to it, and you know what to do with your hands.
