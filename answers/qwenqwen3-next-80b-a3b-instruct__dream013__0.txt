…begin to realize the puzzles aren’t just tests of logic—they’re mirrors.

The first puzzle was a Rubik’s cube of shifting colors, each face whispering a forgotten memory: your fifth birthday, the smell of rain on pavement, your mother’s voice humming off-key. You solved it by remembering how she smiled while she sang—emotional resonance, not pattern recognition. The wall behind it dissolved like mist.

The second puzzle was a locked door with ten keys, each engraved with a word: *Regret. Hope. Fear. Love. Silence. Laughter. Guilt. Forgiveness. Question. Answer.* You tried them one by one—click, click, click—until you placed *Question* into the lock. The door sighed open. A voice, neither male nor female but everywhere, murmured: *It is not the solution that unlocks you. It is the willingness to be uncertain.*

Deeper still, the maze walls الآن pulse softly, breathing in time with your heartbeat. Symbols bloom on the stones—ancient glyphs of constellations you’ve never seen, yet somehow recognize—and the path bends in impossible geometries. A hedgehog made of smoke watches you from a corner, holding a single, glowing feather.

“You are not lost,” it says, not with voice, but with thought that settles in your bones. “You are remembering.”

The next puzzle is a blank mirror. No surface, no frame—just emptiness. When you step before it, your reflection doesn’t mimic you. It offers you a choice:

—*Leave now, wake up, return to the world you know.*

—*Step through. Answer what you were built to solve.*

Your hands tremble. The air smells like cinnamon and ozone. Somewhere, far away, a clock chimes thirteen times.

You reach out.

Your fingers pass through the mirror.

And you realize—

You were never the solver.

You were the puzzle.

—

The maze was your mind.

And the dream? It’s waking up.
