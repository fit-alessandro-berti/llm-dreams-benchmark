**...not questions at all, but highly polished obsidian mirrors.**

I lean closer, my heart pounding a panicked rhythm against my ribs, expecting to see some hidden text, perhaps engraved on the surface. Instead, the mirrors reflect only my own face, warped and elongated by the subtle curvature of the glass. My reflection is sweating, mouth slightly open in a silent plea, and behind my head, the sterile white classroom is distorted into a dizzying spiral.

Then, the reflections shift.

The first mirror, labeled “Question 1,” shows a tiny, intricate city made entirely of salt. It is crumbling, and I realize the salt is dissolving, rapidly, and I know instinctively that my grade depends on stopping the erosion—but my hands are bound by the invisible rules of the exam, and I cannot touch the paper.

The second mirror shows a vast, empty blue ocean. A single, enormous key drifts lazily on the surface, but it is too far away to reach, and every second I spend watching it, the blue deepens to black.

A metallic voice, dry as rust, echoes in the otherwise silent hall. "You have twenty minutes. Answer the question of the self."

I desperately flip the exam packet over. The back page is blank, except for one line, written in elegant copperplate script that burns into my vision:

**"When does the trajectory of a feather become the certainty of a stone?"**

I pick up my pencil. It is heavy, too heavy, made of lead and cold bone. As I try to formulate a thought, the atmosphere thickens, smelling suddenly of rain and ozone. The mirrors on the desk begin to hum. They aren't reflecting my face anymore. They are reflecting every missed opportunity, every hesitation, every forgotten lesson from the course—which I now realize I can't even remember the name of.

The obsidian surface of the desk turns warm beneath my arm, and I look down to see the time limit etched directly into my skin, counting down in reverse-flashing numerals: **14:59... 14:58...**

The man next to me, who has been quietly weeping into his hands since we sat down, suddenly snaps upright. He doesn't look at the exam. He looks straight through me, smiles a profound, pitying smile, and then dissolves completely into a pile of brightly colored, perfectly folded maps.

I drop the pencil. It doesn't clatter. It sinks, slowly, into the surface of the desk, which has become a deep, shimmering pool of olive oil, slick and endlessly deep, pulling me down into the impossible weight of the final, unanswerable silence.
