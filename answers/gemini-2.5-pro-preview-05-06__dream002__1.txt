...and you feel a storm approaching and the air crackles with an electric charge, making the hairs on your arms stand on end. The sky, moments ago a gentle blue, is now a boiling cauldron of bruised purples and angry greys.

A low, guttural growl of thunder rumbles in the distance, rapidly drawing closer, like an unseen beast. The trees, once serene sentinels, begin to thrash wildly, their leaves ripped away like frantic confetti, swirling around you. The wind, no longer a gentle caress, becomes a solid wall, pushing you, urging you to find shelter.

Panic, cold and sharp, nips at your heels. You scan the darkening woods, your heart hammering against your ribs. Just as the first fat, cold raindrops begin to splatter against your face, you spot it – an ancient, gnarled oak, impossibly wide. Its trunk seems to pulse with a faint, inner light.

As you stumble towards it, a particularly violent gust tears through the canopy, and a section of bark on the oak, like a hidden door, creaks open, revealing a hollow within. It’s not dark inside. A soft, warm, golden light emanates from the core of the tree.

Hesitantly, you step inside. The roar of the storm instantly muffles, replaced by a strange, gentle humming, like a thousand distant voices singing a single, harmonious note. The air is warm and smells of honey and old parchment. In the center of the hollow, instead of rough wood, the walls are smooth, almost like polished amber, and they curve upwards to a point where a single, glowing seed, the size of your fist, hangs suspended, casting the golden light.

You reach out a hand, drawn to it, and as your fingers brush against its warm surface, the humming intensifies, and the light flares. Suddenly, the wooden walls around you dissolve into a swirling vortex of starlight. You are no longer in a tree, but floating in a vast, silent cosmos, the glowing seed held gently in your hands. It feels incredibly familiar, like a lost part of yourself, now found. A profound sense of peace, even deeper than the forest's initial tranquility, washes over you. The storm is forgotten, a distant, insignificant memory. You are home.
