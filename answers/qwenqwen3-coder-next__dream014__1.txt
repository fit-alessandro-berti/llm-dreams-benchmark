You accept their offer—just a hesitant nod, since your voice feels thick with unshed tears. The strangers don’t ask *why* you’re lost, only *how* you got here, and when you whisper, “I followed the wrong streetlight,” one of them—someone with silver-streaked hair and eyes that crinkle like worn paper—smiles softly.

“Ah,” they say. “Those streetlights have a mind of their own. They blink in Morse code sometimes, but only if you’re listening with your stomach.”

They lead you not toward the main avenues, but down a narrow alley where neon signs hum and flicker—not with advertisements, but with fragments of old poems: *“…and the river knows its name before the rain…”* and *“…you carry your home in your breath…”*

The group expands as you walk—adding a baker with flour-dusted apron, a teenager sketching pigeons in a notebook, an elderly woman carrying a harp strung with threads of light. They don’t all speak the same language, yet understand each other perfectly. When one places a warm *pain au chocolat* in your hand (even though you weren’t hungry), you realize: *this*—the kindness, the quiet cohesion—is the map you didn’t know you needed.

Finally, you reach a small square where a fountain glows with liquid moonlight. At its center floats a single paper boat, inscribed with your name in handwriting that looks like your own—but softer, older.

The silver-haired stranger nods toward it. “That’s how you know you’re not lost. You’re just… arriving.”

You step forward, and as your fingers brush the boat’s hull, the water parts—not like a miracle, but like an acknowledgment—and shows beneath it: a path of glowing cobblestones, winding upward through a city you’ve always dreamed of, where every street is named for a promise you once forgot you made to yourself.

You turn to thank them, but they’ve gone—except for a single feather on the cobblestone, iridescent and humming faintly.

You tuck it into your pocket, step onto the path, and walk home—not away from the city, but *into* it.

The dream ends not with waking, but with the quiet certainty that you’ll see them again—tonight, or tomorrow, or when the next streetlight blinks *…dot-dot-dot, dash…* “*Keep going.*”
