The air grows colder, the stone walls slick with a faint, phosphorescent moss that provides the only light. The last puzzle—a shifting lattice of celestial symbols that had to be aligned with the phases of an imagined moon—left your mind humming with a strange static. You solved it, but the silence that followed was heavier, more profound.

Ahead, the corridor ends not in a wall, but in a vast, circular chamber. In its center stands a single, pedestal made of obsidian. On it rests not a lock, nor a riddle inscribed on parchment, but a perfect, still pool of water, its surface black as the void.

As you approach, your own reflection does not appear. Instead, the water shows a scene: it’s your childhood bedroom, but viewed from the ceiling corner, watching your younger self sleep. The perspective is unsettling, familiar yet foreign.

A voice, not in the air but within the bones of the maze itself, vibrates through you. It asks not with words, but with a direct imprint of meaning:

**"To proceed, you must correct the dream. What is the wrongness here?"**

You stare into the pool. The details are exact—the faded dinosaur poster, the nightlight casting a galaxy on the wall, the rumpled comforter. The sleeping child’s chest rises and falls. Yet, a deep, logical chill runs through you. The puzzle isn't about the maze. It’s about *you*. The memory is flawless, which is the flaw.

*You never had a nightlight.*

The realization is the key. The maze isn't testing your knowledge of external patterns, but the integrity of your own mind. It’s presenting you with a perfect, implanted memory. To "correct the dream" is not to alter the scene, but to reject its false perfection.

You speak to the water, your voice steady. "The wrongness is the perspective. I am seeing a memory I could never have witnessed. This is not a memory; it is an observation. Remove the observer."

The pool shivers. The image of the bedroom dissolves into swirling ink, then clears. Now it shows only the bedroom, empty, from the perspective of the bed. It feels true. The obsidian pedestal sinks silently into the floor, and the far wall of the chamber irises open, revealing not another stone passage, but the soft, predawn light filtering through your own eyelids.

The final puzzle was the self. The solution was authenticity.

You wake.
