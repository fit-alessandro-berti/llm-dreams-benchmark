…figure out three things fast: where you are, what you can safely touch, and how not to look like someone who fell out of the sky.

The air smells wrong—too clean in a way that makes your throat itch, like smoke that isn’t there yet. Your eyes adjust and the world resolves into angles you’ve only ever seen in illustrations: low timber buildings with steep roofs, a dirt road rutted by wheels, and fences made from branches twisted together like hands clasping. Somewhere nearby, metal rings against metal, steady as a heartbeat.

You sit up—and immediately regret it. The ground is cold enough to bite through your clothes. Not just cold: damp, as if the earth is exhaling. You pat yourself down. No phone. No watch. No keys. Your pocket holds only lint and a single coin you don’t recognize, smooth as if it’s been worried by years of fingers.

A bell tolls. Not an electric chime—an actual bell, heavy and patient, calling the village into alignment.

You stand and try to walk like you belong in a world that doesn’t know what “belong” means. Your shoes look too clean. Your fabric looks too fine. A woman carrying a bundle of reeds glances at you and then away quickly, the way people look at smoke: not because it’s interesting, but because it means something else is about to happen.

You need a plan. The old kind.

You duck behind a stack of split logs and listen.

Voices pass. A man complains about the price of salt. Another says the river’s running low. Someone mentions “the reeve,” and the word lands in your mind like a latch clicking. Medieval. Or early modern. A place where a single wrong sentence can put you in a story you don’t want to be in.

You force yourself to stop thinking in years and start thinking in needs.

Water. Food. Shelter. A name.

And—because your brain won’t let it go—proof that you’re not dreaming. You pinch your forearm hard enough to sting. The sting stays. A crow lands on a fencepost, stares at you with one eye, and makes a sound that is not quite a caw—more like a laugh held back.

You step out onto the road.

The village is small, clustered around a square that is less a square than a widening of the road where people have agreed not to build. There’s a well with a wooden frame. A smithy with a low, dark mouth and the smell of hot iron. A chapel with a roof like folded hands. No glass in the windows—just oiled cloth, pale and trembling.

You approach the well, because everyone approaches the well sooner or later. A boy is drawing water, both hands on the crank, tongue between his teeth. You mimic what you’ve seen, take the bucket when it rises, and drink carefully. The water tastes like stone and something alive.

“Who’re you?” the boy asks, more curious than afraid.

You could lie quickly. You could tell the truth and be burned for it. You choose the only option that doesn’t require confidence.

“I got turned around,” you say. “I’m… looking for work.”

The boy squints at your clothes like they’re a trick. “Work’s for hands,” he says, and then, as if remembering he has a role to play, adds, “Ask at the inn.”

An inn. Of course. In dreams, there’s always an inn.

You follow the road to a building with a sagging sign that shows something that might once have been a stag. Inside, it’s dim and warm and smells like yeast and wet wool. Men sit with cups, shoulders hunched against a cold that seems to come from inside their bones. A dog lifts its head, decides you’re not food, and drops it again.

Behind the counter stands a woman with forearms like carved wood. She looks you over in a way that makes you feel as if your pockets are transparent.

“What do you want?” she asks.

“Work,” you repeat, and hear how thin it sounds.

She snorts. “Everyone wants work. What can you do?”

A list flashes through your mind—things that require electricity, things that require the internet, things that require tools that haven’t been invented. You swallow and pivot.

“I can read,” you say, because it’s a weapon in a world where most people can’t. And because it’s true no matter the century. “And I can count. And I learn fast.”

That gets you a different kind of look.

“Read?” she says, not skeptical—wary. “How well?”

You reach for something neutral and safe. “Signs. Notices. Letters.”

“Letters,” she repeats, and her gaze flicks to a corner you hadn’t noticed: a table with a man sitting alone, hood down, hair clipped close, hands clean in a way that marks him as someone who doesn’t dig or butcher. Ink stains his fingers. A clerk. A scribe. Someone attached to power.

The woman jerks her chin. “If you can read, he’ll want you. And if he wants you, you’d better be sure you want him.”

The man raises his head as if he felt the conversation like a change in air pressure. His eyes settle on you. They’re a pale gray that doesn’t quite match the rest of his face, and for a moment you get the unsettling impression you’ve met him before—somewhere between waking and sleep.

He gestures you over with one finger.

You walk to the table, every step suddenly loud.

He doesn’t offer a seat. “Name,” he says.

A name. You have yours, but it belongs to a world of plastic cards and email addresses. You need something that won’t snag.

“Alin,” you say, choosing a sound that feels old enough. It’s close to your real name without being it.

He nods as if he was expecting that. “Alin,” he repeats, and the way he says it feels like fastening a tag around your neck.

“What day is it?” you ask before you can stop yourself.

His mouth twitches. “Why?”

“I—” You glance around. Everyone else is pretending not to listen and failing. “I’ve been… traveling. I lost track.”

“The eve of Saint Bartholomew,” he says. “Year of our Lord—” He pauses, and for a breath you think he’s forgotten. Then he says the number clearly.

The number is wrong. Not in the sense that it’s a different year than you expected—wrong in the way a detail in a dream is wrong, like a clock that reads thirteen o’clock and everyone insists it’s normal.

You repeat it under your breath. Your skin prickles.

The scribe watches you do it and smiles as if you’ve confirmed something. “You’re not from here,” he says softly.

Your throat tightens. “Neither are you,” you say, because you don’t know why, but you feel it.

He leans forward. “Good,” he says. “Then we can speak plainly.”

The room seems to dim around the edges, as if the firelight is being pulled into the table between you.

“You need to survive,” he continues. “You’ll need coin, and a story. And you’ll need to stop asking questions that make men think of witches.”

You nod, because he’s right.

He taps the table once. “I can give you work. Carrying messages. Reading when needed. Listening.”

“Listening to what?”

His eyes flick to the window, where the sky outside has the flat color of pewter. “To the cracks,” he says. “To the places where the dream shows through.”

The word hits you like a slap: dream.

You laugh, too sharply, and it comes out as a cough. “This is a dream,” you say, not as a question.

The scribe’s expression doesn’t change. “Yes,” he says. “And no.”

Your hands are shaking now, so you fold them in your lap to keep them from showing it. “If this is my dream,” you whisper, “why don’t I control it?”

“Because you didn’t make it,” he says.

Silence expands between you. Somewhere a cup is set down. Somewhere the dog sighs.

You lean in. “Then whose dream is it?”

The scribe’s smile is thin as paper. “That,” he says, “is the part you need to remember.”

Remember. The word brings a sudden flash—an image so bright you almost flinch. A room full of humming machines. A screen. Your own hand reaching toward something. A warning you ignored. The sense of falling without moving.

Then it’s gone, leaving only the taste of iron at the back of your tongue.

The scribe stands. “Come,” he says, as if you’ve already agreed. “If you’re going to be here, you might as well be useful.”

He leads you out of the inn and down a narrow lane behind the chapel. The village thins into gardens and sheds and then into a stand of trees. The forest is close, pressing in, as if it’s been waiting.

You walk until the sound of the village fades and all you hear is leaves and your own breathing.

At last he stops beside a stone that looks like any other stone—mossy, half-buried, ordinary.

Except the air around it feels… wrong. Thicker. Like the moment before a headache.

“This is one of them,” the scribe says. “A seam.”

“A seam between what and what?”

He looks at you with a kind of tired patience. “Between where you came from,” he says, “and where you woke up.”

You step closer. Your skin rises in gooseflesh. The moss on the stone shivers, though there’s no wind.

“Put your hand on it,” he instructs.

Every instinct says no. Every other instinct—curiosity, desperation, the human need to touch the edge of things—says yes.

You press your palm to the stone.

It’s warm.

Not sun-warm. Body-warm.

A sound floods your ears, like distant traffic heard through water. Light flickers behind your eyes: a streetlamp, a phone screen, a microwave timer counting down. The smell of rain on asphalt. The taste of coffee. Your name being called in a voice you recognize, urgent and fading.

You gasp and pull back, heart hammering.

The scribe watches you carefully. “You felt it,” he says. “Good. That means you’re not stuck.”

“Then how do I get back?” you ask, the words tumbling out.

He looks past you into the trees. “That depends,” he says. “On whether you woke up by accident… or whether someone pulled you here.”

A branch snaps somewhere deeper in the forest. Not the small snap of a bird landing. The deliberate snap of weight shifting.

The scribe’s head turns slightly. “We’re not alone,” he murmurs.

Your mouth goes dry. “Who’s there?”

Something moves between the trunks, just at the edge of sight, where the world is always least trustworthy. A shape too tall, too still. It feels less like a person and more like an absence wearing a person’s outline.

The air drops colder. Your breath fogs.

The scribe steps in front of you—not protectively, exactly, but as if he knows where the lines are drawn. “Don’t run,” he says under his breath. “It likes that.”

“It?” you whisper.

The shape takes one slow step closer. The forest seems to lean toward it, listening.

And then, from somewhere behind you, from the direction of the village, a bell begins to ring again—faster this time, frantic, as if someone has grabbed the rope with both hands and is yanking the world awake.

The sound cuts through the cold like a blade. The shape hesitates.

The scribe’s hand closes around your wrist. “Now,” he says.

“Now what?”

He looks at you, eyes hard. “Now you decide,” he says. “Do you want to wake up—”

The bell’s clamor swells, and the stone beneath your palm seems to pulse, as if it has a heartbeat that matches the ringing.

“—or do you want to understand why you’re here?”

The shape in the trees tilts its head, listening to your answer.

And in that moment, with the bell shaking the air and the seam in the world warming under your skin, you realize you need to do something you’ve never had to do in any other dream:

Choose what happens next.
