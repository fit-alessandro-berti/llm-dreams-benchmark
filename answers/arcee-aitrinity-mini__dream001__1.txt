The dream continues:

**You start to panic, the unfamiliar signs and endless streets spinning around you. Sweat beads on your forehead as you pull out your phone, desperately searching for any signal. It flickers, showing a map, but the language is gibberish and the location pins are all offline. You try calling the meeting place, but your call goes straight to voicemail. The ticking of your watch echoes loudly in the silence.**

**Just as despair starts to set in, you notice an elderly woman sitting on a nearby bench, her eyes kind but wise. She looks up as you approach, gesturing towards a nearby café you hadn't seen before.**

*"Lost, my dear?"* she asks gently, her voice carrying a hint of amusement.

*"Yes!"* you gasp, relief washing over you. *"I have an important meeting in an hour, but I don't know where it is!"*

*"Ah, the Grand Bazaar Meeting Hall,"* she says, pointing a gnarled finger. *"You need to head north, past the fountain with the singing fish. Look for the building with the giant clock tower on the roof. The clock chimes every hour. Find that, and you'll find your way."*

*"Thank you!"* you exclaim, the urgency momentarily forgotten in gratitude. *"How do I find the fountain with the singing fish?"*

*"Follow the smell of spices,"* she advises, a small smile playing on her lips. *"It leads straight there."*

**With renewed purpose, you push through the crowds, the map in your head now guided by the woman's instructions. The scent of exotic spices grows stronger, confirming you're on the right track. You spot the fountain, its stone fish seemingly spouting water into the air. Nearby, the unmistakable silhouette of a large, ornate clock tower with a copper face rises above the bustling streets. You quicken your pace, the memory of the woman's words anchoring you, hoping you haven't missed the meeting entirely.**

The dream fades as you reach the entrance of the Grand Bazaar Meeting Hall, the clock tower looming large before you.
