...start to panic as I look at the project specs on the desk in front of me. It's a massive report that needs to be completed in 24 hours, with a presentation to a high-level client scheduled for the next afternoon. I glance around the office, feeling a sense of panic rising as I realize I'll never be able to finish it on time.

Suddenly, I'm standing on a cliff, staring out at a vast expanse of white space. I'm holding a pen, and the sky above me is filled with floating words, queries, and deadlines. I feel like I'm being pulled towards the horizon, with no safety net or anchor to hold onto...
