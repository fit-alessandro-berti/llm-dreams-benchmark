You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to wander the neon-lit streets, skyscrapers twisting like impossible spirals into a bruised purple sky. The air hums with distant chatter in languages that shift and melt mid-sentence. Panic bubbles up, but then a glowing map unfurls from your palm like liquid gold, pulsing with veins of light.

It doesn't show addresses—just symbols: a crow with a key in its beak, a clock melting into a river, your own face grinning back upside down. You follow the crow symbol down an alley where walls breathe, exhaling warm fog that smells of forgotten coffee. Street vendors hawk jars of bottled laughter and pocket-sized storms. A woman with eyes like shattered mirrors hands you a ticket: "For the meeting of fates. Don't be late."

The map leads to a revolving door at the base of a tower that wasn't there a moment ago. You step through, and suddenly you're in a vast boardroom orbiting the moon. Suited figures with animal heads—wolf, owl, fox—turn to you, their briefcases spilling stars. "You're just in time," the owl intones, sliding a contract across the table. It's written in your handwriting, dated tomorrow.

You sign, and the room spins. The city reappears below, but now it's yours—every street a vein in your dream-hand. The meeting? It was always with yourself. You wake up clutching your phone, the alarm blaring: one hour until your real meeting. But the map's glow lingers faintly on your skin.
