...and the sense of direction immediately begins to dissolve.

The first group you encounter is clustered around a mahogany serving table. They are discussing mortgages, but every single person is wearing an identical, perfectly preserved, fox-fur stole, regardless of gender. They speak in unison, their voices echoing slightly as if recorded in a large, tiled room. When you try to ask if they've seen your acquaintance, they pivot in perfect synchronicity, their faces obscured by the shadows cast by their excessive headwear.

“The percentage point remains volatile,” they chant, entirely ignoring your question.

You try to move around them, but the room itself seems to shift. You slip through a doorway and find yourself in a hallway that is slightly too narrow, smelling strongly of old chalk and rain.

Here, the next group is engaged in a silent, intense game. They are seated in uncomfortable, straight-backed chairs, meticulously counting tiny, polished glass beads into separate piles. They wear deep indigo cloaks, and the light reflects off the beads, creating dazzling, painful flashes. You whisper an apology as you try to pass, but the nearest player grabs your wrist. His skin is cold and papery.

“You have disturbed the tally,” he hisses, though his lips do not move. He points a long, accusatory finger down the hallway toward a set of double doors draped in heavy velvet. “Your friend went that way, but you cannot cross until the total is reconciled. One thousand, one hundred, and ninety-three.”

You peer down the hallway. The double doors are retreating—they are becoming smaller even as you stare at them, shrinking until they look like a child’s toy left abandoned in a massive, empty space. You panic, trying to pull your arm free, but the man’s grip tightens.

Suddenly, the counting stops. The indigo-cloaked figures look up at you, not with curiosity, but with a profound and exhausting disappointment.

“You are wearing the wrong shoes for this geometry,” declares a woman, whose hair is made entirely of dry straw. “They betray your true intentions.”

You glance down, realizing your shoes are indeed incorrect—one is a stiff black boot, and the other is a soft, brightly colored slipper—yet you swear you put on a matching pair before arriving.

You yank your arm free and stumble backward, the hall dissolving into a space that feels less like a room and more like a loud, persistent ringing noise. You emerge into a brightly lit space resembling an indoor garden, filled with plastic ferns and harsh fluorescent light.

The final group is standing near a water feature shaped like a stylized whale. This group is laughing, a high, brittle sound that seems to peel the paint from the walls. You finally spot a familiar silhouette in the center of the crowd—it must be the person you know! Relief washes over you, but before you can call out, you realize they are surrounded by six people, all dressed in formal, vintage snorkeling gear. They are passing your friend back and forth, turning them slowly like an object being analyzed.

You push forward, desperate, only to realize that the person in the middle is not your friend at all. It is a mannequin wearing your friend’s distinctive coat, and stitched onto its face is a photograph of you from ten years ago—a photograph you believed you had destroyed.

The group in snorkeling gear stops laughing, and the harsh sound of their breathing through their plastic mouthpieces is the only sound in the room. They all turn their opaque, glass faces toward you.

One of them points toward the exit, which is now a very small, perfectly square hole cut into the wall, too high to reach and too dark to see into.

"The party is over," one of them rasps, the voice muffled and wet. "You have achieved maximum observation."

You try to speak, to protest, but your voice comes out as a weak, watery chirp, and as you look down at your hands, you see they are now covered in fine, white beach sand. The sand begins to pour off your fingers, sinking into the plastic ferns, and the entire brightly lit room tilts sharply toward the darkness of the small, square hole. You feel yourself losing purchase on the floor, sliding toward the void, pulled by the insistent, low gravity of the sand.
