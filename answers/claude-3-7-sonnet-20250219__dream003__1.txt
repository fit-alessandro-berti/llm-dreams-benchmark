You are dreaming. I'll continue this dream sequence for you:

You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and symbols etched into its dark wooden surface. Your fingers trace the delicate carvings—spiraling constellations, ancient runes, and what appears to be a map of some forgotten place.

As moonlight filters through your window, it catches the box at just the right angle. The patterns begin to shimmer with an otherworldly blue glow. You feel a strange warmth emanating from within, pulsing like a heartbeat.

Instinctively, you press your palm against a circular design at the center. The wood beneath your hand seems to soften, and you feel the box responding to your touch. The symbols rearrange themselves, sliding across the surface like liquid mercury, converging toward your fingertips.

A melodic hum fills the room as seams appear where there were none before. The box doesn't open—it unfolds, each panel blossoming outward like a geometric flower revealing its secrets.

Inside isn't an object but a miniature cosmos—swirling galaxies, twinkling stars, and cosmic dust suspended in the air above the box. The universe in miniature rotates slowly, casting dancing lights across your face and the walls of your room.

A voice whispers from everywhere and nowhere: "The key was always within you. What would you like to know?"
