panic for a moment, your heart racing as you look around at the towering buildings and bustling streets. The air smells faintly of rain, and the sound of distant thunder rumbles in the background. You clutch the crumpled piece of paper with the address scribbled on it, but the words seem to blur together as if mocking your confusion.

A stranger walks by—a tall woman wearing a long coat—and you hesitate before calling out to her. She stops mid-step and turns toward you, her expression calm but curious. "Can you help me?" you ask, showing her the address. Her eyes scan the paper briefly before she nods. "I know where that is," she says, surprising you with how confident she sounds. 

She begins walking briskly down the street without another word, clearly expecting you to follow. You quicken your pace to keep up with her, weaving through crowds of people who all seem to be moving with purpose. As you trail behind her, you notice small details about the city: neon signs flickering above shop windows, steam rising from grates in the sidewalk, and the rhythmic clatter of bicycles zipping past.

The woman leads you into an older part of the city where the skyscrapers give way to brick buildings with ornate carvings. Here, time seems slower, quieter. She gestures toward a narrow alleyway tucked between two structures. "Go this way," she says, her voice barely audible over the soft patter of rain starting to fall. Before you can thank her or even ask why she's helping, she disappears into the crowd as though she was never there.

You step cautiously into the alley, which feels eerily quiet compared to the chaos outside. At its end stands a door made of dark wood, unmarked except for a brass knocker shaped like a crescent moon. Something tells you this is the place, despite the lack of signage. Your hand trembles slightly as you lift the knocker and tap it against the door three times.

The door creaks open almost immediately, revealing a dimly lit room filled with rows of tables covered in strange objects—clocks without hands, books bound in leather that glows faintly, and vials containing liquids that shift colors when moved. A figure emerges from the shadows, their face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. They speak, their voice low and measured, "You're right on time." 

But just as they extend their hand to greet you, the scene dissolves, replaced by the familiar ceiling of your bedroom. You sit up, gasping, realizing it was all a dream. Yet, the image of the mysterious room lingers in your mind, leaving you wondering if perhaps some dreams hold more than mere imagination...
