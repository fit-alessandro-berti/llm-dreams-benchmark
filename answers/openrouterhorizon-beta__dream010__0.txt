…each one seems tailored to expose a hidden strength you didn’t know you had.

First, you’re in a vast atrium made of glass and light, where the judges ask you to build something meaningful out of a pile of mismatched objects: a compass, a paper crane, a cracked hourglass, a key without a door. Time is dripping from the hourglass in glimmering threads, and when it hits the floor it turns into tiny silver fish that swim around your shoes. You feel the old panic rise—there’s no blueprint, no rules. But your hands move anyway. You tie the compass to the crane’s beak with a filament of time-fish, pour the last grains of sand into the crane’s hollow paper belly, and slide the key through its folded wings. When you release it, the crane lifts and circles the room, pointing its compass toward a door that wasn’t there before. Applause blooms like warm rain. You realize you didn’t build a thing—you built a direction.

Next, you’re ushered into a library that smells like cedar and thunderstorms. The books hum, and when you open one, its words float up as soft moths. Your challenge is to find a story that can calm a crowd outside, though you can’t see them and don’t know what scares them. You listen to the moths’ wingbeats—some frantic, some steady—and choose the ones that sound like home. You gather them into your hands and step to the balcony. The crowd is a sea of silhouettes, faces unreadable. You release the moths, and they rearrange themselves into constellations that spell out a memory: the time you almost gave up, and didn’t. The silhouettes draw closer, edges gaining color. Someone laughs. Someone sighs. The fear thins like fog in sunshine. You don’t speak a word, but the story lands anyway.

Then you’re on a narrow bridge suspended between two mountains at twilight, with a judge on each side asking contradictory questions at the same time. The wind carries their words back and forth, tangling them into a knot. Choose, they say. Choose fast. Your old instinct is to race, to split yourself, to please everyone. But the bridge sings—thin metal strings, almost music—and you kneel to listen. Beneath the questions, you hear a single note you recognize, the one that feels like truth in your sternum. You hum it back, and the wind quiets to hear you. The judges lower their clipboards, and the questions simplify into one: What matters most? You answer without rush. The bridge tightens under your feet, sturdy, as if surprised you finally trusted it.

Later, there’s a labyrinth made of mirrors. At first you try not to look, because every reflection is a version of you auditioning for someone else’s approval—smiling too wide, speaking too fast, shrinking. The task is to find the center. You keep hitting glass. You start leaving small marks with your fingertip, little fogged crescents where your breath touched the surface. Eventually you notice something—one reflection isn’t mimicking you perfectly. When you tilt your head, it lags, then catches up. You face it and ask, softly, What do you want? The glass warms. A seam appears and opens like a quiet mouth. You step through. In the center is not a prize, but a desk with a window. Outside, dawn. Inside, a chair that’s the exact height where your feet touch the ground comfortably. You sit. It feels like relief.

The final challenge happens in a room with no corners. The judges are gone. It’s just you and a clock with no hands. A voice—your own, older—asks you to describe the job you’ve dreamed of without using any job titles. You start to say the names you’ve rehearsed, but they drop away like coats that are too heavy. You try again: I want mornings with purpose and evenings with enough energy to love the people I love. I want to solve real problems with both my brain and my heart. I want to make complicated things clear so others feel less alone. I want to build maps where there weren’t any and then walk them with whoever needs to go. As you speak, the handless clock begins to glow from within until it’s a full, round sun. The light folds into your pockets, your sleeves, a warmth you can carry.

A door appears. On it hangs a tag with your name written in your own handwriting—the way you wrote it when you were ten, looping and bold. You reach for the knob, but before you turn it, you look back at the empty room. It doesn’t feel empty anymore. It feels like a place you could return to if you ever forget.

You open the door.

You are stepping onto a stage and also into an office and also into a studio, all the same space—your space. The judges are in the front row, but they aren’t judges now. They’re future collaborators, past mentors, strangers who will one day send grateful emails. Someone smiles and says, We’ve been waiting for you. There’s a desk with a lamp that turns on with a touch. There’s a whiteboard already half-filled with questions that make your pulse quicken. There’s a plant that is somehow the child of every backyard tree you loved growing up. Your tools are arranged exactly as if you had placed them there yesterday.

You realize the “grand prize” isn’t a job handed from above; it’s permission you finally give yourself. You take a breath that lands deep and steady. The air tastes like possibility and peppermint. The first task is already on the table, patient and bright.

You roll up your sleeves, and the dream job begins as you begin it—by choosing, by building, by telling the true story out loud. Outside, somewhere, a paper crane taps against the window, pointing you where to go next.
