the sky darkens dramatically, the once calm air now filled with the eerie howl of the wind. The trees around you, once gently swaying, now bend and twist as if in pain, their leaves rustling ominously. You quicken your pace, hoping to find shelter before the storm hits, but the forest seems to be closing in around you, the path narrowing and the trees growing closer with each step.

As you continue to walk, you notice something strange—through the thickening fog, you see a faint light flickering in the distance. It’s not the kind of light you’d expect from a campfire or a house; it’s softer, almost ethereal, and it seems to be coming from deeper within the forest. Your heart races, a mix of fear and curiosity urging you forward.

The storm grows closer, the thunder rolling like a distant drumbeat, but the light continues to guide you, drawing you deeper into the heart of the forest. The air is thick with the scent of rain and something else—something unfamiliar, like the musty smell of ancient secrets.

You reach a clearing, and there, in the center, stands an old, weathered cabin, its roof covered in moss and its windows boarded up. But it’s the light that draws your attention—it’s coming from inside, glowing warmly through the cracks in the walls. The storm is now just overhead, the first drops of rain beginning to fall, but the cabin remains untouched, as if protected by some unseen force.

You approach the door, your hand trembling as you reach for the rusty knob. It turns easily, creaking softly as you push it open. The inside is dark, but the light you saw from outside seems to be emanating from a single, small lamp on a table in the corner. The room is filled with old, dusty furniture, cobwebs hanging from the ceiling, and the air is thick with the scent of aged wood and something else—something sweet, like incense.

As you step inside, the door creaks shut behind you, and the storm outside seems to fade away, the rain stopping as quickly as it began. The light from the lamp flickers, casting strange shadows on the walls, and you feel a presence in the room, as if someone—or something—is watching you.

You take a step forward, your breath caught in your throat, and as you do, the lamp suddenly goes out, plunging the room into darkness. For a moment, you’re blind, your eyes struggling to adjust to the sudden absence of light. But then, from the corner of your eye, you see a figure moving in the shadows—a figure that seems to be made of the same fog that surrounds you.

You turn to face it, but as you do, the figure dissolves into the air, leaving you alone in the dark, the only sound the distant rumble of the storm that has now moved on, leaving the forest in an eerie silence.

And then, just as suddenly as it began, the dream fades, leaving you with a sense of unease and a lingering question: What was that light, and why did it draw you here?
