…decide to step back, take a deep breath, and say the one thing I swore I’d never say out loud.

The room tilts. The walls melt like candle wax, colors bleeding into each other until your friend’s face is a watercolor smear of anger and hurt. You hear your own voice, but it’s coming from somewhere far away, echoing inside a seashell:

“I’m terrified you’re right.”

The moment the words leave your mouth, gravity forgets its job. The floor drops out from under both of you, and suddenly you’re falling upward into a night sky made of old photographs (every fight you ever had, every inside joke, every 3 a.m. phone call when one of you was breaking). They flutter past like confused birds.

Your friend reaches out, no longer angry, just wide-eyed and reaching. You grab their hand. The photos swirl into a single Polaroid that hasn’t finished developing yet. It’s blank except for a faint outline of two silhouettes holding hands.

You realize the argument was never about who was right. It was about whether there would still be an “us” on the other side of being wrong.

The Polaroid finally develops. In it, you’re both laughing so hard you’re crying, sitting on the hood of a car that doesn’t exist anymore, passing a warm beer back and forth under a sky that looks exactly like this one.

You wake up before you hit the ground, heart hammering, phone already in your hand with an unsent message that just says:

you up? i was an asshole. can we talk?
