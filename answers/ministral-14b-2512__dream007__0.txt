**Dream Continuation:**

The air between you and your friend is thick with tension, each word sharp as broken glass. You’ve reached the point where silence feels louder than shouting—so you take a deep breath and say, *"I don’t want to lose you over this. But I also can’t just agree with you when it feels wrong to me."*

Your friend’s eyes flash, but their voice drops to something raw, almost desperate. *"Then what do you want me to do? Walk away? Pretend this doesn’t matter?"* Their hands clench at their sides, fingers trembling.

For a moment, the world around you blurs—the walls of the room seem to stretch, the colors bleeding into something surreal. You realize, with a jolt, that this isn’t just an argument anymore. It’s a *test*. Not of your friendship, but of something deeper: your ability to hold space for truth *and* love at the same time.

You reach out, not to grab their arm, but to cup your hand over their fist. *"I’m not asking you to walk away. I’m asking you to listen—not just to my words, but to the *why* behind them. Because if we can’t do that, then what’s left?"*

Their breath hitches. The tension doesn’t vanish, but it shifts—like a storm cloud parting just enough to let in a sliver of light. Your friend’s voice cracks. *"What if I’m wrong?"*

You smile, soft and tired. *"Then we’ll figure it out together. But we won’t know unless we try."*

And then—

The dream *twists*. The room dissolves into a vast, empty landscape, the sky a swirl of violet and gold. You’re standing on a bridge made of something fragile and luminous, like spun sugar or starlight. Your friend is still there, but their face is half-shadow, half-memory. *"You always were the one who believed in bridges,"* they say, and their voice echoes like a whisper from another life.

You look down. The water below isn’t water—it’s a mirror, but the reflection isn’t yours. It’s *both* of you, standing side by side, younger, unbroken. The bridge trembles. *"Do you think we’ll remember this?"* you ask.

Your friend laughs, but it’s the sound of wind through dry grass. *"Some things don’t need to be remembered. They just… are."*

And then you wake up—

—with the taste of honey and rain on your tongue, and the strange certainty that the argument wasn’t over at all. It was only beginning.
