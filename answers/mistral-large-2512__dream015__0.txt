**The Last Garden**

The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and rusted metal as you kneel in the cracked soil of what was once a city park. Around you, the skeletal remains of skyscrapers loom like broken teeth against a bruised sky, their windows long shattered, their steel bones groaning in the wind. But here, in this small patch of land, something defies the ruin.

You’ve been tending this garden for months.

At first, it was just a desperate experiment—a handful of seeds salvaged from a looted grocery store, a few stolen hours of sunlight between raids. But now, against all odds, green shoots push through the dirt. Tomatoes swell on vines, their skins taut with ripeness. Carrots hide beneath the soil, waiting to be pulled. A single apple tree, stunted but stubborn, clings to life in the corner, its branches heavy with fruit.

You don’t know how long it will last. The soil is poisoned in places, the water rationed. Raiders come at night, drawn by the scent of life in a dead world. And then there are the *others*—the ones who don’t just take, but *watch*. The ones who follow you from the shadows, their eyes hollow, their hands twitching like they’ve forgotten how to hold anything but a blade.

But today, the garden is yours.

You pluck a ripe tomato, its warmth bleeding into your palm. The juice runs down your wrist as you take a bite, the taste so bright, so *alive*, that for a moment, you forget the hunger, the fear, the weight of the pistol at your hip.

Then you hear it—a twig snapping.

You freeze. The wind carries the sound again, closer this time. Not an animal. Not the wind.

Someone is here.

You reach for the knife at your belt, your fingers brushing the worn leather of the sheath. The garden suddenly feels too small, the shadows too deep. You scan the tree line, your breath shallow.

And then—

A child steps into the light.

She can’t be more than ten, her face smudged with dirt, her clothes patched and too big for her thin frame. Her eyes are wide, locked onto the tomato in your hand. She doesn’t speak. Doesn’t move. Just stares, like she’s afraid you’ll vanish if she blinks.

You lower the knife.

“You hungry?” you ask.

She nods.

You break the tomato in half and hold it out to her. She hesitates, then takes it, her fingers trembling. She devours it in two bites, juice dripping down her chin. When she’s done, she looks at you, and for the first time in years, you see something in her eyes that isn’t fear.

Hope.

Then, from the ruins behind her, a voice cuts through the silence.

*“There you are.”*

A man steps forward, his rifle slung over his shoulder, his face half-hidden beneath a tattered hood. He’s not one of the raiders. Not one of the feral ones. He moves like he knows how to use that gun, like he’s used to being obeyed.

The girl flinches.

You stand, placing yourself between them.

“She’s with me,” you say.

The man’s gaze flicks to the garden, then back to you. A slow smile spreads across his face, but it doesn’t reach his eyes.

“Funny,” he says. “I was about to say the same thing about *you*.”

Behind him, more figures emerge from the ruins. Not raiders. Not scavengers.

*Soldiers.*

Their uniforms are faded, their patches torn, but the insignia is unmistakable—the last remnants of a government that fell years ago. The man in front steps closer, his boots crunching on broken glass.

“We’ve been watching you,” he says. “That garden. The way you move. You’re not just surviving. You’re *thriving*.”

You tighten your grip on the knife.

“What do you want?”

His smile widens.

“We want you to come with us. There’s a place—a real place. Walls. Power. A future.” He gestures to the girl. “We can take her too. Keep her safe.”

The girl shrinks back, pressing against your leg.

You look at the garden. The tomatoes. The apple tree. The fragile, impossible life you’ve carved out of the ashes.

Then you look at the soldiers. The guns. The promises that sound too much like chains.

You make your choice.

“No.”

The man’s smile falters.

“You don’t understand. This isn’t an offer. It’s an order.”

You don’t answer. Instead, you turn to the girl.

“Run,” you whisper.

And then the world explodes in gunfire.

**How does the dream continue?**
- **Do you fight?** (The soldiers are better armed, but you know these ruins better than they do.)
- **Do you flee?** (The girl is fast, but the soldiers have vehicles. The garden will be lost.)
- **Do you bargain?** (What do you have that they want more than obedience?)
- **Or does something else happen entirely?** (A storm rolls in. The earth shakes. The garden *moves*.)

The choice is yours. The dream isn’t over yet.
