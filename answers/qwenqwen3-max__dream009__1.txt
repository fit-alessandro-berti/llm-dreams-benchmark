...find a way to survive—but not just survive. You need to *belong*.

The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth. You’re standing at the edge of a village nestled in a valley, surrounded by thatched cottages with walls of wattle and daub. Chickens peck at the dirt path; a cow lows softly from a nearby pen. People in rough-spun wool tunics glance your way, their eyes sharp with curiosity and caution. Your modern clothes—jeans, a cotton T-shirt, sneakers—mark you as utterly out of place.

Your stomach growls. You have no food, no coin, no language that fits. Panic claws at your throat, but you force it down. Observe. Adapt.

An elderly woman with hands gnarled like tree roots is stirring a cauldron over an open fire. She catches your eye and nods once—briefly, but not unkindly. You approach, hands open, palms up in a universal gesture of need. She studies you for a long moment, then points to a bucket by the well.

“Fetch,” she says in a dialect that sounds like Old English, but somehow, in this dream-logic, you understand.

You haul water, your arms trembling with the weight. She watches, then gestures for you to sit. She ladles a thin stew into a wooden bowl and offers it. It’s bland but warm, and you eat ravenously.

Later, as dusk falls, she beckons you inside her cottage. Over the firelight, she shows you how to grind grain with a hand quern, how to weave reeds into mats, how to read the sky for weather. She doesn’t ask where you’re from—only what you can do.

And so you learn. You mend fences. You help tend the sheep. You listen more than you speak. Weeks pass. Seasons turn.

One morning, the village gathers for a feast. They’ve made room for you at the long table. The elder places a woven bracelet on your wrist—dyed with woad, the color of midnight. It means “one of us.”

You realize then: you don’t need to return. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

Because in this dream, you’ve found something modern life never gave you—a place where your hands matter, your presence is seen, and your silence is enough.

The sun rises over the barley fields, golden and slow. You breathe deep. And for the first time, you’re home.
