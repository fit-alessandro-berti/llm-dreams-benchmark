I'm sitting at my desk, staring blankly at my computer screen as my boss's voice echoes in my head, "I need this report on my desk by the end of the day. It's a top-priority project, and I expect nothing but perfection."

As I try to process the impossible deadline, my phone starts ringing nonstop. It's my coworkers, asking for help with their own projects, and the IT department, alerting me to a system crash. I feel a wave of panic wash over me as I frantically try to jot down notes on the project details, but my pen keeps running out of ink, and my paper is filled with scribbles that make no sense.

Just as I'm about to give up, I glance around the office and notice that all my coworkers have transformed into cartoon characters. They're all busy working on their own projects, some even juggling multiple tasks at once. One of them starts to juggle three inflatables, and another is tapping away on a typewriter that's embedded in a toilet seat (don't ask).

I try to join in, attempting to tap out a coherent report on my own keyboard, but the letters start changing to Chinese characters, then emojis, and eventually, just scribbles again. The screen starts to warp and contort, and I feel like I'm trying to type with my feet.

Meanwhile, my boss has morphed into a canyon explorer with a torch, scaling the walls of the office and leaving a trail of energetically scribbled post-it notes in their wake. I desperately try to read them, but they dissolve into cashier receipts and my horoscope for the week.

...Suddenly, I'm sliding through a sea of highlighters and mismatched socks, and everything dissolves into a rave party where everyone is dancing to a cacophony of buzzing file cabinets and typing keyboard sounds. Am I truly awake?
