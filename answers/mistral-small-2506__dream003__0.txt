symbols etched into the surface—some resembling ancient constellations, others like forgotten runes. The box hums faintly, as if alive, and the air around it shimmers with an unnatural warmth.

Curious, you trace your fingers over the symbols, and suddenly, the box *shifts* in your hands—its edges softening like liquid metal. The lock clicks open on its own, revealing a swirling void inside. A whisper echoes from the darkness: *"Take what you seek, but beware the cost."*

Your hand hesitates. Do you reach in?

If you do, the void *pulls* at you, and your fingers brush against something cold and smooth—a small, silver key. But as you grasp it, the box *screams*, and the symbols flare to life, burning into your skin like brands. The key vanishes, and the box slams shut, now covered in your own reflection—but your eyes are hollow, staring back at you.

Or perhaps you *don’t* reach in. Instead, you set the box down, and it begins to *grow*, its surface splitting open like a blooming flower. Inside, a single, perfect black rose unfurls, its petals made of starlight. It hums a lullaby in a language you’ve never heard but somehow understand.

The dream shifts again. The rose dissolves into mist, and you’re standing in a vast library, shelves stretching into infinity. The box is gone, but the key—now made of bone—rests on a pedestal. A voice (your own?) murmurs: *"The answer was never the box. It was always you."*

What happens next?

(You decide.)
