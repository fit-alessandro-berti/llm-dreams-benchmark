…secure the basics of survival before you can hope to understand where—or when—you are.

You pinch yourself. No phone buzzing in your pocket, no hum of electricity, no hint of pavement underfoot. Instead, cool grass brushes your ankles, and the dawn light filters through a stand of ancient oaks. In the distance, you hear the lowing of cattle and the far-off clang of a blacksmith’s hammer. Hunger twists your stomach; water from the morning mist beads on your lips.

You realize you need to:

1. Find fresh water.  
   Walking downhill, you follow the faint sound of running water until you reach a narrow stream edged with pebbles. Kneeling, you cup your hands and drink deeply, tasting the earth and moss. The cold liquid sharpens your senses.

2. Acquire clothing that won’t draw suspicion.  
   You spot a nearby settlement—simple wooden huts with thatched roofs. Peering around a corner, you see a laundry line strung between poles, patched homespun garments flapping in the breeze. You slip behind a woodpile, swap your modern shirt for a coarse linen tunic, and fold your jeans into a bundle. Instantly, you feel more a part of this time.

3. Learn enough of the local tongue.  
   As you enter the hamlet, a child stops to play with a stick in the dirt, pointing it at you and laughing. The villagers speak in clipped syllables you barely recognize. You catch a woman’s whispered greeting—“God y’ good morrow, stranger”—and realize that understanding even a few phrases will keep you safe. You nod, press your folded bundle into her hands in thanks, and steel yourself to ask, “Swilch wat’r so?”—“Where is the well?”

4. Secure shelter and an ally.  
   A grizzled farmer named Alric notices your accent and wary stance. He offers a night’s lodging in his stable in exchange for helping mend broken fencing. You agree, heart pounding. As you hammer splintered posts back into place, he tells you tales of bandits on the road north and rumors of strange lights in the forest. Something about the way he eyes you suggests he might help you find answers—or expose you to dangers you’ve yet to imagine.

By sunset, you’re leaning against a barn wall, cleaning a rusted nail-puller with a scrap of cloth. You look up at a sky free of contrails and satellites and realize that in this world, every scrap of knowledge is hard-won—and that your own ingenuity has become your greatest weapon. Tomorrow you’ll explore the market, seek news of a traveling scholar rumored to be studying “celestial anomalies,” and begin to piece together how this realm of axes and arcane lore connects to the life you left behind. But tonight, you let the earthy scent of hay and hearth settle around you, and you prepare—mind, body, and spirit—for whatever comes next.
