As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and realize they aren't just decorative—they shift and flow under your gaze, responding to your attention. A faint hum rises from the box, and the patterns begin to glow with a soft, blue light.  

You reach out, not with your hand, but with a thought, and the patterns rearrange themselves into a familiar shape—the outline of a key you lost long ago. The lock clicks open without being touched.  

Inside, there is no object, only a deep, star-filled darkness… and the clear, resonant sound of a bell ringing once, far away. You understand, without knowing how, that the box didn't contain something—it was containing something. And now it's free.  

You wake with the echo of that bell still ringing in your ears, and a strange, quiet certainty that you’ve unlocked a part of yourself you’d forgotten was closed.
