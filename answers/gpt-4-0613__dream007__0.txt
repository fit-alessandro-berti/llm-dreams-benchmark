step outside to clear your head. The crisp air of the night and the silence glimmering beneath the city lights gives you a moment to reflect. As you sit there, feeling the cold seep into your jacket, you find yourself transported to a completely different location. You are now standing on top of a mountain, covered in ash. The air smells of ember and smoke.

Suddenly, the skies turn red and a humongous dragon descends upon the mountaintop, its scales shimmering in a strange spectrum of colors. It stares at you with piercing eyes, and surprisingly, you do not feel fear. Instead, you feel a strange sense of peace and tranquility which feels somewhat at odds with the tumultuous setting.

The dragon opens its mouth, and you brace for fire, but instead a gentle, melodic voice speaks. "Why do you quarrel with a friend?" it asks, seeming genuinely interested.

"We have... differing views on something," you stammer, suddenly feeling very small.

"Is the dispute worth losing your friendship?" the dragon asks.

This question strikes a chord in you. Your argument had been heated and at times hurtful. Friendships are about compromise, understanding, and respect. Was your differing opinion really worth destroying that bond?

With a newfound resolution, you find yourself back in the city, fading lights glimmering in the distance. You re-enter your apartment, apology ready to roll off your tongue. As you approach your friend, the fiery eyes of the dragon and its question linger in your mind, serving as a reminder of the importance of friendship. And in that moment, you know that no disagreement is worth losing a cherished bond over.
