**Dream Sequence:**

You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour—but you have no idea where it is. You start to panic, your heart pounding as you scan the towering buildings around you. The streets are a maze of neon signs, flickering in a language you don’t recognize, and the air hums with the distant murmur of a crowd you can’t see.

A gust of wind sends a crumpled piece of paper tumbling at your feet. You pick it up—it’s a map, but the ink is smudged, and the streets twist into impossible shapes. A voice whispers from nowhere: *"The clock is ticking."*

You sprint down an alley, your shoes slapping against wet pavement. The city seems to shift around you—buildings stretch taller, shadows deepen, and the sky darkens unnaturally fast. A clock tower looms in the distance, its hands spinning backward. You check your watch—only 30 minutes left.

A stranger in a long coat steps into your path. "You’re looking for the meeting," they say, their face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. "But you’re not ready." Before you can respond, they vanish, leaving behind a single key on the ground.

You grab it, and suddenly, the city transforms. The streets rearrange themselves into a spiral, leading you toward a grand, ornate door. The key fits perfectly. As you turn it, the door creaks open—revealing a room filled with people in masks, all staring at you. A gong sounds.

The last thing you hear before waking is your own voice, whispering: *"I’m late."*

**You jolt awake, drenched in sweat, the dream still clinging to you like a second skin.**
