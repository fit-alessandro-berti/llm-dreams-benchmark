...and realize that the conversations around you aren't made of words, but of physical textures. 

As you brush past a circle of tall, slender strangers, their laughter feels like dry autumn leaves skittering against your skin. You apologize, but when you open your mouth, only a soft, blue light spills out. They don't seem to notice; they are too busy debating the geometry of a cloud that is currently hovering over the buffet table.

You scan the room for the one face you recognize—Julian. You see the back of his distinctive corduroy jacket near a fireplace where the flames are burning a silent, cool silver. You push through the crowd, but the floor has become unexpectedly soft, like walking on a giant loaf of unbaked bread. Every step requires a monumental effort of will.

"Julian!" you try to call out, but the name comes out as the scent of cedar and rain. 

You reach out to grab his shoulder, but as he turns, his face is a mosaic of shifting clock gears, all ticking in a frantic, polyrhythmic harmony. "You’re late," the gears chime in a voice that sounds like a cello. "The tide is coming in through the pantry."

You look down and see that the hem of your clothes is already damp. A slow, rhythmic pulse begins to thrum through the walls of the house, like a giant heart beating beneath the floorboards. The other guests begin to open umbrellas made of bird feathers, floating upward toward the vaulted ceiling as the room fills with waist-deep, shimmering violet water.

Through the translucent depths of the rising tide, you see a door at the bottom of the room that wasn't there before. It’s glowing with a warm, golden light—the exact color of the memory you have of Julian’s laugh. 

You realize you don't need to breathe. You dive.

As you swim toward the handle, the noise of the party fades into a profound, peaceful silence. You pull the door open and step through, not into another room, but onto a vast, empty salt flat under a sky filled with three moons. 

There, sitting on a single wooden chair in the middle of the infinite white expanse, is Julian. He isn't a clock anymore. He’s holding two halves of a pomegranate and looking at you with a small, knowing smile.

"I took the shortcut," he says, tossing you half of the fruit. 

As you catch it, you realize the fruit is heavy, warm, and pulsing. You look back, but the door—and the party, and the water—has vanished. There is only the wind, the salt, and the sudden, overwhelming realization that you forgot to wear shoes.

You start to laugh, and this time, the sound is exactly what it's supposed to be. 

Then, the moons begin to blink. One by one, the stars turn into the digital numbers of an alarm clock, glowing faintly in the dark. 

And you wake up.
