feel a wave of relief wash over you. Grateful for their kindness, you accept their offer, and they lead you through the crowded streets with ease. As you walk, their cheerful chatter fills the air, and the city that once seemed overwhelming now feels alive with possibility. They point out hidden gems—a cozy café tucked in an alley, a vibrant mural splashed across a brick wall—and you begin to see the beauty you’d missed before. 
Soon, you arrive at a familiar corner, and it dawns on you that you’re no longer lost. The strangers smile, wish you well, and fade into the crowd, leaving you with a renewed sense of confidence. You take a deep breath, ready to explore the city on your own terms, knowing that kindness can appear when you least expect it.
