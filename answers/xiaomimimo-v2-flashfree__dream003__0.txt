As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and **the faint, pulsing glow of lines that seem to shift and rearrange themselves, like constellations drifting across a midnight sky.**

The box is made of a cool, heavy material that isn't quite metal and isn't quite stone. It feels ancient. There is no visible keyhole, no latch, no hinge—only the endless, hypnotic dance of the lines.

As you trace one of the patterns with your fingertip, the box hums softly, vibrating against your skin. The lines brighten in response to your touch, flowing upward toward your hand like liquid light. The humming sound deepens, resonating in your chest, and the air around you feels charged with static.

Suddenly, the lines stop moving. They freeze in a shape that looks distinctly like a question mark. Then, without warning, the box speaks—not in words, but in a melody that plays directly inside your mind, asking you a riddle that you somehow already know the answer to, though you can't quite remember it yet.
