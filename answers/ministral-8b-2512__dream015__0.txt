In the cracked, sun-bleached ruins of what was once a city, the air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint, acrid tang of something burning—either the last embers of a long-dead fire or the distant, smoldering remains of a scavenger’s camp. The sky is a bruised canvas of storm clouds, their edges tinged with the sickly green of radiation or some other unseen poison. You’re dressed in patched-together rags, your boots caked in mud and the occasional scrap of glass, your hands calloused from years of work that never quite paid enough.

You’ve been walking for days, maybe weeks, since the last safe haven—*the Bunker*, as the survivors called it—fell to the raiders from the north. The world outside is a maze of skeletal buildings, their windows like hollow eyes staring at you. The few people you’ve seen have been either too weak to move, too desperate to fight, or too mad to care. The radio crackles in your pocket, but the only voices that come through are static and the occasional, eerie whisper of a dead broadcast: *"This is the last transmission from Station Alpha. Repeat, this is the last transmission—"*

You stop at the edge of a collapsed overpass, its metal ribs twisted like the bones of some great beast. Below, a river—once a highway for trade—now churns black with silt and the occasional floating corpse. The water is undrinkable, but the banks are lined with the husks of old cars, their doors hanging open like the jaws of some long-dead machine. You crouch, brushing away the dust from the dashboard of a rusted-out sedan. Inside, half-buried under a tarp, is a can of beans. *One can.* It’s dented, the label peeling, but the seal is intact. You pocket it, your stomach growling in protest.

Then you hear it.

A sound that isn’t quite human. A wet, clicking noise, like bones snapping underfoot. You freeze. The wind howls through the ruins, but the sound persists—*click-click-click*—coming from the shadows beneath the overpass. Your fingers tighten around the rusted pipe you’ve been carrying as a weapon. It’s not much, but it’s better than nothing.

You step forward, your breath shallow. The noise stops. Then, slowly, a figure emerges from the darkness. It’s tall, too tall, its limbs too long, its skin stretched too tight over jagged bones. Its face—if you can call it that—is a shifting mask of scars and stitches, its mouth a lipless gash that splits into a grin. But it’s not *alive*. Not anymore. Or maybe it never was. Its movements are jerky, unnatural, like a marionette with broken strings.

It raises a hand—*click*—and the air itself seems to ripple. Then, from the ruins behind you, another figure steps forward. And another. And another. They’re all like it: hollow-eyed, clicking, their bodies stitched together from scraps of cloth and metal. They’re *puppets*, you realize. Someone—or something—has been controlling them. And now they’re coming for you.

You don’t have time to think. You lunge forward, swinging the pipe. It connects with the first one’s ribs, and it *screeches*—a sound like tearing metal. The others recoil, their clicking stopping. You don’t wait. You run, dodging between the skeletal remains of a bus, your lungs burning. Behind you, the puppets stumble after you, their movements clumsy, but relentless.

You reach the riverbank and leap onto a half-submerged ferry, its hull rotting but still afloat. The water is cold, but you don’t stop to shiver. You kick free a rusted oar and start rowing toward the far shore, where the ruins thin into a stretch of overgrown fields. The puppets don’t follow. They can’t. They’re not built for water.

As you drag yourself onto land, panting, you see a figure waiting for you in the distance. A woman, her face half-hidden under a tattered hood. She holds out a hand, her palm open. In it is a single, unspoiled apple. *"You’re the first one who’s made it this far,"* she says, her voice rough but warm. *"We’ve been waiting for someone like you."*

You take the apple. It’s heavy, solid. Real.

And for the first time in a long time, you don’t feel alone.
