You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and...  

...the room itself seems to stretch and warp, like a ballroom folded into a Möbius strip. Chandeliers drip upside-down, and the guests wear masks made of melting clock faces. You pass a cluster of people waltzing in a tight circle, their footsteps creating ripples in the floor as if it’s water. They don’t see you, but their masks tilt toward you, whispering in a language that feels just shy of meaning—something about *lost keys* and *unwritten letters*.  

Ahead, a group lounges around a table piled high with hourglasses. They’re betting on how long each grain of sand will linger midair, frozen in suspension. “Time’s a performance,” one says, their voice echoing as they shrug off their suit jacket to reveal wings of origami cranes. You hesitate, but the table vanishes when you step closer, leaving a trail of cranes that flutter into a staircase spiraling upward.  

You climb, and the floors shift: one moment, you’re in a library where books scream when opened; the next, you’re in a garden where the flowers hum lullabies and their petals are made of tiny, flickering screens playing scenes from your childhood. In the distance, you spot a figure—your one known person—wearing a coat that shimmers like a mirage. But as you approach, they dissolve into a crowd of doppelgängers, each claiming to be them, each speaking in a voice you only half-recognize.  

One doppelgänger points to a door marked *“What You’ve Buried.”* Inside, you find a party happening in reverse: guests un-greeting each other, drinks unspilling, and your lost friend—*the real one*—unsmiling as they fade from the room. You reach out, but the scene rewinds faster, until you’re back at the start, outside the venue, holding an invitation that now reads *“Stay”* in blood-red ink.  

You wake up… but the clock on the wall ticks backward, and the doorhandle begins to turn.
