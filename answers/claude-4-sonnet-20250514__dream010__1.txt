...discover that each challenge represents a fear or doubt you've been carrying about your own abilities.

The first challenge takes place in a vast library with floating books. You must catch the right book that contains the knowledge you need, but every time you reach for one, it transforms into a butterfly and flutters away. You realize you've been afraid of not knowing enough, of being exposed as unprepared. Finally, you stop chasing and simply open your hands - a beautiful leather-bound book gently lands in your palms, whispering \.\ made of mirrors, each reflection showing a different version of yourself - some confident, others anxious, some wildly creative, others methodically precise. You need to find the exit, but every path leads to another reflection. The breakthrough comes when you stop trying to choose which version is \ walking straight through what you thought was a mirror but was actually an open doorway.

The final challenge surprises you: there is no competition. You're standing alone on a stage, and you realize all the other \ aspects of your own self-doubt. The job was never something to be won - it was something you were always capable of claiming.

You wake up with an strange sense of clarity, as if your sleeping mind just gave your waking self permission to pursue what you've been afraid to reach for.
