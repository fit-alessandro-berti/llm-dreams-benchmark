fetch water from the river.

As I cautiously step out of my makeshift shelter and onto the grassy terrain, my eyes adjust to the unfamiliar landscape. The sun hangs high in a azure sky, casting long shadows across the meadow-like expanse. The silence here is only broken by the gentle rustling of leaves in an absent breeze, devoid of any modern city noise.

I remember I need water—there's no option for hesitation. My feet guide me toward the river that flows nearby, its rippling surface reflecting the morning light and calling out to me like a beckoning friend. The path is clear, leading through tall blades of grass that sway side by side as if in time with my steps.

As I walk towards the riverbank, an aura of tranquility envelops me, a stark contrast to the bustling world most have grown accustomed to today. The air here smells fresh and pure; it carries the scent of earth mingled with the subtle fragrance released by the morning dew on grass blades.

The sight that awaits at the water's edge astonishes me—an oasis in what seems like an endless plain. Here, amidst nature's bounty, stands a wide river winding its way across the verdant terrain.

My heart beats with renewed purpose knowing not only had fetched me nourishment but also reignited within me an age-old connection to earth itself reminding us all that beneath civilizations facade hides primal need—simple yet timeless thirst for life nurtured since forever by our own two hands filled basket leading home towards uncharted dreams and awake existence.

With the water secured carefully on my back, I turn away from the river's embrace. The journey retraces its path to find where stone walls give way once more into familiar grounds—not quite as before but equally part of who we are—a blend of nature within us holding hope for whatever tomorrow may bring—this dream woven throughout consciousness now fading with each step towards waking life again becoming reality interwoven through layers deep inside our beings whispering secrets of the universe only dreams truly know...
