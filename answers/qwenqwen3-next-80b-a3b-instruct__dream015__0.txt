You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to plant a garden.

Not just any garden — a circle of life in a dead world.

You scavenge for seeds in the ruins of a forgotten library, brushing dust from yellowed packets marked “Heirloom Tomato,” “Sunflower,” “Basil.” In a rusted toolshed, you find a dented trowel and a cracked watering can, still holding a memory of rain. You clear the rubble from a cracked courtyard where the old city hall once stood, and beneath the ash-laced soil, you find something strange: the ground is still warm.

At night, you whisper to the soil. You tell it about the boy who used to chase fireflies in his yard, about the smell ofbread before the fire, about the last song your mother hummed.

Morning comes. You plant the first seed.

And then — miracle — it sprouts.

Not just one. Twenty. A hundred. Vines coil up crumbled concrete like tender fingers. Sunflowers burst through the ash, their golden heads turning slowly toward the pale sun, as if remembering the sky. The air smells of earth again — damp, alive, sweet.

But the real dream begins when you hear footsteps.

A child, dirty-faced and silent, stands at the edge of the garden. They don’t speak. Just stare at the green.

You offer them a tomato, still warm from the sun.

They take it.

And for the first time in years, they smile.

You realize then — you weren’t just planting seeds.

You were planting hope.

And hope, in this broken world, grows faster than any weed.

The garden expands.

Others come.

Not all are kind.

But some are.

And so, you plant — not just tomatoes, not just flowers — but names. Stories. Songs. Futures.

Because in the dream, the earth remembers.

And so do you.

And when you wake, your hand still smells like soil.
