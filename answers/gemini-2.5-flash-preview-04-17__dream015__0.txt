...you decide to **try and cultivate a small pocket of life.**

Not just for survival, though that's a constant hum beneath the surface of everything. No, you decide to plant a garden.

It feels utterly absurd. The ground is poisoned dust, the air often thick with fallout or strange, acrid fumes. Water is a rationed luxury, guarded fiercely. Seeds are mythical relics, found in forgotten caches or traded for desperate prices. And even if you manage all that, anything green is an instant target – for starving animals, opportunistic scavengers, or the inexplicable blights that sweep through the ruined landscapes.

But despite the hardships, despite the crushing weight of the dead world, you find a patch of relatively stable ground near the crumbling wall of what was once a library. You meticulously sift the soil, removing shards of glass, twisted metal, and bits of plastic debris. You use a dented canteen to dribble precious drops of water onto the barren earth. You carefully, almost reverently, bury the handful of salvaged seeds you've hoarded – maybe they were beans, maybe ancient flowers, you're not even sure.

And then you wait.

Days blend into a hazy cycle of scavenging, avoiding patrols, and returning to your small, ridiculous patch of dirt. You crouch beside it, a lonely figure against the backdrop of decay, whispering encouragement to the unyielding soil. You shield it from the harsh sun with a scrap of rusted metal, try to deter the scuttling things that emerge at dusk.

It's a fragile, desperate act of hope, a tiny rebellion against the desolation. You dream not of finding a safe haven or a hoard of supplies, but of seeing a single, defiant green shoot break through the grey crust. And in this dream, maybe, just maybe, after days of crushing disappointment, you see a flicker of colour, a tiny, hopeful sprout pushing its way into the harsh light, a stubborn, vibrant promise in a world that forgot how to grow. The dream focuses entirely on that one small, impossible green tip, and the overwhelming feeling of wonder and terror it inspires.
