*continue the dream...*

Despite the hardships, you decide to **climb the rusted water tower at the edge of the dead city**.

The metal groans beneath your boots, rungs loose and slick with morning dew that hasn't yet burned away under the pale, too-large sun. Your hands are stained with rust and old grease, and there's a gnawing emptiness in your stomach that's become as familiar as your own heartbeat. Three days since the last real meal—a can of peaches found in the ruins of a farmhouse, the label faded to illegibility.

But you climb anyway.

Because last night, through the broken binoculars you'd traded a pocket knife for, you saw something on the horizon. A light. Not the flickering orange of raiders' fires, not the cold blue of Old World tech gone wrong. Something steadier. Warmer. It had blinked three times, paused, then three times again.

*A signal.*

Someone is out there. Someone who knows the old codes.

The wind picks up as you reach the top, carrying the smell of dust and distant rain. The city below is a graveyard of twisted steel and shattered glass. You can see where the boundaries of the old neighborhoods used to be—now just arbitrary divisions between one type of ruin and another.

But to the east, past the skeletal remains of the highway, past the toxic glow of the crater lands, there it is. A tower of some kind, intact. And beside it, the unmistakable shimmer of water.

Your hand moves to the faded photograph in your pocket—the one you never show anyone. The one that keeps you moving when everything else tells you to lie down and let the dust take you.

You don't know if it's hope or foolishness that makes you start climbing back down toward the east road.

In this world, the two are hard to tell apart.
