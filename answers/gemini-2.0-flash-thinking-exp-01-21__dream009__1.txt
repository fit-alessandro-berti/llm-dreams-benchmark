You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find someone who understands this place and can help you figure out where – and *when* – you are.**

The air is thick with the smell of woodsmoke and something earthy, like damp soil and animals.  The sounds are unfamiliar – no hum of electricity, no distant traffic.  Instead, you hear the clanging of metal, the rhythmic thud of what sounds like a hammer, and the raucous cries of birds you don’t recognize.

You push yourself up from a surprisingly hard bed, covered in roughspun linen. The room is dimly lit by a single flickering candle, casting long, dancing shadows across walls made of roughly hewn timber.  Panic starts to prickle at the edges of your awareness.  This isn’t your room. This isn’t even your *time*.

Stepping outside, you are blinking in the sunlight. You are in a village, or perhaps a small town.  Buildings are made of wood and stone, with thatched roofs or roofs of heavy slate.  People are dressed in clothes of wool and leather, moving about their day with an unhurried pace.  You see carts pulled by oxen, people drawing water from a well, and the glint of metal from what looks like a blacksmith's forge.

Everywhere you look, there’s no sign of anything you recognize from your life. No cars, no electricity poles, no plastic, no glass windows as you know them. It's as if the world you knew simply vanished overnight.

A wave of disorientation washes over you.  You feel utterly lost, adrift in a sea of the unknown.  You try to speak, but your voice catches in your throat. You need help. You need information. You need to understand how you got here and, more importantly, how to survive in this strange, antiquated world.

And that's when it hits you.  You need to find someone. Someone who belongs here, someone who understands the customs, the language, the dangers, and the opportunities of this era. You need to find someone who can be your guide, your interpreter, your lifeline in this bewildering dreamscape.  You need to **find someone who understands this place and can help you figure out where – and *when* – you are.**

The search begins.
