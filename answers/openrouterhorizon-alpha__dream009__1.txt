…learn the language fast, or you’ll starve. The market square hums with bartered vowels and clipped consonants, a chisel-song of words carved by necessity. You pull in the sounds like breath. Bread becomes a gesture first—your palm flattened, your fingers slicing an invisible loaf—and then a syllable you can’t quite swallow. The baker stares, then laughs kindly, shoving a heel of crust into your hands. You taste it and repeat the word, crumb by crumb, until it sits right on your tongue.

Days pass measured by the sun’s crawl and the call of crows. You trade what you know—numbers, sketches, tricks with knots—for what they have: names for herbs, names for winds, names for the aches a body gets when it sleeps on straw. Your pockets learn their own vocabulary: a smooth river stone that means good luck, a copper coin that means you do not belong yet but might.

When you make mistakes—and you do—you bow. Bowing is a language with the fewest tenses; it speaks apology and thanks without asking the past to testify. The potter with clay-gray hands shows you how to center a spinning world with fingertips. “Hold,” she says, or something like it, guiding your wrist. You hold. The wobble settles.

You learn to listen to materials. Wood complains in whorls; clay sighs when it’s right; wool hums if you tease it just so. Your hands become a dictionary of textures. You teach them to tie a loop knot that cannot betray a bucket, to measure a span by your thumb to your little finger, to map a triangle on the ground with stakes and string.

You find work carrying water. Paths to the well thread through edges of conversation: gossip sparrow-light, worry heavy as a wet cloak. You carry it all, small and careful. One evening, as the sky goes old bruises, you realize you have a word for that particular shade because a child points and says a sound that tastes like plums. You repeat it, and the child nods. You keep it.

When they ask where you came from, you point over your shoulder at the mountain, at the sea, at the stars. You say a word you invented for elsewhere. They accept it, because elsewhere has always been a place you can’t walk to.

On the third week, a storm arrives with shoulders hunched, and the thatch begins to lift. You know a trick with ropes your grandfather taught you in a story, and your fingers translate it to this time like a prayer. You lash, weave, anchor, and the roof holds. The word for the knot is different here, but the knot itself is identical in the dark. They clap your back and pour you a drink that burns like a new alphabet.

You begin to dream in two languages. In one, there are engines and glass and the idea of immediacy. In the other, there is waiting and geese and the patience of bread rising. You wake suspended between them, a person stitched by time.

One morning at the river you meet a woman collecting reed, and she asks you to say your name again. You try both versions—the one your mother gave you, sharp and modern, and the one the village has wrapped around you, soft and shaped like a stone worn by water. She chooses the second and threads it into a song. The tune follows you all day, and later, when you pass the potter’s stall, you hear someone else humming it. This is how you learn belonging: by echo.

In winter, you help trap heat inside walls with mud and straw. You blink frost from your eyelashes and draw plans in the ash with a stick, gesturing to angles, to the way smoke wants to climb if you give it an escape that is both narrow and sure. They look at the drawing, then at you, as if you have translated the flight of birds. Someone makes a joke you understand only halfway, and the laughter is warm enough.

What you need to do, you realize, is not to remember the future but to make yourself legible to the present. So you inventory your skills and your silences. You keep your stories, but you change their verbs. Electricity becomes lightning’s cousin. Antibiotics become a rumor about mold. Satellites turn into steady stars that have learned to listen.

By spring, you can bargain for seed without pantomime. You know which stones along the road remember the rain longest, and how to place your steps accordingly. The baker stops taking your coins on certain days and just hands you a roll with extra poppy seeds, like a secret he is entrusting to you. The child with plum-colored words grows taller and faster and teaches you the name of a bird that only returns when the world is mending.

One night, the moon hangs low and fat over the fields, and you stand in its milk-light with your hands on your hips, as if you’ve built it. The air is threaded with smoke, with lullabies, with the sound of a jug being set down on a table beside a door that doesn’t lock because there is nowhere to go but here. You feel something loosen. You understand that surviving is an art in slow strokes, and that you have learned enough of its grammar to paint a life.

In the morning, you wake again—this time to a whistle from a kettle that doesn’t exist here, to the slick rectangle of a phone that is, impossibly, in your palm. The screen offers you a calendar, a headline, a choice. The village is still there, as vivid as steam. You could swipe. You could pocket it. You could let it sleep.

You could, you think, carry both eras inside you like twin jars of water, each reflecting a different sky. You turn the phone over. It shows you your face, which now has two names. You laugh, the sound translating itself, and put it in a drawer you build later that afternoon, with wood that complains in a language you have finally learned to answer.
