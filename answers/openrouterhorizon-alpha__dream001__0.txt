…walk, but the sidewalks keep sliding sideways like conveyor belts, carrying you past storefronts that change their names each time you blink. A bakery becomes a library becomes a dentist’s office with loaves of bread in the waiting room. You pat your pockets for a phone; your hand comes up holding a small brass compass that spins, stops, and points not north but toward a smear of light pooling at the end of the street.

You follow it. The buildings grow taller and thinner, leaning together like gossiping neighbors, their windows filled with people who are definitely you, at different ages, arguing silently behind the glass. You try to call out to them for directions, but your voice floats upward like a kite and gets snagged on a radio antenna. The hour shrinks to forty minutes without the minute hand moving; it’s the numbers themselves that slide closer together, like they’re impatient, like you are.

You turn a corner and step into a park where the paths are carpeted with printed maps. They rustle when you walk, whispering in languages you recognize but can’t read. Every map shows the city from a bird’s-eye view, except the bird is underwater, and the streets are currents you could swim. A woman on a bench holds a dog made entirely of keys. “You’re late,” she says kindly, even though you are early. “You’ll need the seventh door.”

“Where is it?” you ask, forgetting about the caught kite-voice and finding a smaller, truer one tucked behind your tongue.

She points with the dog’s paw, which jingles. Ahead, a row of doors stands freestanding in the grass: one red, one blue, one is a rectangle of rain, one a velvet curtain breathing in and out, one a mirror, one a chalk outline sketched on air. The seventh is plain wood, the kind you find at the back of a closet, the kind that remembers your hand. You put your palm on it and feel it check your pulse, then it opens inward to a stairwell that spirals both up and down at once.

You take a step sideways and it carries you queasily in both directions. A clock is waiting at the landing, a grandfather with a face like the moon. “No answers here, only arrivals,” it sighs, and the pendulum taps your wrist like a metronome. Thirty minutes.

At the bottom and top of the stairs you emerge into a train station that floats above the city on a web of cables. Trains arrive and depart without rails, humming like bees. The departure board lists platforms by feelings: Regret, Curiosity, Relief, Bravado. Your meeting is listed under Remembering, platform 3½. An arrow points nowhere in particular, then winks and points to a gap between two columns.

You slide through the gap and into a narrow passage that smells like chalk dust and summer rain. It opens into a small room with a round table. Four chairs: one empty, one occupied by your first bicycle, one by a plant you once forgot to water, now lush and forgiving, and one by a person whose face is your face if it had taken a different job ten years ago. They look up, smiling, as if you’re not late, as if you’re exactly when you meant to be.

“We’ve been waiting,” your other-self says, pushing forward a teacup that is already warm with the heat of your hand. “Agenda?” they ask, and the word curls in the air like steam.

You try to speak about the city, the sliding streets, the doors, the woman with the key-dog, but what comes out is simpler: “I don’t know where I’m going.”

“That’s why we’re meeting,” says the bicycle, its bell chiming once in agreement. The plant bends a little toward the light, which is coming from nowhere and everywhere. Your other-self opens a folder that is also a window. Outside it is the same city, except the buildings are arranged like the inside of a clock, and the streets align with your ribs.

“We need to decide,” they say gently. “Do we keep arriving, or do we choose a place to arrive to?”

The question sits between you all like a fifth chair. You realize the compass in your pocket has stopped spinning; it thumps twice, as if it has a heartbeat, then points—not to a place, but to your chest.

You laugh, the sound coming out whole this time, not drifting. “Seventh door,” you say, and they nod, as if that explains everything. The meeting proceeds: you sign your name in a book that knows how to spell all the versions of you. You drink the tea, which tastes like rain on pavement after a long heat. The bicycle skitters away to fetch a memory you misplaced and returns triumphant, balancing it on its handlebars like a cake.

When it’s done, the plant rustles approval. Your other-self stands, and for a moment you both mirror each other perfectly, a bridge swung across an unnamed river. “When you step back out,” they say, “the city will still be unfamiliar. But you’ll be the landmark.”

You thank them. You open the door that is really a thought. The station dissolves into a gentle drift of square shadows. You’re back on the street. The sidewalks still move, but your feet do too, in a rhythm that matches the clock’s old pendulum and your new, steady compass. Above you, in the windows, the other yous lean back and let you go.

You start to walk, and with each step the city stops trying to change faster than you can learn it. You pass the bakery-library-dentist and nod at the receptionist who is shelving baguettes by the Dewey Decimal System. You find the park and the doors, and as you pass the seventh it opens a little, just to say yes.

When you reach the corner, you realize you don’t need to know where the meeting is anymore. You already had it. You reach into your pocket out of habit, and your hand closes on a small brass compass that does not point but hums, small and content, keeping time with your heart as the unfamiliar city opens like a book you can finally read, not because the letters have changed, but because you have.
