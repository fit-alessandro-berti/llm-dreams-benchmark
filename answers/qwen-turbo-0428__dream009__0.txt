You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to find a way back home—before the world you know fades away entirely.

The air smells different, cleaner, and the sounds are unfamiliar: the clatter of horse-drawn carriages, the distant call of street vendors, the rhythmic clang of blacksmiths at work. You’re standing in what looks like a bustling medieval town square, with thatched-roof cottages, cobblestone streets, and people dressed in tunics, cloaks, and armor. A banner above the town hall reads *"The Kingdom of Lysoria, 1347."*

As you try to make sense of it all, a group of villagers approaches, their eyes wide with curiosity—and fear. One of them, a young woman with sharp features and a dagger at her side, steps forward. "Who are you?" she asks, her voice steady but wary.

You open your mouth to answer, but the words catch in your throat. How do you explain that you're from a future they can't imagine? Before you can respond, a horn blares in the distance. The crowd gasps. A knight on a white stallion rides into the square, his armor gleaming under the sun. "The Shadow King’s forces are approaching!" he shouts. "We must prepare!"

You realize, with a sinking feeling, that this isn’t just a dream—it’s a test. A trial. And if you fail, you may never return to your time.

So, as the villagers scramble to defend their home, you have a choice: help them fight against an ancient evil, uncover the secret of how you got here, or find a way to escape before the past consumes you.

What will you do?
