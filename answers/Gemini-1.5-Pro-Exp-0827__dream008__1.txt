...and you feel a cold sweat prickling your skin. The project brief, a dense stack of papers, trembled slightly in my hands. My boss, a looming figure with a perpetually furrowed brow, tapped his foot impatiently. My colleagues, faces a mixture of pity and morbid fascination, watched from their cubicles. 

Suddenly, the office lights flickered and dimmed. A low hum vibrated through the floor, growing louder with each passing second. The walls around me began to melt like wax, revealing a swirling vortex of vibrant colors. My boss, now with the head of a roaring lion, let out a deafening roar, "FINISH IT BY DAWN, OR FACE THE CONSEQUENCES!"

Panic seized me. I clutched the project brief tighter, the paper now feeling like sandpaper against my sweaty palms. But then, a strange calmness washed over me. From the vortex, a shimmering, ethereal hand emerged, holding a single, glowing pen.  

As if guided by an unseen force, I took the pen. It felt warm and strangely alive in my hand. The moment it touched the project brief, words began to flow effortlessly, forming coherent sentences, complex calculations, and stunning designs. The impossible deadline seemed to fade into the background as I worked, fueled by an unknown energy.

My lion-headed boss watched in stunned silence as page after page filled with brilliant solutions. The hum intensified, the vortex pulsed with light, and I, a mere human in the center of this cosmic chaos, became a conduit for something far greater than myself.  The dawn was fast approaching, but I knew, with absolute certainty, that I would finish. Not because of my own abilities, but because something, or someone, within the swirling chaos, was helping me succeed.
