As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and realize they aren't just decorative—they shift and flow under your gaze. A faint hum rises from the box, and the patterns begin to rearrange themselves, responding to your attention.  

Your fingertips brush a cool, smooth indentation, and suddenly you understand: the lock isn't opened with a key, but with a memory.  

You close your eyes and think of the first secret you ever kept. The box clicks softly.  

Then you remember a moment of pure joy—a laugh shared with someone you’ve since lost. Another click, this one deeper.  

Finally, you recall a truth you’ve never spoken aloud, even to yourself.  

The lid opens without a sound. Inside, there is only a small, worn mirror. You look into it and see not your own reflection, but the face of the person you were the last time you truly dreamed without fear.  

They smile at you—and you wake up.
