You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to adapt quickly to survive. The air is thick with unfamiliar scents, and the sounds of clattering hooves and distant chatter fill the air. Nearby, people in simple, homespun clothes go about their daily tasks.

You notice you’re in a bustling village market, with wooden stalls displaying fruits, woven baskets, and handmade tools. With no phone or map, you have to rely on your instincts and the kindness of strangers to understand where you are and how to navigate this place.

Hungry and thirsty, you decide your first priority is to find food and water. You approach a woman selling fresh bread and exchange a few coins you find in your pocket. She smiles kindly and offers you some cheese to go with it.

As you sit beneath a large oak tree, eating and observing the people around you, you realize you need to find shelter for the night. The sun is already beginning to set, casting long shadows over the village. You ask a blacksmith about lodging, and he points you toward an inn just beyond the marketplace.

Inside the inn, the warmth of the fire and the hum of quiet conversation soothe your nerves. As you settle in, you decide that tomorrow you will try to learn more about this era, its customs, and perhaps discover a way to return to your own time. But for now, you close your eyes, letting the strange new world lull you into a peaceful sleep.
