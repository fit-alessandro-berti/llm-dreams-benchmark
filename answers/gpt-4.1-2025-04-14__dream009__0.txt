find a way to blend in and survive. The air smells of woodsmoke and wildflowers. People wear rough linens and barter in the market square using handmade goods. You check your pockets: nothing but a smooth pebble and a scrap of cloth. Hunger gnaws at you.

First, you need to determine exactly what era you’re in. Listening closely at the bustling market, you hear snatches of conversation—an unfamiliar language, but recognizable words echo: “bread,” “market,” “herbs.” A cart rattles by, pulled by a shaggy horse. Children dart around your legs, laughing.

To survive, you decide to:

1. **Find Shelter**: You notice a friendly-looking baker, flour dusting her apron. You offer to help sweep her shop in exchange for a place in her loft that night.
2. **Learn the Basics**: Observing carefully, you mimic what others do—how they greet one another, the coins they use, what foods are safe to eat.
3. **Blend In**: You tear the hem off your modern shirt to make it less conspicuous. You trade your pebble, which has an unusual glimmer, for a rough woolen cloak.
4. **Seek Knowledge**: Approaching an old man selling books, you feign interest, hoping to both learn the language and the secrets of this era.

As night falls, you curl up in the warm bakery loft, the scent of fresh bread rising around you. As sleep overtakes you, you wonder:  
Will you try to find a way back home—or allow yourself to see what new adventures this unfamiliar era has in store?
