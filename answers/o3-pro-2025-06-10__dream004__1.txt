…and an obsidian-handled brush, bristles shimmering like starlight caught in rain.

The moment your fingers close around it, the brush hums—soft, like a half-remembered lullaby—and colors from the landscape leap toward the canvas of their own accord. Ruby spirals, sapphire mist, and molten gold drip through the empty air, waiting to be guided. Instinct takes over. 

One stroke: a crimson river appears, winding across the canvas. Yet instead of lying flat, the river ripples outward into the world itself. A second stroke: cerulean mountains rise, their peaks folding and unfolding like origami birds. A third: a pale-violet sun blooms, pulses, and gravity shifts—the sky plunges beneath your feet, the earth drifts above your head, and you are suspended between.

You notice the canvas is no longer hanging in front of you; it is becoming you, or perhaps you are becoming it. Your heartbeat sounds like a painter’s tap on a wooden easel. You lift the brush again, curious, fearless. This time you paint a doorway: four simple lines, silver and trembling. The door swings open, revealing a corridor of translucent glass with fish made of light gliding through its walls.

You step inside.

The corridor bends into a spiral staircase of feathers. Each feather bears a single glowing word—Fragments of forgotten dreams, maybe yours, maybe someone else’s: “lighthouse,” “clockwork orchard,” “paper moon.” As you ascend, the words lift off the feathers and orbit your head like fireflies, whispering stories in languages that feel like memories more than speech.

At the top you find a quiet room floating on nothing. Its floor is a pond so still it mirrors the universe. In the reflection you see yourself, brush still in hand, but behind your mirrored self stands a tall figure cloaked in shifting patterns: checkerboards sliding into nebulae into rolling ocean waves. The figure places their palm on the water’s surface—yet the real water, not the reflection—and ripples spread into both worlds at once.

“I am the canvas you left blank,” the figure says without moving their mouth. “And you are the color I was waiting for.”

They guide your hand, and together you paint a single seed onto the mirror-pond. It sinks, and from the depths rises a tree made of pure dawn. Branches of coral pink, leaves of liquid sunrise, roots of cool twilight. Fruit forms—round spheres that hold entire galaxies swirling within.

The figure gestures: choose.

You pluck one. It weighs nothing and everything at once. You take a bite, tasting nostalgia for moments that have never happened—walking along beaches of sound, laughing with strangers whose faces blur yet feel like family, reading books you haven’t written but somehow already miss. As the flavors dissolve, so does the room, the staircase, the corridor. You are falling upward through layers of unfurling paint, through alla prima skies and impasto seas.

Finally, you land before the original blank canvas. Except it’s not blank now; it contains the river, the mountains, the violet sun, the glass corridor, the feather staircase, the dawn-tree, even the bite-marked galaxy fruit—every element you created, nested within itself like a dream in a dream in a dream. In the lower corner, glowing softly, is a signature you never remember writing: your own.

The brush quiets. The colors settle. The dream inhales, then exhales, a hush of completion.

Somewhere far away an alarm clock begins to ring, but for one lucid instant longer you stand between waking and sleeping, smiling at the painted world that will keep shifting long after your eyes open—because now you know: whenever a canvas waits, you already carry the colors.
