the sky darkens, heavy clouds swirling overhead. The once-gentle breeze turns into a fierce wind, rustling the leaves and bending the trees. You feel an electric tension in the air as thunder rumbles in the distance, growing louder with each passing moment. Seeking shelter, you notice a faint glow emanating from deeper within the forest, beck personally you toward it.

As you hurry along the path, rain begins to fall in heavy drops, soaking your clothes. The glow intensifies, revealing a small, ancient stone structure covered in moss and vines, its entrance illuminated by a soft, golden light. You step inside, grateful for the refuge, and find yourself in a circular chamber with intricate carvings on the walls depicting scenes of storms and celestial events.

In the center of the room stands a pedestal with a glowing orb, pulsating with energy. As you approach, the orb hums softly, and a voice echoes in your mind, calm yet powerful: "You have been chosen to wield the storm's heart. Will you accept its power and restore balance?" Lightning flashes outside, illuminating the chamber, and you feel a surge of energy coursing through you.

You reach out toward the orb, and as your fingers brush its surface, the dream shifts. You find yourself standing atop a cliff, the storm now raging around you, but you are unafraid. The orb's power flows within you, allowing you to command the winds and direct the lightning. With a gesture, you calm the tempest, the clouds parting to reveal a starry sky. The forest below is serene once more, bathed in moonlight.

The voice speaks again: "You have brought harmony. Carry this strength into the waking world." As the dream fades, you feel a profound sense of purpose, the forest's tranquility lingering in your heart as you awaken.
