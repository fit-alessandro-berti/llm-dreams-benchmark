As I am Qwen, I can help you brainstorm ideas on how to overcome this difficult situation.

One possible course of action could be to seek advice from your mentor or supervisor about any technical hurdles or challenges that come up during the project. They could provide insights or solutions that align with your capabilities and strengths.

Alternatively, if the deadline is crucial to successfully completing your project, you might consider setting a more achievable time frame for your first draft or even a shorter sprint than your current schedule allows. This approach would help ensure that the project stays on track despite its initial constraints.

Additionally, discussing your project plan with team members can be beneficial. Sometimes, colleagues share similar views and experiences related to similar challenges. Collaborating with coworkers could provide innovative solutions or suggestions for better understanding team dynamics and priorities during this difficult time.

Lastly, don't forget to communicate openly with everyone involved in the process from start to finish. Transparency is key during project management, as it helps avoid delays and ensures that both you (the planner) and others feel their voices are heard, even if they haven’t been actively involved up to now.

These suggestions should help you navigate through this challenging situation with confidence and success. Remember, always stay calm and focused on achieving your goals!
