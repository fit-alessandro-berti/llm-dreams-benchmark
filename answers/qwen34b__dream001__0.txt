You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to *stumble through the labyrinthine streets*, the sky a swirling mosaic of hues that defy logic—deep indigo, shimmering gold, and stripes of electric blue that pulse like a heartbeat. The buildings are a blend of ancient architecture and impossible geometry: towers that twist like serpents, bridges that arch over rivers that flow backward, and shops with signs written in languages that whisper to your mind instead of your ears.  

A clock tower looms in the distance, its hands spinning in erratic patterns. You rush toward it, but the street beneath you shifts, rearranging itself like a puzzle. A stranger in a cloak of mirrored threads appears, their face a flickering reflection of your own. They point to a plaza ahead, where a colossal statue of a figure you recognize—*yourself*—stands beneath a sky full of constellations that spell out *“Dare.”*  

You follow the crowd to the plaza, where a door made of liquid light opens into a tunnel that smells like ozone and forgotten memories. Inside, the air thrums with a low, resonant hum. You sprint through the tunnel, your footsteps echoing in a way that feels both familiar and alien. At the end, a glowing path leads to a venue: a circular hall with walls that shift between glass and shadow, and a single seat at the center, empty.  

A voice echoes: *“You have all the time in the world.”* The meeting is a riddle, a test of your resolve. As the clock tower’s hands freeze, you realize the city never had a destination—it was a reflection of your mind, and the meeting was always within you. You step into the seat, and the room dissolves into the labyrinth again, but this time, the streets whisper your name.  

*Do you need to wake up?* the stranger asks.  
*No,* you think, *I’m not ready.*
