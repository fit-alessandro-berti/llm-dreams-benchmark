survive and adapt to this unfamiliar world. The air feels heavier, richer with the scent of earth and woodsmoke. You glance around, taking in the cobblestone streets lined with thatched-roof cottages, bustling markets filled with people dressed in tunics and cloaks, and the distant sound of blacksmiths hammering metal.

You quickly realize you need to **blend in**—your modern clothing marks you as an outsider. A woman nearby is bartering for bread at a stall, so you approach cautiously, hoping to observe how transactions work. Coins jingle in her pouch, but you have none. Instead, you notice small trinkets or goods being exchanged; perhaps trade will be your key to survival.

As hunger begins to gnaw at your stomach, you decide to find food. You spot a group of children playing near a stream, laughing as they toss stones into the water. One of them holds a basket brimming with wild berries. Remembering basic botany from school, you identify some familiar-looking fruits and offer to help gather more in exchange for a share. It’s a start.

But survival isn’t just about food—it’s also about shelter. Nightfall approaches fast, and without a roof over your head, you’ll be exposed to the elements. You recall seeing a tavern earlier, its warm glow inviting even from afar. Inside, patrons drink ale and tell stories by the fire. You consider offering your labor in exchange for a meal and a place to sleep. Sweeping floors or carrying supplies seems like a fair trade.

As days turn into weeks, you learn the customs of this era through observation and cautious interaction. People here value skills: weaving, carpentry, farming, and medicine. Realizing you lack these practical abilities, you focus on what you *do* know—basic first aid, navigation using stars, and storytelling. Tales of far-off lands captivate villagers gathered around evening fires, earning you scraps of food and gratitude.

However, danger lurks beyond the village. Bandits roam the countryside, preying on travelers. One night, while fetching water from the well, you overhear whispers of unrest in the kingdom. A rebellion brews against the ruling lord, who imposes harsh taxes on peasants. This complicates your situation—if sides must be chosen, where do you stand?

Your dream shifts again as you ponder whether this new life could become permanent. Do you attempt to uncover clues about returning to your own time, or embrace this simpler, yet perilous existence? As dawn breaks, painting the sky in hues of gold and pink, you feel both fear and excitement. Your journey has only begun.
