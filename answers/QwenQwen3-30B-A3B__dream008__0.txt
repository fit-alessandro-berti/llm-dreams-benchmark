You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you—  

**find yourself standing in a dimly lit office that isn’t yours.** The walls are made of shimmering glass, reflecting not your face but a chaotic montage of your worst fears: deadlines ticking backward, coworkers morphing into giant clocks, and your computer screen displaying a spreadsheet that rearranges itself into a maze. Your boss, a towering figure with a face made of static, hands you a folder labeled *“Project: Impossible.”*  

When you open it, the pages are blank… until you blink, and they erupt into a storm of text, graphs, and equations that shift like living things. Your coffee cup fills itself with ink, and the printer starts spitting out pages that dissolve into smoke as you try to read them. The clock on the wall ticks *backwards*, its hands spinning wildly.  

You ask, *“How am I supposed to finish this?”*  
Your boss’s voice echoes, *“You aren’t. But the universe needs your answer.”*  

Suddenly, the room folds inward, and you’re standing in a vast, empty plain. The project is now a giant, shifting puzzle in the sky, its pieces labeled *“Reality,” “Logic,” “Time,”* and *“Hope.”* You realize you can’t solve it with logic—so you *dance*. You twirl, stomp, and hum a tune from your childhood, and the puzzle pieces *melt* into a river of light.  

As you wade through it, the deadline dissolves into a flock of birds, and your boss materializes as a small, smiling child holding a crayon. They hand you a new folder: *“Project: You.”*  

You wake up at your desk, late for work, but the dream lingers—a strange warmth in your chest, a sense that the impossible isn’t a wall, but a door you forgot to knock on.  

*Or maybe… you’re still dreaming.*
