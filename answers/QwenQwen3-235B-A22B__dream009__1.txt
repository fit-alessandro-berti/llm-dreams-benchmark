**Dream Continuation:**  

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to *blend in before the townsfolk notice your anachronistic clothes—or worse, the glowing digital watch still ticking on your wrist*.  

The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth. A cobblestone path winds through a village of thatched-roof cottages, their windows flickering with candlelight. People in wool tunics and leather boots eye you warily, their voices hushed. You duck into a shadowed alley, heart racing, and glimpse a mural on a stone wall: a serpent coiled around a sundial, its scales etched with constellations. Beneath it, words in a language you almost understand—*"The Hourglass Key rewrites time, but only for those who dare bleed for it."*  

A hooded figure brushes past you, slipping a parchment into your hand. Unfolding it, you find a map dotted with cryptic symbols… and a crude drawing of your own face.  

*"Find the three Chronoweavers,"* a child’s voice whispers behind you. You turn to see a girl holding a dandelion clock, her eyes twin pools of starlight. *"Before midnight,"* she adds, blowing the seeds into the wind. *"Or this era becomes your grave."*  

The church bell tolls once. Eleven hours left.

What do you do next? Run toward the forest where the map points? Confront the girl? Or rip off your watch and hurl it into the river, hoping to sever whatever thread tethers you here? The dream hangs on your choice.
