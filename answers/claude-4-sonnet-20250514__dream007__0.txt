...walk away to cool down, but as I turn to leave, I realize we're standing in my childhood bedroom, except the walls are made of water that ripples with each word we spoke. My friend's voice becomes an echo that bounces off the liquid walls, multiplying until it sounds like a chorus of disappointment.

I reach for the door handle, but it transforms into a butterfly that flutters just out of reach. Each time I try to grasp it, more butterflies appear, filling the room with their silent wings. My friend is still talking, but now their words are visible—floating in the air like soap bubbles that pop when they touch the ceiling.

I want to apologize, to explain, but when I open my mouth, only music comes out—a melody I've never heard before but somehow know by heart. The butterflies begin to dance to the rhythm, and slowly, impossibly, my friend starts to smile. The water walls become transparent, revealing that we're actually inside a snow globe, and someone enormous is gently shaking our world.

The argument feels both urgent and completely forgotten, the way only dreams can hold two contradictory truths at once.
