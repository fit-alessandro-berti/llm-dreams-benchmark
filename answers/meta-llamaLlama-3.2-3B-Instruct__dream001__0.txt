...feel a growing sense of panic as I scan my surroundings, trying to get my bearings. The city stretches out before me like a labyrinth, with towering skyscrapers and neon-lit streets that seem to go on forever. I squint, trying to make out any familiar landmarks or signs, but everything looks alien and unfamiliar.

I pull out my phone to check my schedule, but my vision is blurry and the screen is blank. I must have dropped it in my haste to get here. I rummage through my pockets, feeling for the device, but it's not there. No matter. I'm sure I can figure out where I need to be.

I start to walk, trying to get a sense of the city's layout. The streets are narrow and winding, with alleys and side streets that seem to disappear into thin air. I hail a taxi, hoping to get a sense of the city's orientation, but the driver seems to know exactly where he's going, and he speeds away, leaving me feeling even more disoriented.

As the minutes tick by, my anxiety grows. I'm starting to feel like I'm trapped in some kind of never-ending maze, with no escape in sight. I quicken my pace, my feet pounding the pavement in a desperate bid to find my meeting on time.

Suddenly, I catch a glimpse of a landmark - a grand, Gothic-style church with towering spires that seem to pierce the sky. I remember seeing a picture of it in a magazine once, and it must be nearby. I set a course for the church, hoping to find some clue about my meeting.

As I run, the city around me begins to change. The skyscrapers give way to old stone buildings, and the streets become narrow and cobblestone. I feel like I'm entering a different world, one that's been hidden beneath the surface of the modern city.

The church comes into view, and I see a small inscription on the door: "La Casa della Luna" - the House of the Moon. I push open the door, and a bell above it rings out, echoing through the streets. I step inside, and find myself in a cozy, dimly-lit courtyard, surrounded by ancient stone pillars. A small, ornate door in the center of the courtyard is open, and I can see a glimmer of light coming from within.

I take a deep breath, and push open the door. As I step through it, I realize that I'm not alone. A figure stands in the shadows, watching me. And I sense that my meeting is just a short distance away...
