run down the winding streets, heart pounding, head swirling with the hum of distant conversations and the scent of something unfamiliar—perhaps spices, or rain, or something else entirely. The city is alive with movement: vendors hawk wares in languages you don’t quite recognize, their stalls glowing with lanterns that cast shifting shadows. You try to remember the address, but it’s just beyond your grasp, like a half-remembered melody.

Then, a flicker of recognition—perhaps a building you’ve seen before, or a street name that rings familiar. You dart forward, weaving through the crowd, only to realize the path splits in two. One way leads uphill, the other down into a narrower alleyway. A child with knowing eyes grins and points downward. "The *old* way," she says, before vanishing into the throng.

The alley is dim, the air thick with the scent of damp stone. A single streetlamp flickers overhead, and as you step forward, the cobblestones shift beneath your feet—no, they’re moving. The ground is alive, rolling like waves toward the heart of the city, pulling you along. The buildings twist and stretch, forming a tunnel of light and color. You’re *dreaming*—but the realization doesn’t stop the dream.

A voice calls your name from ahead. You round a corner and there, floating just out of reach, is a door. It’s painted in swirling patterns, and as you reach for the handle, it swings open on its own. Inside, the meeting has already begun. The people at the table turn—some smile, some seem puzzled. The most striking of them, a woman with silver braids and sharp eyes, leans forward and says, *"You’re late. But I suppose that’s why you’re here."*

The dream tilts then, and you’re no longer in a city—you’re falling, or flying, or both, through a sky filled with constellations that rearrange themselves just beyond comprehension. The woman’s voice lingers: *"Is this what you wanted?"*

And then—
