You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and...

...the first group you approach are engaged in a heated debate about the correct way to fold an invisible map. Their voices are strangely muffled, as if filtered through water, and their faces flicker with an unreadable expression. One person gestures vaguely in a direction you think your friend might have gone, but their arm stretches impossibly, pointing through a wall that wasn't there a moment ago.

You try to move past them, the crowd becoming thicker, a warm, oppressive weight against you. The air smells faintly of forgotten memories and burnt sugar. You catch a glimpse of what looks like your friend's distinctive red scarf disappearing into a darker alcove. Hastening, you push through a cluster of people wearing identical, oversized papier-mâché masks shaped like smiling suns. They don't speak, but their silent laughter seems to fill the space, a reverberating, unnerving hum.

The alcove opens into a vast, echoing hall where the ceiling is too low and the floor is strangely uneven, almost like walking on a distorted wave. Here, a group of figures, half-shadow, half-light, are playing a game of chess with pieces that transform every time they are moved – a knight becomes a teacup, a pawn a flickering flame. Their movements are fluid, unnatural, their faces obscured by the shifting light. You try to ask if they've seen your friend, but your voice comes out as a chirp, unheard above the clatter of the transforming pieces. One of the figures looks up, and for a terrifying second, their face is your friend's, but contorted, stretched, and then it's gone, replaced by swirling shadow.

You stumble back, the hall dissolving behind you, replaced by a lush, overgrown garden party. Vines snake around ornate lampposts, and the air is heavy with the scent of night-blooming jasmine. People here are speaking in a language made entirely of chirps and whistles, their bodies swaying in unison to a music that sounds like wind chimes played by the tide. You see a flash of your friend's smile across the garden, their hand lifted in what seems like a greeting, but when you try to call out, your throat is dry, and the smile seems to ripple, becoming the reflection in a dewdrop, then the curve of a distant crescent moon.

The garden morphs into a dimly lit gallery, walls hung with portraits where the eyes follow you, not just from the paintings, but from the faces of the silent, observing crowd. Their gazes are heavy, judging, and the silence is so profound it hums in your ears. You feel an urgent need to escape, to find the one familiar face in this shifting, uncanny landscape. The floor beneath your feet softens, becoming spongy, then wet. You realize you are wading through shallow water, its surface reflecting the distorted faces of the portraits, now melting like wax.

Panic begins to bubble. You see your friend, finally, standing at the very edge of the water, looking directly at you. Their expression is gentle, but also tinged with an unbearable sadness. You start to move towards them, the water rising around your ankles, then your knees. They reach out a hand, but as you near, their features begin to blur, their form to waver, like smoke in a breeze. The entire gathering – the muffled debates, the silent laughter, the transforming chess, the whistling language, the judging eyes – all merge into a single, overwhelming cacophony of distorted sound and shifting light. The water is up to your chest now, and your friend is dissolving, becoming just a faint outline against the shimmering chaos. You reach out, desperate to grasp them, to solidify them, but your hand passes through nothing but cool, liquid air. The world spins, colours bleed, and the desperate longing for the familiar face becomes an unbearable weight.

Then, with a gasp, your eyes snap open. The ceiling is familiar, the sounds are the gentle hum of your refrigerator and the distant traffic. The oppressive crowd, the melting faces, the impossible spaces – all gone. You take a shuddering breath, the residual chill of the dream water still clinging to your skin, and the faint, lingering scent of jasmine and burnt sugar. It takes a moment for the real world to fully reassert itself, leaving only the fading echo of a desperate search for the one you knew in a world that refused to stay still.
