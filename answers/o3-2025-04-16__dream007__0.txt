…and you decide to step outside to cool off for a moment.  

The front door swings open and, instead of the familiar street, you find a vast railway platform bathed in twilight. Trains the color of thunderclouds wait silently, their windows glowing with an amber light. Your friend follows close behind, mid‑sentence, but the words dissolve into steam that curls upward and becomes a flock of birds.

A conductor with the face of an old pocket watch taps his silver cane: “One ticket for Reconciliation, one for Resentment. Which line will you take?”  
You reach into your pocket and pull out two paper cranes, each bearing one of the words. Your friend holds out an open palm; you place both cranes there, refusing to choose alone.

The platform tilts like a giant seesaw. Luggage spills open, and memories—birthday candles, late‑night phone calls, inside jokes—flutter around you like photographs caught in a breeze. One lands at your feet: a snapshot of the moment you first realized this friendship mattered. You pick it up, and it turns warm, then liquid, then a glowing key.

You and your friend spot a door standing by itself on the platform, no walls attached. The key slides in effortlessly. On the other side there is a small kitchen from childhood, smelling of cinnamon and rain. You sit at opposite ends of a wooden table that stretches and shrinks with your breathing. The argument resurfaces, but the words emerge as colored marbles that roll across the table. You each collect the ones that match your feelings—reds for anger, blues for fear, greens for hope.

When the last marble stops moving, you notice the colors have arranged themselves into a single spiral pattern. The conductor’s voice echoes from nowhere: “Spiral forward, or circle back?”

You look at your friend. Without speaking, you both push the spiral toward the center of the table. It melts into a small tree that grows instantly, branches weaving overhead until they form a canopy of glass leaves. Each leaf holds a reflection: one of you angry, one of you laughing, one silent, one forgiving. A gentle breeze rattles the leaves, and all the reflections fuse into a single image—both of you standing side by side.

The tree drops a final leaf into your hands: it’s blank. Together, you write a single word on it—“Listening.” The tree absorbs the leaf, glows softly, and the kitchen dissolves into morning light.

You wake up with the faint taste of cinnamon on your tongue and the sound of departing trains fading in your ears, remembering only that in the dream you and your friend chose the same ticket.
