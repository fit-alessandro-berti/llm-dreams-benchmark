You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the sky darkens with swirling clouds. The wind picks up, rustling the leaves and sending whispers through the trees. Just as the first drops of rain begin to fall, a brilliant flash of lightning illuminates a hidden path you've never noticed before. Drawn by curiosity, you follow the path deeper into the forest, where the rain softens and strange, glowing flowers bloom along the way. The storm rumbles above, but here, in this secret place, there is a serene calm, as if you’ve stepped into a world untouched by the storm. Ahead, a gentle light beckons—you feel a sense of wonder and anticipation about what you might discover next.
