...and, as your fingers trace the swirling grooves, the patterns begin to shift—subtly at first, like ripples across still water. The wood (or is it wood? It feels cool as stone, yet light as balsa) seems to breathe beneath your touch. A low hum vibrates through your bones, not heard but *felt*, resonating from the core of the box.

Then, the patterns rearrange themselves into constellations you’ve never seen—stars forming impossible geometries that twist your sense of direction. One symbol pulses faintly, a deep indigo that seems to drink the light around it. Instinctively, you press your thumb against it.

The box doesn’t click open. Instead, it *unfolds*.

Not like hinges or latches—but like origami blooming in reverse. Panels peel away from each other, folding outward into fractal petals of shimmering silver and obsidian. Inside isn’t a cavity, but a miniature cosmos: a swirling nebula contained within glass-smooth void, tiny stars winking like distant fireflies. At its center floats a single, perfect key—but it’s made of frozen moonlight, humming the same frequency as the box.

You reach for it, but the dream-logic shifts. Your hand passes through the nebula, and suddenly *you’re* inside the box, adrift in that tiny galaxy. The key drifts toward you, and as it nears, you realize it’s not a key at all—it’s a memory. *Your* memory. The first time you felt truly lost… and truly found.

The box snaps shut behind you.

You wake with the taste of stardust on your tongue, and the faint, fading echo of a lullaby you’ve never heard—but somehow know by heart. On your nightstand, a single silver petal rests, already dissolving into morning light.
