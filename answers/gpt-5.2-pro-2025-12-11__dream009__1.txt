…realize you need to survive long enough to figure out why you’re here—and whether you can ever get back.

The air tastes of woodsmoke and damp earth. Your first instinct is to reach for your phone. Your hand closes on nothing but blanket: coarse wool, scratchy against your palm. You sit up too fast and the room tips, the ceiling beams swimming above you like the ribs of a ship.

The place is a single room—low, dim, and alive with small noises: the tick of cooling embers, a mouse skittering inside a wall, a distant rooster that sounds like it’s calling across centuries. The window is tiny and uneven, its glass full of ripples that catch the daylight in watery patches.

You swing your feet to the floor. Bare boards. Cold enough to sting.

Outside, the world is wrong in the way a stage set is wrong: beautiful, convincing, and missing everything you expect to see. No power lines. No road markings. No distant whine of traffic. The air is too quiet—quiet the way it gets after a snowstorm, except the ground is green and wet and dotted with mud.

A woman in a dark dress and apron stands near a well, hauling a bucket up hand-over-hand. Her hair is pinned under a cloth. She looks up at you, not startled, as if she’s been expecting you to wake.

“You’re late,” she says, and wipes her hands on her apron. “Come. If you’re going to be foolish, be useful while you are.”

You open your mouth, and what comes out isn’t the question you meant to ask.

“What day is it?”

She squints at you, as if you’ve asked what color water is. “Tuesday. Don’t stand there with your mouth open. The baker will not give us credit again.”

Your heart does a slow, heavy turn in your chest. Tuesday is not an answer. Tuesday is a trapdoor.

You follow her because you don’t know what else to do.

The village is a cluster of timbered houses and narrow lanes. People move with purpose. A child runs by with a stick and a hoop. A man pushes a cart that squeals in protest. Everything smells—animal, smoke, damp wool, bread—real smells, close and layered.

As you walk, you try to solve it like a problem: shock, dream logic, head injury. But the stones under your feet bite back with every step. The cold sits in your lungs. A drop of rain lands on your eyelashes and you blink it away.

At the edge of the square, a notice board stands under a little roof. Papers nailed to it curl at the corners. Your eyes snag on the print—blocky, old-fashioned—and then on the date inked at the bottom.

You read it twice.

Then a third time, slower, as if your carefulness can change the ink.

Your stomach empties itself of certainty. This is not your year. Not your decade. Not even your century.

You swallow. “What—what town is this?”

The woman glances at you sideways. “Are you fevered? It’s Harrowfen.”

Harrowfen means nothing to you, but the name doesn’t feel made up. It feels like a word worn smooth by generations of mouths.

You stand there, under the soft gray light, and a thought arrives fully formed: you need shelter, food, and a story. In this place, being without a story is the same as being without a face.

You take a breath and build one.

“I… don’t remember,” you say, and let your voice crack just enough to be believable. “I woke up and—I don’t remember how I got here.”

The woman’s expression shifts—not to sympathy, exactly, but to the grim practicality of someone who has seen illness, misfortune, and worse. She nods once.

“Then you’ll work,” she says. “Work helps a wandering mind. And if you’re lying, work will punish you for it.”

She leads you to the baker. The heat hits you like a living thing. Flour dust hangs in the air like pale fog. A man with arms like tree trunks shapes dough with a tenderness that surprises you. He looks you over, sees your clothes—wrong fabric, wrong cut, clean in a way that makes you suspicious—and his gaze sharpens.

“Who’s this?”

“A stray,” the woman says. “Arlen found them by the mill path.”

The baker snorts. “Strays come with fleas.”

“I don’t have fleas,” you blurt, then realize how strange it sounds.

The baker’s mouth twitches, almost a smile. He tosses you a cloth. “Wipe the table. If you touch the oven without being told, you’ll lose fingers.”

You work. You do what you’re told. You make yourself small and useful. You learn quickly: the rules of heat, the rhythm of tasks, the unspoken boundaries of people who have known each other their whole lives.

Hours pass. Your hands redden. Your mind keeps reaching for the absent map of modern life—GPS, internet, a news site, any anchor—and finds only air.

By afternoon, you’ve earned a heel of bread and a cup of thin ale. You sit outside behind the bakery, on an upturned crate, and stare at your own hands as if they belong to a stranger.

That’s when you notice the mark.

On the inside of your wrist, where your watch should be, there is a faint bruise-shaped symbol, like an old stamp: a circle crossed through with a vertical line, and beside it three tiny notches.

You rub at it. It doesn’t fade.

A shadow falls across you.

An old man stands there, leaning on a cane that looks too polished for a villager’s tool. His clothes are plain but well kept. His eyes are pale and sharp as winter.

He looks at your wrist without asking.

“You woke with it,” he says.

You don’t know whether to deny it. Something in his voice is too calm, as if he’s confirming weather.

“Yes.”

He nods, like that settles something. “Then you’re not the first.”

Your pulse stutters. “You’ve seen this before?”

“Once,” he says. “Many years ago. A girl. She asked about a thing called a train.” His gaze fixes on your face, searching for recognition the way someone searches for a family resemblance. “She did not last the winter.”

The crate feels suddenly unsteady beneath you. “What is it? The mark.”

“A door,” he says, and taps his cane once on the ground. “Or the scar of one.”

You stand. The air feels thinner. “I need to go back.”

The old man’s expression hardens—not cruelly, but like stone set into a wall. “Wanting is not the same as getting. If you want to live long enough to attempt it, you must stop asking loud questions.”

He turns as if to leave, then pauses.

“Come tonight,” he says, as if offering an errand. “When the bell rings for the ninth hour. To the ruined chapel in the alder grove. Do not bring the woman. Do not tell the baker. Do not let anyone see you go.”

You take a step forward. “Why should I trust you?”

He looks back over his shoulder. “Because I am the only person in Harrowfen who knows what you are.”

Then he walks away, his cane making a soft, steady beat in the mud.

All day you work with the knowledge burning behind your eyes. The woman—Mara, you learn her name by overhearing it—watches you like you might fall apart in her hands. You keep your face steady. You laugh at the right moments. You lift sacks. You wipe flour. You nod when spoken to.

When evening finally arrives, the village folds into itself. Smoke curls from chimneys. The lanes empty. Doors close with the finality of locks you can’t pick.

You wait until the bell tolls—slow, solemn, nine heavy notes—then slip out the back, your heart hammering so loud you’re sure the dogs will hear it.

The alder grove is a darker kind of dark. Wet leaves shine like fish scales. The ruined chapel rises between the trees, its roof half-collapsed, its stones furred with moss. A broken bell hangs inside, silent.

The old man stands in the doorway, as if he has been there for hours.

“You came,” he says.

“I’m not staying here,” you reply. The words are too fierce, too thin.

“No,” he agrees. “You are not meant to.”

Inside, the chapel smells of rot and old prayers. The moonlight slants through the broken roof, laying pale rectangles across the floor. In the center of the chapel, the stones form a circle—different from the rest, smoother, etched faintly with lines that catch the light when you move.

Your breath catches. The lines on the stones match the mark on your wrist.

“You did not carve that,” you whisper.

“No,” the old man says. “It was here before my grandfather’s grandfather had a name.”

He kneels beside one of the stones and brushes away leaves, revealing a carved notch—one of three.

“Three turns,” he says. “Three chances. That is what the stories say. The girl—the one who spoke of trains—she had two notches left when she arrived. She wasted one on fear.”

You swallow. “And the last one?”

The old man’s eyes are fixed on the circle. “She tried to open it on a night like this. The door opened. Something else stepped through first.”

The grove seems to lean inward. The trees hold their breath.

“What stepped through?” you ask, though you can feel your body begging you not to.

The old man’s voice drops. “A hunger. A shape that wanted the warmth of a life. It wore her voice for a week before the villagers understood there were two of her.”

Your hands have gone cold. “So why bring me here?”

“Because you will try anyway,” he says, and looks up at you. “And because if you try alone, you will die.”

He reaches into his coat and pulls out a small object wrapped in cloth. He unfolds it carefully.

A watch.

Not a pocket watch. Not a sundial. A wristwatch—scratched and dead, but unmistakably modern. The face is cracked like ice, the hands frozen at 3:17.

Your throat tightens. It’s an impossibility in his palm.

“I kept it,” he says. “As proof I wasn’t mad. As proof she was real.”

You stare at it, and something in you shifts—the way it does when you find a familiar object in a stranger’s house and realize, abruptly, that your life has been handled by other hands.

“She had this,” you manage.

He nods. “And now I give it to you. Not because it will work. Because it will remind you what you are fighting for when the circle tries to convince you you were always meant to be here.”

He sets the watch in your hand. It’s heavier than you expect.

The air over the circle shivers, almost imperceptibly, as if the moonlight is a curtain and something behind it has moved.

The old man stands. “Listen,” he says. “The door is not kind. It does not care where you go—only that something passes. If you open it, do not hesitate. Do not look back. And if you hear your name spoken in a voice you love—”

“I won’t,” you say quickly, because you can already imagine it: your mother calling you from another room, your friend laughing, your own ringtone in the distance like a cruel joke.

“—then you must treat it as a trap,” he finishes. “You must keep moving.”

He steps to the edge of the circle and gestures you forward.

Your feet carry you as if they belong to someone braver.

When you stand on the carved stones, the mark on your wrist warms. Not pain. Not comfort. A sensation like waking up from anesthesia: the slow return of feeling.

The notches on the circle gleam faintly. Two of them are shallow. One is deeper, filled with darkness.

“One chance is already spent,” you whisper, staring at it.

The old man’s face is unreadable. “Not yours,” he says. “The door keeps count, not the traveler.”

You look down at the watch in your hand. 3:17. Frozen. Useless.

Then, without warning, the second hand ticks.

Once.

It shouldn’t. It can’t.

Your breath catches. The hairs on your arms lift. The air in the chapel tightens, pressurized, like the moment before lightning strikes.

The old man’s eyes widen. For the first time, he looks afraid.

“It’s opening,” he says.

The moonlight above the circle bends, as if someone has pressed a thumb into the sky. A thin, dark line appears—straight as a cut—and the space around it begins to ripple. Sound drains away. Even the leaves outside go silent.

In the line’s darkness, something moves.

Not a figure. Not yet. More like a thought trying to become a body.

Your name is spoken.

Softly.

In a voice you haven’t heard in months.

Your chest constricts. For an instant, you can smell your old apartment—the detergent you used, the stale coffee in your sink, the warm electronics hum of a life you took for granted.

You take a half-step toward the sound.

The old man’s cane slams into the stone.

“Do not,” he snarls, the word sharp enough to cut. “That is not them.”

The voice says your name again, pleading now. It sounds wounded. It sounds right.

You close your eyes hard enough to see sparks. You clutch the watch until its broken face bites your skin.

You force your feet to move—forward, not toward the voice, not toward the dark shape gathering itself in the crack.

The line widens.

For a heartbeat, you see through it—not the village, not the chapel, but a blur of lights and motion: a street at night, neon, rain on asphalt, the roar of distant traffic. The modern world. Your world. Close enough to smell.

Your whole body surges toward it.

Behind you, the voice sharpens into something else—something angry at being refused. The darkness in the crack bulges, as if trying to push through around you.

The old man shouts something you don’t understand—an old word, a command, a prayer. The circle flares, the carved lines burning silver. The watch in your hand ticks faster, frantic.

You run.

You don’t look back.

You throw yourself into the slit of night between worlds—

—and wake up in your bed, gasping, your room dark except for the glow of your phone on the nightstand.

For a moment, relief hits so hard you almost laugh. Your familiar ceiling. Your familiar air. The soft, constant hush of your city beyond the window.

Then you notice your wrist.

On the inside, where your watch usually sits, there is a faint circle-and-line bruise, and beside it—

two tiny notches.

Your phone buzzes. A notification you don’t recognize.

No sender name. No number.

Just a message.

**DON’T WASTE THE LAST ONE.**
