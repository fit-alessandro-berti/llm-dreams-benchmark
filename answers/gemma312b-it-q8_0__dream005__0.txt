...(I yawn languidly within the dream. Everything has this subtly skewed perspective, colors too vibrant, light filtering unnaturally.)

"...various groups of people. The first is a cluster by the enormous punch bowl – it looks less like punch, more like molten raspberry glass - all debating earnestly the optimal height for a badger chimney stack. I overhear phrases like "draft regulation" and "...aesthetic conformity is key, clearly!". They're all impeccably suited penguins with varying bow tie shapes. I cautiously sidestep them, feeling acutely self-aware in my slightly crumpled velvet frock, attempting to appear nonchalant by dramatically admiring a ridiculously large artificial fern. It sheds constantly. I get little flecks of plastic foliage sticking to my face. 

Then, just beyond the penguin architects, a chaotic circle of squirrels are gathered, competing fiercely in some sort of nut-burrowing competition. Each squirrel is holding a tiny judge’s placard. They leap, dash, and argue intensely - mostly in chittering noises, but punctuated by the occasional shouted, accusatory: "Improper dig-angle!” 

Trying to orient myself, I head towards what *seems* to be the main hall, a shimmering distance past a table inexplicably piled high with shimmering, iridescent marshmallows. But as I near it, it resolves into a giant chessboard where humans are representing the pawns. Not *playing*, acting… each delivering a prepared monologue entirely composed of rhyming couplets with little thematic relevance to anything. "Oh, the wilting fern does sigh, as sorrow fills the summer sky!". I awkwardly knock against a large, lumbering King, who turns a bewildered ceramic face. 

Feeling slightly dizzy, I continue – drawn by…what sound resembles laughter? It's coming from a conservatory bathed in orange light where three enormous, fluffy cats with miniature top hats are meticulously crafting tiny porcelain cities with tweezers and a disturbingly delicate touch, critiquing each other: “Darling, a single gable’s askew! Utterly ruins the harmony of the civic sprawl!". One cat gives me a pointed look. I reflexively smooth my crumbling velvet. 

The laughter intensifies. Now leading me towards a smaller, less ostentatious garden filled entirely with sunflowers that are surprisingly opinionated.

"Honestly Bertram," squints one colossal bloom pointing a pollen-dusted face at another. "Your rotation is *dreadful*. Absolutely dreadful for maximizing the light absorption!”

Suddenly, a voice breaks through the buzzing, chittering, and pollen-fueled pronouncements.

“You look desperately lost."

I turn, almost jumping. Standing near a particularly large, slightly wonky sunflower is Elias... the only person I knew I needed to locate. He's wearing a monocle and tending a row of meticulously labelled glow worms in miniature terrariums, completely unfazed by the madness all around us. 

“Indeed,” he continues, observing my face with a quiet stillness.  “This annual Garden Gnome Appreciation Society Soiree often throws first-timers for a loop.  I'm tending my bioluminescence exhibit of course. Very exclusive.”

He gestures around with a small, gardening trowel. "But I’ve been meaning to ask…do you enjoy the taste of dewdrop marmelode?" 

The sunflower pointedly swivels, focusing its attention intensely in our direction, then emits a sigh: "About time you two joined us." ...And I suddenly realized, the absurdity of everything wasn't so bothersome *because* it was bizarre…it was simply…normal. And Elias, with his meticulous glowworms, was entirely in his element. 

...Then, a tiny, exquisitely detailed miniature dragon landed on my nose."
