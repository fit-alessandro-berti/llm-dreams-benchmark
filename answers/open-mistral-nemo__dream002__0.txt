As the first rumble of thunder echoes through the trees, you quicken your pace, seeking shelter. The once vibrant leaves above begin to rustle and sway, their colors blurring into a whirl of autumn hues. The air grows colder, and a sharp wind picks up, carrying with it the scent of rain.

You spot a small, quaint cottage nestled between two large oak trees, its warm, inviting light spilling out from the windows. As you approach, the first heavy drops of rain begin to fall, pattering against the leaves and the wooden roof of the cottage. You knock on the door, and it creaks open to reveal an elderly woman, her eyes kind and welcoming.

"Come in, child," she says, ushering you inside. "You're just in time for tea."

The cottage is cozy, filled with the aroma of freshly baked bread and the soft hum of a crackling fire. You sit down at the wooden table, and the woman pours you a cup of steaming tea. As you take a sip, you notice that the storm outside has begun to intensify, the rain now pounding against the windows, casting eerie shadows on the walls.

Suddenly, a loud crash of thunder startles you, and the lights flicker and go out. The woman lights a candle, her face illuminated by its soft glow. "Don't worry, dear," she says, "this old cottage has weathered many a storm. You're safe here."

You take a deep breath, feeling a sense of calm wash over you. The storm rages on outside, but inside the cottage, it's warm and peaceful. You lean back in your chair, listening to the comforting sound of the rain, and allow yourself to drift off into a peaceful sleep.
