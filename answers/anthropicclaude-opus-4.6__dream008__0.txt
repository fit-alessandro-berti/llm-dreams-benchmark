feel the weight of their expectation like something physical pressing against your chest.

You open the project folder, but the pages are blank. No—not blank. The words are there, but they keep sliding off the edges of the paper like water. You try to read them faster, but the faster you look, the faster they flee.

Your boss is still standing behind you. You can feel them there without turning around. Their shadow is too long. It stretches across your desk, across the floor, up the opposite wall, and onto the ceiling. You realize you haven't heard them breathe.

You try to type, but your keyboard has too many keys now. Letters you don't recognize. Symbols from languages that haven't been invented yet. Every time you press one, the office lights flicker and a phone rings somewhere deeper in the building—a part of the building you've never seen.

"The deadline," your boss says, except their voice comes from the computer speakers. You turn around and they're gone. But the chair across from you is still spinning slowly, as if someone just stood up.

The clock on the wall has three hands. All of them are moving backward at different speeds.

You stand up to get coffee—coffee will help, coffee *always* helps—but the break room hallway keeps stretching. The door at the end stays the same distance away no matter how many steps you take. You can smell the coffee, though. It smells like rain.

Your phone buzzes. A text from yourself: **"Don't finish it."**

You sit back down. The project folder is full now, every page covered in your handwriting—work you don't remember doing. It's perfect. It's the best work you've ever produced. But the last page just says, over and over:

*wake up wake up wake up wake up*

The clock strikes a number that doesn't exist.

And your boss is behind you again.

"How's it coming?" they ask.

You smile. "Almost done," you hear yourself say.

And you mean it. And that's the part that frightens you.
