…you realize you need to start pretending you belong here.

You close your mouth before you can ask the boy in the rough linen shirt where the nearest Wi‑Fi is. He’s staring at you like you’ve already said something strange, eyes tracing the zipper on your hoodie as if it’s jewelry.

“Road’s that way,” he says finally, pointing with a stick. “If you’re looking for the village.”

Village. Right. Of course there’s a village.

You thank him, the word coming out awkward and too bright, and he jogs off toward a line of trees, bare feet thudding in the dirt.

You stand there for a moment, listening.

No engines. No power lines humming. No distant sirens or rumble of trucks. Just wind in tall grass, clucking chickens somewhere out of sight, and the faint, rhythmic clank of metal on metal. A blackbird cuts across the open sky like a scratch on a blue screen.

You pat your pockets out of habit. No phone. No keys. Not even a wallet. Just the clothes you went to sleep in—a T‑shirt with a peeling logo, your hoodie, sweatpants. You catch your reflection in a shallow puddle: too clean, too out of place.

You start walking.

The road is more a suggestion than a structure, packed dirt with wagon tracks baked into twin grooves. You follow it until the land dips and a cluster of houses appears—wood, stone, thatch. Smoke curls from holes in roofs, not chimneys. A dog barks, then thinks better of coming too close.

You realize you need to understand the rules here before you break any.

The first person who really sees you is an older woman filling buckets at a well. Her sleeves are rolled up, forearms knotted with muscle from a lifetime of hauling water that, in your world, would have come obediently out of a tap.

She looks you over, not in a hostile way, but with the calm suspicion of someone who has lived long enough to know that strange things never come alone.

“You’re not from around here,” she says.

You almost laugh. “That’s… complicated.”

She snorts, like that’s the most honest answer she’s heard all week. “Everyone’s from somewhere. Come. You look like you skipped a meal or three.”

You realize you need an ally, even if she thinks you’re a bit odd.

She leads you to a low house with a sagging roof and a door that sticks on the frame. Inside, the air is warm with the smell of soup—root vegetables, herbs, and something you can’t quite place. There’s a table that looks like it was carved out of a single, stubborn tree. She gestures for you to sit.

“You can call me Mara,” she says, ladling soup into a wooden bowl. “And you can pay me back later.”

“For the food?” you ask.

“For whatever else you decide you owe,” she replies. “Fate doesn’t send people here for nothing.”

You wrap your hands around the bowl. There’s no spoon, just a hunk of bread to dip and soak. It tastes better than anything dehydrated or microwaved ever has.

“Where is this?” you ask carefully. “I mean… what’s this place called?”

“Just ‘the village’ to us,” Mara says. “If you’re asking where in the world—north of the king’s road, south of the old ruins, far enough from the city that the lord’s men don’t bother us much. Yet.”

King’s road. Lord’s men. You feel something sink and settle in your chest.

“And what year is it?” you ask, then immediately realize your mistake. “I mean—how long since… uh… the last war?”

“Which one?” she counters, but she’s smiling faintly. “If you mean the king’s quarrel with his brother, four summers since it ended. If you mean the old war, the one no one remembers starting, then longer than you or I have been breathing.”

You realize you need information, but you can’t interrogate everyone like a malfunctioning time traveler. So you switch tactics.

“What do people do here?” you ask. “For work, I mean.”

“Work?” she echoes. “We grow. We make. We mend. Is there another kind?”

You think of screens and emails and jobs you can perform without moving more than your fingers. “Sometimes,” you say quietly. “Where I’m from.”

Mara’s eyes soften for a moment, as if she can see something frayed behind your words, even if she doesn’t understand it. “Well,” she says. “Here we grow, make, and mend. I tend the well, the sick, and occasionally people who fall out of nowhere and look lost.”

You flinch. “Do people… fall out of nowhere often?”

“Not often enough to make a trade of it,” she says. “But more than never.”

That answer sits in your bones like a key that almost fits a lock.

You realize you need to figure out whether this is a one‑way trip.

“Has anyone who ‘fell’ ever… gone back?” you ask.

She considers you over the rim of her own bowl. “Some say they did,” she says slowly. “One woke up by the old stone circle beyond the fields, screaming about trains made of iron and lights trapped in glass. Stayed a season, then vanished on a foggy morning. Another swore she came from a city where buildings scraped the sky. She left a bundle of sketches—strange towers, carriages without horses. Those are still under my bed, scaring mice.”

You feel suddenly, stupidly close to tears. “So there’s a way.”

“There are many ways,” Mara says. “Most of them we don’t see until we’ve walked past. Eat.”

You eat.

Later, when the bowl is empty and the warmth has soaked into your hands, Mara pushes a folded bit of cloth toward you. It’s a rough shirt, but clean and whole.

“You’ll draw less attention in this,” she says. “People won’t know what to make of those markings on your shirt.” She taps the faded logo. “And if you plan to ask questions, it’s better they don’t start by asking their own.”

You realize you need to let go of small things—your clothes, your habits—if you want to hold on to the bigger thing: yourself.

You change behind a hanging cloth while Mara stirs the pot again. The shirt scratches your skin, the trousers are too short, but when you step out and she nods approval, you feel weirdly safer.

“Go see the blacksmith,” she says. “He hears news from the road. And stay away from the lord’s men if they pass through. They like new faces for the wrong reasons.”

“Why are you helping me?” you ask.

Mara shrugs. “Once, a stranger helped me when I was lost. I didn’t understand how, or where she came from. I only remember she told me that one day, I’d recognize the same confusion on someone else’s face.” She gestures toward you. “Here you are.”

You step back out into the daylight. The village hums with a kind of organized chaos: people hauling sacks, children chasing each other, someone splitting logs with the calm precision of someone who doesn’t know what a gym is and doesn’t need to.

You realize you need to choose: cling to the idea of waking up in your old bed, or accept this as your new reality—for now.

So you head toward the sound of hammer on metal.

The blacksmith’s forge is a burst of heat at the edge of the village. Sparks dance like fireflies in daylight. The smith himself is huge, arms like tree trunks, face smeared with soot. He glances up as you approach.

“You’re Mara’s stray,” he rumbles.

“Apparently,” you say.

He grunts, which you take as acknowledgment.

“People say you hear stories from the road,” you venture. “From travelers. Things that don’t make sense.”

He pauses mid‑swing, hammer held above the glowing metal. Slowly, he sets it down.

“What kind of not making sense?” he asks.

You take a breath. Your heart is pounding in your ears.

“Stories about people who… don’t belong,” you say. “Who talk about… lights in glass. Towers of stone and steel. Voices carried in the air.”

He holds your gaze for a long moment, the fire’s reflection flickering in his eyes.

“Ah,” he says quietly. “You’re one of those.”

“One of what?” you press.

“Those who wake up wrong,” he replies. “In the wrong time. The wrong story.”

You swallow. “Do you know why?”

“Not why,” he says. “But I know where they all end up, one way or another.”

“Where?”

He lifts a hand and points past the fields, beyond the line of trees, to a faint rise in the distance where something stands—a ring of dark shapes, half‑swallowed by the landscape.

“The old stone circle,” he says. “Mara didn’t tell you everything, then. No one falls here by accident. When the time is right, you’ll go there.”

“And then?” you whisper.

He shrugs. “Then you decide. Go back. Go on. Or stay and let this become your only dream.”

A breeze rushes past, cooling your sweat, carrying the smell of smoke and earth and something ancient.

You realize you need to walk to that circle someday.

But not yet.

For now, you pick up the extra hammer the blacksmith offers you. It’s heavy, clumsy in your hand.

“First lesson,” he says. “If you’re staying long enough to ask questions, you’re staying long enough to learn a trade.”

You lift the hammer.

In some distant, unreachable room, your body might still be sleeping.

Here, in this other era with no modern technology, the hammer’s weight is real, the heat of the forge is real, and the faint pull in your chest—toward the stones on the hill, toward answers—is very, very real.

You swing.

The sound rings out, bright and sharp, and the world doesn’t quite wake up.

But you do.
