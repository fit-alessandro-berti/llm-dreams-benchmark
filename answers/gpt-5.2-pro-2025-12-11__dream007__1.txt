…step away before you say something you can’t take back.

You turn, expecting the hallway of your apartment, but you’re suddenly outside—standing in the exact place you first met them, except it’s wrong in the way dreams get things wrong. The sky is the color of old paper. The streetlights hum like distant bees. Every sound has a faint echo, as if the world is inside a seashell.

Your friend follows you anyway, their footsteps landing a half-second after yours, like the dream is struggling to keep up.

“Don’t walk away,” they say, but the words come out as a thin ribbon of smoke that twists in the air between you. You open your mouth to answer and realize your own words come out the same way—visible, curling, impossible to take back once they’ve left you.

You try anyway.

“I’m not walking away,” you say, and the smoke spells it, letter by letter, in front of your face. The letters tremble. You reach out, intending to smooth them, to make them mean what you meant, but your hand passes through, and the phrase rearranges itself into: *I’m not staying.*

Your friend’s eyes narrow the way they do when they feel cornered. “See? That’s what you always do.”

Something in you snaps—not rage, exactly, but the tired knot underneath it. You want to explain your reasons, your hurt, the part that always gets flattened when you argue. You want to be understood without having to earn it. The dream obliges, in the worst possible way.

A door appears in the air between you, freestanding, painted the same color as your friend’s front door. A little brass label reads: **WHAT YOU MEAN**.

Before you can stop yourself, you turn the knob.

On the other side is a small theater. Seats stretch into darkness. The stage is lit with a harsh, white light. And there you are—another you—standing under it, delivering your side of the argument with perfect clarity. It’s everything you wish you could say in the moment: coherent, calm, precise. It’s convincing.

You glance at your friend, expecting them to finally understand.

But they’re watching a different stage. From their angle, the spotlight falls on *them*, not you, and they’re saying their own version with the same perfect clarity. Their reasons are coherent too. Their hurt makes sense. Their fear has shape. Their voice doesn’t crack.

You both sit there, side by side, listening to yourselves make flawless cases to an audience that never interrupts. The applause comes from somewhere behind you, polite and hollow, like rain on plastic.

Your friend leans toward you in the dim. “That’s the problem,” they whisper. “You always want to be right in a way that makes me wrong.”

You flinch, because it lands—not because it’s entirely true, but because it’s not entirely false either.

The stage lights flicker. The two versions of you on stage stop mid-sentence, mouths open, stuck like paused video. The theater goes silent enough that you can hear your heartbeat and, underneath it, a thin ringing—as if something is about to break.

A new door appears, smaller, half-hidden beside your seat. This one has no label. It’s not painted. It looks older, like it’s been there for a long time. The handle is worn.

Your friend notices it at the same time. You both reach for it. Your hands overlap.

For a moment you both hesitate, as if you know that whatever is behind it isn’t an argument you can win.

You open it together.

On the other side is a kitchen you don’t recognize, lit by late-afternoon sun. There’s a table with two mugs, still steaming. A third chair sits pulled out, as if someone stood up quickly. On the counter is a stack of plates—clean, but not put away. Ordinary, domestic, unfinished.

And on the table, between the mugs, lies the thing you’ve been fighting about—except it isn’t the topic itself. It’s an object that stands in for it, the way dreams do: a small glass bowl full of water, so clear it’s almost invisible. In the water floats a folded paper boat.

You both stare at it, and you understand without words: the bowl is what you’re trying not to spill. The boat is what you’re both trying to keep afloat. The paper has gone soft at the edges.

Your friend reaches for the bowl, careful. “I’m scared,” they say, and the sentence doesn’t come out as smoke this time. It lands on the table like something real.

You swallow. The anger you were holding feels suddenly too heavy and too sharp to carry. “Me too,” you admit, and your voice surprises you by not cracking, by not becoming a speech.

Outside the kitchen window, the world shifts. The old-paper sky brightens, then darkens, like someone is turning pages too fast. The humming streetlights fade. In their place, you hear water running somewhere—steady, patient.

Your friend looks at you as if they’re waiting for you to choose the familiar ending: the escalation, the retreat, the silence. You can feel the argument trying to reassemble itself in your mouth, ready-made.

Instead, you do something smaller.

You slide your mug toward them.

They watch you, suspicious, then take it. Their fingers brush yours. The touch is so ordinary that it feels like a miracle.

The paper boat in the bowl tips, rights itself, then drifts in a slow circle.

“Okay,” your friend says, not as agreement, but as a door left unlocked. “Okay.”

You nod, and your throat tightens, because the dream is offering you a version of this moment with no perfect resolution, just the fragile decision to stay present.

You both sit down.

The kitchen light warms, thickens, turns golden. The chairs creak. Somewhere in another room, a clock ticks loudly enough to be a warning.

Your friend opens their mouth to speak again, and you lean in, ready to listen—

—and the entire scene shudders, as if someone grabbed the edges of the dream and shook it.

The bowl on the table ripples. The paper boat blurs. The ticking grows louder, louder, until it becomes a single, insistent sound.

Your eyes snap open in your own bed.

For a second you can still feel the warmth of the mug in your hands, the weight of that “okay” between you. Your phone buzzes on the nightstand with a notification you haven’t read yet.

In the silence, you realize your jaw is sore, as if you’ve been clenching it all night.

You stare at the ceiling, heart steadying.

Then you reach for your phone, not to argue, not to win—just to begin, carefully, with something that won’t turn into smoke.
