...panic.  Not a full-blown meltdown, thankfully, but the kind of creeping, cold dread that settles in your gut like a rogue raindrop, heavy and unsettling. My watch, which I vaguely remember being a crucial part of navigating this strange world, was missing.  

My heart hammered in my chest. A meeting. An important one. I could sense it, even in this blurry dreamscape.  But where?

I frantically searched my pockets, feeling the disorienting panic churn into icy fear as they hung empty. Panic gnawed at me. No time for disillusionment, I had to pull myself together! I remember seeing a sleek, silver hovercar pull up to the curb outside the dim café I'd ended up in front of.

The café's warmth, a stark contrast to the looming terror of my deadline, was my only clue to where I needed to be.  I weave through a pulsating throng of people in a marketplace crammed into luminous alleyways, crowded stalls lining both sides.  The vendors hawk glowing citrus fruits and silks that shimmer with stardust.  One cries out, "Get your sonic lemons, five a stem!" while a woman across from him displays garments woven with iridescent threads "They catch the moonlight just right!"

I search the crowded marketplace for a sign indicating where I’m supposed to be. People bustling around me look vaguely familiar, like blurry memories from a forgotten youth.  They wear clothes similar to those in the holographic stall display, "Active Crystalline Shimmer Weave: Question Emoji – Is this real, or...?"

A voice interrupts my observation, a thin, young man with nervous eyes and fidgeting hands. A holographic map floats in front of me, pixelated, unclear – a technology glitch, I suspect, the mins skipping, blurring, the stylized lines swirling into disorienting shapes. 'Where are these damn zeroes?!’ I want to yell. A meeting. A crucial meeting. I need to get there, but I don’t even recognize this place clearly enough to remember. 




My hand tingles. I remember the meeting!

I’m in the city for a business deal, to hand off a project to a shadowy figure behind a locked booth.  It was supposed to be the procurement of a valuable diamond, but he was someone else?

“...for a woman, there’s no way I’d tell anyone that, even in my loose-lipped narratives I have to be careful who I talk to and what I say," I muttered, my voice barely a whisper.  The woman across from me beamed, raising her jeweled hand.

"This renowned cartographer," she said, her voice bright & sharp, seeming to echo around me, "is said to be able to create maps for anything.  

Anything?"

"Anything!" she winked, "Don't tell me you don't feel that nervous chill running down your spine?"

I sighed. She’d done it again - blurry visions flashing through her mind, a thrilling map trickling in. The words “You can’t get to her” flickered in the woman’s bubble of travelling thoughts Blithely passing her by. I know we were talking through whisps, but a diamond delivery...” The words barely registered; it's  a familiar scene, a conglomeration of fragmented dreams. 
Where was I going? I don’t need a physical object.

"Ah, but it was object lesson time,” the woman’s voice reverberated in the air, swirling up again like a dust devil, swirling around my mind fewer but brighter sparks flitted by, "a task, a purpose," the woman thought of the young man, striving to be a tycoon - their first meeting in the dimly lit marketplace. My fingers tapped on the map screen blindly, the seller her name pleats, it seemed he recognized the layer of fear spreading across our shared dreamscape. 

I don't want to let fear lead my subconscious mind.

"I’m just… worried,” I said to the empty air of the screen, the vibrancy of my childhood dreams fading along with the fading question. "What if he wants to steal the design from me?"

The woman across from me, my familiar guide...


...through these virtual markets of memory, chuckled. "The vendor fears is enough to make your head spin? The troubles of his mind using the mind of your fairy-tale and growing more less clear?'

 “...More like the whispers of the fear she might not be the only one who tried to steal my idea."

She smiles and raises an eyebrow. How to recognize this, the Dream Weaver’s shop?" I shake my head, it was just a verbal echo of the thought, " …I spend so many hours nurturing a precise vision.

She trails off, the scent of ripe bullion onions from a lingering dream wafting around me. The woman wasn’t sure if she wanted to laugh or cry. Her mind was filled with anxieties the bustling marketplace threatens to awaken one of my darkest fears – betrayal.

What’s my comment going to be.?

Create a story through my mists of fear, that's what his intention had been exactly! "I am not … a resource to be pillaged," cried a faded inscription in a corner of the dream-scape.

I stumbled through the thick fog, each swirling angel cloud, a significant reminder of the "For you it is impossible … your image clear to the compound search?" I muttered to myself.
"It has to be," a small voice in the back of my mind cackled cravenly, "Live rent free in the theater of…"
