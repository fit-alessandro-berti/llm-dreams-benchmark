…find the stones before the sun sets.

The realization hits like cold water—not the panic of displacement, but a deep, bone-certain knowledge that I have until dusk to locate three specific standing stones arranged in a crescent, or I’ll be trapped here forever. My modern mind screams that this is impossible, irrational, yet my hands know the weight of the flint knife in my palm, and my feet recognize the deer-path through this primeval forest.

The air smells of pine resin and woodsmoke from a distant settlement I haven't dared approach. I’m wearing rough-spun wool, not my pajamas. When I touch my face, there’s a pattern painted across my cheekbones—ochre and woad—that I don’t remember applying, but which marks me as belonging to the tribe that watches me from the shadows of the birch trees.

They’re waiting to see if I’ll run, or if I’ll remember the words. The words I knew in my dream within this dream, the ones that explained why I was sent back to this threshold moment in human history. I need to find the stones, yes, but more importantly, I need to remember what I’m supposed to bury beneath the middle one—a piece of technology I must have brought with me, though my pockets feel empty, or perhaps a thought, a crucial idea that hasn’t been invented yet but must be planted here, in this soil, to ensure the timeline unfolds correctly.

The sun is already past its zenith. I have perhaps four hours. And I can hear drums beginning to beat from the valley below, warning that the boundary between now and then is already starting to fray.
