The intricate patterns on the box weren't just etched metal; they seemed to shift and writhe like living vines frozen in time. As you traced a swirling line with your fingertip, the metal beneath grew unnaturally **cold**, almost sucking the warmth from your skin. Suddenly, the pattern you were touching **pulsed** with a faint, deep blue light, and a low, resonant **hum** vibrated through the box, making your bones feel like they were subtly shaking.

You leaned closer, your breath fogging the air near the box's surface. The intricate designs coalesced, forming a single, complex symbol near the center – an **eye** within a labyrinthine spiral. As you watched, the symbol itself began to **glow**, and the air around the box shimmered like heat haze on a summer road.

Then, you noticed it: a tiny, perfectly circular **keyhole**, hidden within the pupil of the glowing eye. It was impossibly small, no larger than a pinhead, yet it seemed to pulse with the same deep blue light as the patterns. There was no key in sight, but the hum grew slightly louder, almost like a whisper saying, *"Look closer..."*

**What do you do next?**

1.  **Examine the keyhole:** Get very close, trying to see if there's anything inside the tiny opening or if it reacts to your touch.
2.  **Touch the glowing eye symbol:** Press your fingertip against the symbol, feeling for any mechanism or reaction.
3.  **Step back and observe:** Watch the patterns and the humming, trying to discern if there's a rhythm or code to the light pulses.
4.  **Look for hidden mechanisms:** Search the box's surface again, running your hands along the edges and seams, feeling for any buttons, levers, or disguised panels.
5.  **Listen intently:** Close your eyes and focus solely on the humming, trying to decipher if it's a language, a warning, or a lure.
