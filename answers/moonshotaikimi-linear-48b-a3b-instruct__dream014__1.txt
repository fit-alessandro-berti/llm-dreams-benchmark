…they start walking with me, a small parade of mismatched souls, the kind you only find in dreams. One carries a sky-blue balloon that never seems to lose air; another hums a tune that sounds exactly like your childhood home before you moved. They don’t ask questions, just gesture—left here, up the glass steps, into a warmly lit subway car painted with cinnamon stars.  

As we descend, the city’s crowds fade to soft wool. The train lights flicker like fireflies, and every station we glide past shows a slice of my past birthdays: fifth-grade candles, dorm rooftop confetti, the quiet kitchen on my thirtieth with no guests. The strangers smile, never speaking, but their eyes say, “We know the way by heart because we’ve each lost it before.”  

At the last stop, the doors open onto a quiet street I’ve never seen yet somehow recognize. A small café glows from the corner; through the window, a single table for four is already set, my name on a napkin in looping handwriting I swear is mine. The balloon carrier hands me the string. The humming stops. They bow—nothing terrifying, just a soft tilt of the head like old friends closing a circle—and dissolve into the smell of coffee and warm bread.  

I sit. The chair feels familiar. Outside, the city keeps pulsing, but here, time has folded in on itself. On the table rests a postcard with no stamp, addressed to me in the same looping hand. It shows the city in daylight, but in the sky where there should be clouds, there’s a single, constant ladder of light leading somewhere I can’t name.  

I look down. My shoes have become soft slippers. Above me, the strangers’ balloon drifts up through the ceiling, silver string spiraling, taking my heartbeat with it. I lift my hand, not to stop it, but to follow the pulse up through my chest and out of me, past the steam of tea, past the blurred faces of sleeping strangers, until the whole dream feels braided with the balloon’s quiet ascent.
