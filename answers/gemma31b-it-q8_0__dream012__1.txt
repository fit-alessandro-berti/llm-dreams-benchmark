You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you… you clutch the rough wooden wheel, your hands still slick with salt. The storm isn't just water and wind, it’s laced with a palpable sense of malice – shadows ripple across the waves, and ghostly faces coalesce within the driving rain. The wind shrieks a frantic, desperate melody. 

For a heartbeat, you fight the pull of disorientation. You thought you were perfectly anchored, trusting in your instincts and the weathered stability of the *Sea Serpent*. But the storm… it *feels* wrong. Older. More alive than anything you’ ve ever experienced. 

Then, an inscription glows faintly into being on your chronometer - a faded, ancient glyph you’re not sure you recognize. As if illuminated by some inner force, you hear it. A single, fragmented voice whispering from the waves, “**Remember what you swore. Bury the serpent's tooth.**”

Suddenly, the water beneath your feet shifts, becoming a black abyss. A colossal shape, a serpent forged from solidified foam and shadows, rises from the depths, its scales catching the flashes of the lightning. Its single eye, vast and ancient, focuses directly on you. You feel its cold indifference, an absolute, crushing emptiness. 

You realize the crew... they seem… muted, distant. Their faces are blank slanes, reacting mechanically to the wind and rain.  They’re not shouting commands, they’re simply *watching*.  The air thickens with a floral, sickening sweetness. 

The inscription demands action. You remember, not fully, but a flicker… a ghost of a memory – your father, a young marine, telling you about a long-lost, submerged ruin marked by a single, impossibly large tooth. A tooth that protects a *thing*.  

Desperation fuels you. You take a slow, deliberate stroke of the wheel.  The *Sea Serpent* isn’t navigating through the storm, it’s fighting *through* it, drawn towards a point in the heart of the swirling dark. You shout into the raging wind, "To the Serpent's Tooth! Now!”

As you push the ship forward, a single, luminous pearl erupts from within the shadows of the serpent's mouth, sinking like a beacon into the swirling waters. As the pearl lands, the face of the serpent softens. It doesn't attack.  It *listens*.
