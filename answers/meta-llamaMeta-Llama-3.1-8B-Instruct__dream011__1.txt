 yiy... okay, I can take over from here...

As I sit down at my desk, I glance at the exam in front of me and my heart sinks. The questions are... not what I expected. Instead of being about the course material, they're a mix of ridiculously obscure pop culture references, bizarre math problems, and philosophical questions that seem to defy logic.

One question reads: "What would happen if a rogue pineapple suddenly appeared in the middle of Times Square during rush hour?" Another asks me to calculate the exact velocity of a flamingo's waddle over a given distance, while a third question demands that I define the phrase " existential dread" in 50 words or less.

I look around the room, hoping that maybe everyone else has seen this too and we're all just playing some kind of prank on the professor. But everyone else seems just as perplexed as I am,their faces contorted in confusion.

I take a deep breath and try to focus. Maybe this is some kind of weird exam designed to test our creativity or ability to think outside the box. I start to scribble down random answers, hoping against hope that one of them will magically be correct.

As I write, the room begins to shift and distort around me, like a Salvador Dali painting come to life. The seats and tables start to melt like wax, and the other students begin to transform into various forms of Denver public transportation (a bus here, a light rail train there, an errant streetcar in the corner). I feel my own body start to blur and change, my limbs stretching and morphing like a rubber band.

The questions on the exam page start to flutter and whirl around me, like a swarm of butterflies on a summer breeze. I'm starting to lose track of what's real and what's not, but I know I have to keep trying. My future career depends on it...

 Wait, what was the question again?
