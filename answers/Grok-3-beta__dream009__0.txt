adapt to the customs and ways of life in this unfamiliar time. You find yourself in what appears to be a medieval village, surrounded by thatched-roof cottages, cobblestone paths, and people dressed in simple, handwoven garments. The air smells of woodsmoke and fresh earth, and the distant sound of a blacksmith hammering echoes through the village square.

As you wander, curious eyes follow you. Your modern clothes—jeans and a t-shirt—stand out like a sore thumb, drawing whispers and wary glances from the villagers. You quickly realize that blending in is essential if you want to avoid suspicion. You approach a kind-looking woman carrying a basket of bread and, with a nervous smile, ask where you might find some appropriate clothing. She hesitates at first, eyeing you strangely, but eventually points you toward a tailor’s shop at the edge of the village.

At the tailor’s, a gruff old man with a measuring tape around his neck sizes you up. He doesn’t ask many questions, thankfully, and after bartering with a small trinket from your pocket (a keychain that fascinates him), he agrees to outfit you in a rough linen tunic and breeches. As you change, you catch a glimpse of yourself in a small, cracked mirror and barely recognize the person staring back. You’re starting to look the part, but you know fitting in will take more than just the right clothes.

Your next challenge is figuring out how to survive in this era. You have no money, no skills suited for this time, and no idea how to navigate the social hierarchy. You decide to head to the village square, where a small market is bustling with activity. Merchants hawk their wares—fresh produce, handmade tools, and livestock—while children dart through the crowd, laughing. You overhear a conversation about a local lord seeking workers for the upcoming harvest. It’s hard labor, but it might be your best chance to earn a living and learn the ways of this world.

With a deep breath, you approach the man organizing the workers, a burly fellow with a weathered face. You muster up your courage and offer your help, claiming to be a traveler seeking honest work. He looks you over skeptically but eventually nods, saying, “We’ll see if you’ve got the grit for it. Be at the fields at dawn.”

As the sun begins to set, casting a golden glow over the village, you find a spot to rest under a large oak tree just outside the market. Your stomach growls—food is another problem you’ll need to solve soon. But for now, you watch the villagers go about their evening routines, feeling a strange mix of fear and excitement. You’re in a world so different from your own, yet there’s a simplicity and rawness to it that feels oddly invigorating.

As you lie back against the tree, staring up at the darkening sky, a thought crosses your mind: How did you get here? And more importantly, will you ever find a way back? Just as you ponder this, a shadowy figure approaches from the edge of the woods, their face obscured by a hooded cloak. They stop a few feet away and, in a low, mysterious voice, say, “You don’t belong here, do you?”

Your heart races. Who is this person, and what do they know about you? Before you can respond, the figure gestures for you to follow them into the woods, promising answers to the questions burning in your mind. Do you trust them and follow, or do you stay in the safety of the village, hoping to carve out a life in this strange new world?

The choice is yours as the dream continues to unfold...
