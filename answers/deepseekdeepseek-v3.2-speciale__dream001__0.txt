You start to reach for your phone, but your pocket is empty. A sense of urgency propels you forward, and you begin to run through the labyrinthine streets, each turn leading to a more distorted version of the city. The buildings lean in, their windows reflecting a clock face with hands spinning wildly. You try to ask a policeman, but his uniform melts into a carnival costume, and he hands you a ticket that reads "Meeting: Platform 9¾." Suddenly, a train appears on the street, its doors sliding open. Inside, the passengers are all wearing masks of your own face. As the train departs, you realize you are both the conductor and the passenger, and the meeting is already happening—within you.
