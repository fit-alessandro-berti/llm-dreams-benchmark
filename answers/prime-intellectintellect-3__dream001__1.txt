You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to **panic, your heart hammering against your ribs. Glancing around, the cityscape looms alien – towering glass spires reflecting the harsh midday sun, streets gridlike but devoid of any familiar landmarks. Your phone, your lifeline, is dead in your pocket.**

You duck into the shadow of a sleek building facade, pressing your back against the cool glass. *Think. Think.* Where *was* the meeting? A vague memory surfaces – a name: "Veridian Solutions." Was it downtown? In the financial district? A tech park on the outskirts? The name means nothing geographically.

You spot a taxi stand half a block away, a cluster of yellow cars like lifeboats. Hope surges. You jog towards them, dodging pedestrians who seem to move with purposeful ease you lack. "Taxi!" you call out, waving frantically at the first available car. The driver, a weary-looking man with kind eyes, pulls over.

"Where to?" he asks, the window crackling slightly.
"Veridian Solutions!" you blurt, throwing yourself into the back seat. "Do you know where that is?"
The driver hesitates, tapping the steering wheel. "Hmm. Veridian... Sounds familiar. Might be in the Nexus Tower. Big building, kinda triangular, near the riverfront."
"Great! Nexus Tower, riverfront!" you confirm, relief washing over you. You glance at the dashboard clock – 45 minutes left.

The taxi merges into the flowing, chaotic river of traffic. You watch the unfamiliar streets slip by – trendy cafes with outdoor seating, minimalist galleries, crowds of people dressed in sharp, modern attire. The city feels vibrant, efficient, and utterly indifferent to your personal crisis. You fumble in your bag, pulling out a crumpled business card – the only tangible clue. "Veridian Solutions, Suite 1500, Nexus Tower," it reads. *Suite 1500. Good to know.*

The driver navigates expertly, the city beginning to shift character. The buildings grow taller, more imposing. The river appears, a wide, grey expanse dotted with pleasure boats. Then, cutting the skyline like a shard of dark glass, you see it: **Nexus Tower.** A massive, angular structure rising from the waterfront. "There!" you point, pressing your nose against the window.

The taxi pulls up to a grand, multi-level entrance. You leap out, fumbling for cash. "Keep the change!" you yell, already sprinting towards the revolving doors. Inside, the lobby is cavernous, polished stone floors reflecting the buzz of activity. A towering reception desk manned by a sleekly dressed concierge.

"Veridian Solutions, please!" you gasp to the woman behind the desk, leaning on the marble. "I have a meeting... in ten minutes!"
She gives a cool, appraising look. "Of course. Elevators are on your right. Take the express to the 15th floor. Veridian is in the east wing, Suite 1500." She points a perfectly manicured finger.

You dash towards the bank of elevators, a wave of desperate energy propelling you. A sleek, empty car opens immediately. You stumble inside, jabbing the button marked '15'. The doors slide shut with a soft hiss. You collapse against the mirrored wall, catching your breath, watching the floor numbers tick upwards: 2... 4... 7... 12... 14... 15.

The doors glide open onto a wide, minimalist corridor. Plush carpeting muffles your frantic footsteps. You scan the directory on the wall: East Wing... Veridian Solutions... Suite 1500... straight ahead. You sprint down the hall, turning the corner. There it is: a frosted glass door with the name etched in silver: **Veridian Solutions.**

You skid to a halt outside Suite 1500, your hand trembling as you reach for the handle. It's locked. You check your watch – 10 minutes until the meeting. *They must be in the conference room.* You look desperately down the empty corridor. Then, you spot a small side door labeled 'Reception'. You dive for it, finding it unlocked.

Inside, a small, quiet reception area. A single desk with a computer. No one is there. Your pulse is a drumbeat in your ears. You see a door slightly ajar, revealing a conference room with a large table. Through the gap, you see them: three people sitting, looking at a presentation screen. *They're already here.*

Panic floods you again. You need to be *in* that room *now*. You spot a coffee station – a fresh pot. Grabbing a cup, you take a deep breath, square your shoulders, and push open the conference room door. "Sorry I'm late!" you blurt, your voice echoing slightly. "So sorry! Directions were... tricky."

The three faces turn towards you. They are expressionless. The man at the head of the table clears his throat. "Ah. We were just about to start. Please, take your seat." He gestures to a single empty chair at the far end of the imposing table.

You hurry towards it, coffee sloshing precariously. As you pass the head of the table, you glance at the presentation screen. It's a blueprint... of a city... a city that looks *exactly* like the one you just navigated. The title reads: **Project Nexus: Urban Navigation & Wayfinding.**

You freeze mid-step, your coffee cup halfway to your lips. The dream suddenly feels sharper, more real, yet utterly absurd. The faces at the table seem to blur. You look down at your watch – it shows 1 minute until the meeting start time. You look back at the screen, then at the door you just entered through. The faces are still watching you, expectantly. The coffee in your cup is steaming.

**What happens next?** (The dream is yours to shape.)
