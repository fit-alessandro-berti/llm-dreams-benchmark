As you examine the locked box more closely, you notice intricate patterns etched into the surface. The patterns seem to shift and change as you look at them, almost as if they're alive. You try to trace them with your fingers, but they seem to slip away, leaving no impression.

Suddenly, you hear a soft whisper echoing through the room. The voice seems to come from all directions at once, and it speaks in a language you don't understand. You strain to listen, trying to make sense of the words. The voice seems to be guiding you, telling you to look closer, to listen harder.

You turn your attention back to the box. As you do, you notice that the patterns have started to glow softly. They pulse in time with the voice, and you feel a strange sensation in your chest, as if something is trying to rise up from within you.

The voice grows louder, more insistent. It tells you that the box is not locked in the way you think. It tells you that the key is within you, hidden away from the world. It tells you to look deeper, to find the truth that lies hidden within.

You close your eyes, taking a deep breath. As you do, you feel a sudden surge of energy, and the patterns on the box seem to fade away, replaced by a single, glowing symbol. It's a circle, with a dot in the center, and it pulses gently in time with your heartbeat.

You open your eyes, and the voice is silent. The box is still there, but the patterns have disappeared, and the box seems to beckon you to open it. You reach out, your hand hovering over the lid, and you feel a sudden, overwhelming urge to open it.

But as your hand touches the box, you feel a sharp pain, and everything goes black.
