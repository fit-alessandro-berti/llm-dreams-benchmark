You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to run.

The streets twist in ways that don't make sense—corners curve into staircases, alleyways open onto waterfronts, and the architecture shifts from glass towers to crumbling stone as you pass beneath an archway. Your reflection catches in a window, but the face looking back isn't quite yours. Older. Or maybe younger. It's hard to tell in the amber light of streetlamps that haven't turned on yet, even though the sky is darkening.

You pull out your phone. No signal. The map app shows only a pulsing blue dot, stranded in a white void. Somewhere behind you, a clock tower chimes—not the hour, but a single, hollow note, like a bell far underwater.

A stranger in a long coat stops beside you. "You're lost," she says. It's not a question.

"I'm not lost," you say, though you are. "I have a meeting."

She smiles, and her teeth are too even, too numerous. "Everyone has a meeting. But this city doesn't appear on any map except the one you carry inside you." She points down the street, where the pavement dissolves into cobblestones, then sand, then something that looks like frozen lightning. "The building has a red door. You can't miss it."

You run toward it. The door finds you instead.

You wake up.

Would you like to continue the dream? Or wake up fully? I can take this in many directions—mystery, surrealism, urgency, or even turn it into something else entirely. What feels right to you?
