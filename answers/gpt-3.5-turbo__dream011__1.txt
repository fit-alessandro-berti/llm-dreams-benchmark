 all in a language you don't understand. Panicking, you look around the room for someone to help, but everyone else seems to be working diligently on their own exams. Your heart races as you try to make sense of the foreign words on the page.

Just when you're on the brink of giving up, a figure appears at your side. It's a wise-looking elderly woman with gentle eyes and a kind smile. She motions for you to follow her to a quiet corner of the room.

In a soft voice, the woman explains that she is a dream guide sent to help you navigate this challenging situation. She tells you to close your eyes and take a deep breath, visualizing a calm ocean. As you do so, the words on the exam paper begin to transform, shifting into a language you can understand.

With a newfound sense of confidence, you dive into the exam questions, answering each one with ease and clarity. The elderly woman nods approvingly as you work, offering words of encouragement and guidance when needed.

Finally, you reach the last question and confidently fill in the answer. The exam papers disappear, and the room fades away as you wake up from your dream feeling empowered and ready to face any challenge that comes your way.
