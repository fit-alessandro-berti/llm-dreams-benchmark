... start to panic slightly, the anonymous facades of the buildings seeming to clamor at you. You look down at your watch – 11:15 AM. An hour? That's barely enough time, especially here. You pull out your phone, hoping desperately for a signal or a useful app, but the screen remains eerily blank, or maybe it's just static – fuzzy, undecipherable information.

Sweat begins to bead on your forehead. You look around frantically. People rush past you, purposeful, ignoring your sudden feelings of unease and disorientation. Should you ask? But who? Who would you even ask? You don't even know the city's language, you realize with a fresh wave of dread – the signs above shops blurring together in indecipherable script.

You quicken your pace, weaving through a bustling market square filled with strange fruits, colorful textiles, and exotic smells that assault your senses. The market noise – shouting vendors, laughing customers, foreign music – becomes a wall that muffles your thoughts, making coherent thinking impossible.

Then you stop, breathing heavily. The market seems like a dead end. You back out, onto a wide, glowing street illuminated by the low slant of the sun, casting long shadows from buildings so high they seem to scrape invisible clouds. The street lamps pulse with a dim, soft light even in the day.

You have to find someone, find *something*. You spot a small, plain kiosk tucked between a towering skyscraper and a chaotic looking open-air cafe. Maybe the shopkeeper? You approach hesitantly, trying to look determined, not desperate. He's an old man,weathered, with tired eyes and a kettle in hand. You hesitate, about to speak your brief encounter it seems will be cut short as he simply pushes a worn, folded piece of paper towards you. You practically inhale it. Your eyes scan it – a scrawled map, some street names, an arrow, a time scribbled like a threat.

Your blood runs cold. The map isn't complex, but it leads somewhere... unsettling. And the time isn't 1 PM. It's 12:30. You have less than fifteen minutes.
