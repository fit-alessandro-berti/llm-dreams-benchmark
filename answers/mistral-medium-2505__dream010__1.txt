**Dream Continuation:**

As the competition progresses, you face various challenges—each one more surreal and symbolic than the last. The first test is a maze of shifting walls, where the path forward only appears when you trust your instincts rather than logic. You emerge victorious, but the next trial is even stranger: a room where time flows backward, and you must solve a puzzle by "unsolving" it.

Then comes the final challenge—a mirror that reflects not your face, but your deepest fears and insecurities. The judges explain that the grand prize isn’t just the job; it’s the version of yourself who can face these shadows without flinching. As you stare into the mirror, the reflection begins to speak, whispering doubts you’ve carried for years. But instead of looking away, you step forward, reaching out to touch the glass.

The moment your fingers meet the surface, the mirror shatters—and you wake up.

But when you open your eyes, you’re not in your bed. You’re standing in an unfamiliar office, dressed in the exact outfit you imagined for your dream job. A voice over the intercom welcomes you to your first day. The dream wasn’t just a dream—it was the test all along.

**The End.**
