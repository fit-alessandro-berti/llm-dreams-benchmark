As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and feel a bit overwhelmed. You notice a group of people laughing and having a great time, and you wonder if you should try to approach them and join in. You take a deep breath and make your way towards them, but as you get closer, you realize that they're all very animated and focused on their own conversation.

Feeling a bit discouraged, you decide to mingle a bit more and try to find someone else to talk to. You pass by a group of people engrossed in a game of cards, and you stop to observe for a moment. One of the players notices you and waves you over. You join in, and it turns out they're playing poker. You're not a natural card player, but you give it a shot and surprisingly find that you're having a blast.

As you're playing, you notice a few familiar faces wandering through the crowd. One of them is the person you came to the party to find. You catch their eye and wave them over to your table, and before you know it, your poker game has turned into a lively chat with several people you didn't even know before.

The night continues on, and you find yourself laughing and mingling with people you wouldn't have met if you hadn't taken a chance and approached that group of poker players. You realize that sometimes, all it takes is a small step out of your comfort zone to make new friends and create memorable moments.
