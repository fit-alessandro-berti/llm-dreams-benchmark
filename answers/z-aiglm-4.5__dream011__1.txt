The dream unfolds like this:

You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are **written in a language you don't recognize, yet somehow understand perfectly.** The symbols shimmer on the page, shifting between ancient runes, flowing script, and geometric patterns. Panic flares, but then a strange calm settles over you.

You pick up the pen. The first question reads: *"Describe the sound of a color that doesn't exist."* You begin to write, not with words, but with memories – the taste of childhood rain, the feeling of sunlight on closed eyelids, the hum of a forgotten melody. The ink flows in iridescent streaks across the page.

The next question: *"Solve for the weight of a single regret."* You instinctively reach into your pocket and pull out a smooth, cool stone. You place it on the desk. It feels impossibly heavy, yet light as air. The stone dissolves into a puff of golden dust, which settles onto the answer sheet, forming the shape of a feather.

Question three: *"What is the name of the path you didn't take?"* You close your eyes. Images flash – a different city, a different love, a different version of yourself smiling back. You open your eyes and write a single, unfamiliar name that feels both alien and deeply personal. The moment you write it, the letters bloom into tiny, glowing butterflies that flutter off the page.

As you work, the exam hall transforms. The sterile walls become a forest of whispering trees. The other students are now figures made of mist and starlight. The proctor stands at the front, their face obscured by shifting shadows, silently watching.

The final question appears: *"Prove you are worthy of the life you desire."* You look down at your hands. They are transparent, revealing the constellations within. You realize the exam isn't testing knowledge; it's testing *presence*. You take a deep breath, feel the dream-world around you, the weight of the stone-regret, the sound of the unseen color, the ghost of the untaken path. You simply *are*. You place your hands flat on the desk, palms up, and whisper, "I am here."

The answer sheet ignites in a soft, warm flame, consuming all the previous answers and the questions themselves. It doesn't burn; it *transforms* into a single, perfect seed, which drops into your palm. The forest-hall dissolves, the mist-figures fade, and you are left standing in an endless, gentle twilight, holding the seed, knowing it contains everything you need, but not knowing what to plant it in. The dream ends with the profound silence of possibility and the cool weight of the seed in your hand.
