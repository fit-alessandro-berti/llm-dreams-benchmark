As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and **shifting constellations carved into the lid, glowing with a faint, bioluminescent pulse that seems to breathe in time with your own heartbeat.**

The wood beneath your fingertips feels warm, almost like living skin, and the air around you suddenly smells of ozone and old rain. You realize the "lock" isn't a physical mechanism at all; there is no keyhole. Instead, the patterns rearrange themselves as you focus on them, forming a riddle written in a language you've never seen but somehow understand perfectly: *"To open what is sealed, you must first surrender the weight you carry."*

Confused, you look down at your hands and realize you are still holding a heavy, rusted anchor from a previous fragment of this dream—a symbol of a worry you've been carrying in your waking life. The moment you consciously decide to let go, allowing the anchor to dissolve into mist, the box clicks open with a sound like a distant bell tolling.

Inside, there is no gold or jewel. Instead, a small, perfect sphere of captured starlight floats upward, expanding until it envelops you, lifting you gently off the ground as the dream landscape below transforms into a vast, serene ocean under a sky filled with unfamiliar, colorful moons. You are no longer searching; you are simply floating, weightless and free.
