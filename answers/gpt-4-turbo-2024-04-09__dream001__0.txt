panic a little as you look around at the towering skyscrapers and bustling street corners, all teeming with people going about their daily lives. You pull your phone from your pocket to check the address, but as you do, the screen glitches and flickers out, leaving you with no means to check your email for the location.

Feeling a sense of urgency, you decide to approach someone for help. You spot a kindly-looking elderly man feeding some pigeons at a nearby bench. As you walk over to ask for directions, the ground suddenly feels unsteady, like walking on a trampoline. You glance down and to your surprise, the pavement is softly bouncing with each step you take.

Shaking off the bizarre feeling, you reach the man, who turns to you with a warm smile. "Excuse me, sir," you begin, "I’m supposed to have a very important meeting but I can’t seem to find the place."

The man listens intently then points to a large, ornate building across the busy intersection. "You might find what you're looking for over there," he explains, his voice echoing oddly, almost musically. "But to get there, you'll need to ride the Skyline."

Puzzled, you thank him and head in the direction he pointed. As you get closer, you notice people stepping onto shimmering platforms that whisk them upwards into the air, travelling along glowing blue lines that stretch between buildings, like futuristic trams. You hesitantly step onto one of these platforms. As it ascends, the cityscape extends infinitely around you, bathed in the golden hues of the setting sun.

You disembark at the building the man indicated. Inside, the lobby is grand and bustling with creatures you’ve never seen before – beings with shimmering wings, others cloaked in subtle glows, and some who seem just ordinary humans. A large digital panel lists a meeting under your name, projecting an arrow that guides you through intricate corridors filled with lush green plants and soft ambient music.

Finally, you reach the designated conference room. The door slides open silently, revealing a round table surrounded by diverse individuals, all who turn to greet you with knowing smiles. You take a deep breath, feeling suddenly at ease despite the strangeness of it all. As you step forward to join them, you realize the meeting is about sharing ideas to enhance interdimensional travel, and you have just experienced your first unintended journey. Your heart races with excitement rather than fear as you prepare to explore the possibilities of this new reality.
