You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to take a deep breath, letting the calm wash over you. You adjust the microphone, smile warmly, and start with a gentle joke to break the ice, easing into your topic with confidence. The audience chuckles, relaxing and becoming more engaged as you proceed. You feel a surge of energy from their positive response, and you know this is going to be a great speech.
