You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to run, your shoes slapping against cobblestones that seem to shift beneath your feet, as if the street itself is alive. The buildings stretch impossibly high, their windows flickering with ghostly light, and the air hums with a low, resonant frequency that vibrates in your bones.  

A neon sign ahead pulses with the words *“Ecliptica Lounge – Time is Relative”*—but when you glance back, the street you came from is gone, replaced by a bridge of glass suspended over a chasm of swirling stars. You freeze, heart racing, as a clocktower materializes nearby, its hands spinning backward. A figure in a tailcoat materializes beside you, holding a pocket watch that glows with your own face inside it.  

“Lost, are we?” they murmur, their voice a chorus of echoes. “The meeting’s not a place. It’s a *question*.”  

Before you can ask, the bridge shudders, and the stars below begin to coalesce into a map—your childhood home, your first kiss, a forgotten argument—all blurring into a single point: a door at the end of the bridge, unmarked, trembling as if afraid to be opened.  

You take a breath, step forward, and the world dissolves into a kaleidoscope of light.
