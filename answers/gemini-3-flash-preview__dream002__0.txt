The air thickens, smelling suddenly of ozone and crushed mint. The vibrant green canopy above bruises into a deep, electric violet, and the silence of the woods is replaced by a low, rhythmic hum that vibrates in my chest. 

I feel the storm approaching, and instead of cold rain, the wind brings a shower of glowing, white petals that defy gravity, swirling upward toward the clouds. As the first crack of thunder echoes, it doesn't sound like a crash—it sounds like a single, resonant note played on a massive cello. 

I start to run, but my feet barely touch the moss. With every stride, I leap further and higher, the forest floor falling away until I am gliding through the mid-air mist. The trees beneath me begin to shimmer and stretch, their branches turning into translucent veins of silver light. 

The heart of the storm breaks directly over me. But there is no water. Instead, the sky opens up into a kaleidoscope of stars, even though it’s midday. I reach out to catch a bolt of lightning, and as it touches my hand, it feels like a warm, buzzing secret. 

The wind whispers my name in a dozen different voices, and just as the pressure becomes too much to bear, the forest vanishes. I am standing on the surface of a perfectly still, black lake that mirrors the constellations above. The storm is gone. Everything is silent again, and the only sound is the soft *clink* of a grandfather clock ticking somewhere beneath the water. 

I look down at my hands, and they are made of the same starlight as the sky. I realize I’m not waiting for the storm to pass; I am the one who brought it here. I close my eyes, exhale a cloud of gold dust, and feel myself starting to drift upward, lighter than a thought, toward the moon.
