In another world beneath the city skyline, I find myself standing at a crossroads: the intersection of A and B isn't a physical line, yet it seems a vital place for my next move. What if I simply knew which direction to choose? But before making that choice, I have no concept of where exactly the meeting is - perhaps it's just a few minutes into the future in another part of the city altogether. For now, I'm lost and need help finding a way out of this labyrinthine world.
