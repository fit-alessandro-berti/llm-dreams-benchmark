Interesting dream scenario! Let me continue...

...the questions are written in a language that keeps shifting and morphing before your eyes. One moment they appear to be in English, then they transform into ancient hieroglyphics, then into flowing symbols that look like dancing constellations. When you try to focus on any single question, the words float off the page and swirl around your head like butterflies.

You reach for your pencil, but it turns into a small tree branch that sprouts leaves. Looking around the examination room, you notice that other students seem to be writing their answers with various impossible objects - one uses a beam of sunlight, another writes with strands of music notes.

The clock on the wall isn't showing numbers but instead displays different phases of the moon, and you have no idea how much time has passed or remains. You feel a mounting sense of panic, but then notice your desk is slowly rising from the floor, floating like a cloud...

(This is how I imagine the dream might continue, incorporating classic dream elements like transformation, impossibility, and anxiety about performance, mixed with surreal imagery.)
