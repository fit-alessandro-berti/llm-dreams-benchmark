...an ominous wind begins to whip through the trees, causing them to sway and creak. Dark clouds gather overhead, casting an eerie twilight upon the once tranquil forest. The air is thick with anticipation as the first drops of rain begin to fall, slowly at first, then faster, until it is pouring down in sheets. Lightning illuminates the sky, followed by booming thunder that shakes the earth beneath your feet. You take shelter under the dense canopy of a massive oak tree, but the storm is relentless. The rain transforms into large, fluffy snowflakes, blanketing the ground in a layer of white. The storm rages on, and you drift off into a deep slumber, dreaming of a calm and sunny day.
