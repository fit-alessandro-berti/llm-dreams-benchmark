 ...and you reach for your keyboard, but your fingers sink into warm taffy that smells like deadlines. The boss is still watching—now from the ceiling, somehow—checking a watch that ticks backwards, its hands spinning wildly like compass needles searching for north in a storm.

"The Henderson account," they say, voice layered like three people speaking at once, "needs to be translated into origami by Thursday."

But Thursday was yesterday. Or perhaps it hasn't happened yet. Time in the office has become a Möbius strip, and I can see yesterday's version of myself still sitting in the adjacent cubicle, weeping into a phone that is melting into chocolate.

I open my laptop to begin, but the screen displays only an infinite regression of smaller offices, each containing a tinier version of me, also panicking, also typing. My fingers move across keys that have become teeth—molars and incisors that chatter with every keystroke, spelling out words I don't understand in a language that tastes like burnt toast.

The walls begin to breathe. Inhale: the cubicle expands to the size of a cathedral. Exhale: it crushes inward until my elbows touch both walls. The project folder on my desk grows branches, blooming with paper that rustles like bird wings. Each document is blank except for a single red eye that blinks accusingly.

"I need an extension," I try to say, but the sentence turns into moths that flutter toward the fluorescent lights, which are not lights at all but suspended pools of liquid mercury, dripping upward.

That's when I notice the door has become my grandmother's pantry from 1994. The impossible deadline is just the oven timer ringing—a sound I've been hearing my whole life. I stand up, leaving my anxiety like a shed jacket on the chair, and step through. The project remains unfinished on the raft of my desk, which is now floating down a river of static, shrinking as it drifts away.

I wake up when the coffee machine in the dream hisses my name.
