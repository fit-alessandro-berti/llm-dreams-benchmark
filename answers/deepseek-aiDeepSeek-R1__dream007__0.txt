In the midst of the argument, the air thick with tension, you both freeze as your friend’s words suddenly begin to *melt*. Literally. Their sentences drip from their lips like honey, pooling on the floor between you, glowing faintly. Confused, you look down and realize the puddle reflects not your faces, but memories—shared laughs, late-night talks, the time they held you as you cried. 

Your friend points at the shimmering pool, their anger dissolving into awe. “I… forgot about that,” they murmur. You kneel together, sifting through the liquid moments, each droplet a fragment of your bond. The disagreement shrinks, no longer a monolith but a pebble beside the mountain of what you’ve built. When you stand, the room is a meadow, sunlit and quiet. Without a word, you both begin weaving the honeyed words into a bridge over the pool, hands sticky but purposeful. 

You wake just as they turn to you, smiling. The unresolved argument lingers, but so does the certainty: some truths are felt, not fought for.
