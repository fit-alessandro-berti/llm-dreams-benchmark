feel a wave of relief wash over you. The strangers, a diverse group of people with warm smiles, gather around you, their voices blending into a comforting hum. One of them, an older woman with gentle eyes, steps forward and places a reassuring hand on your shoulder. "Don't worry, dear," she says, "we know this city like the back of our hands. Where are you trying to go?"

You hesitate for a moment, unsure of your destination, but then a vague memory surfaces—a place that feels like home, though you can't quite picture it. You describe it to them as best you can: a quiet street with a small house, a garden full of colorful flowers, and the sound of laughter echoing nearby. The group listens intently, nodding as if they understand exactly what you mean.

A young man with a bright scarf steps forward, pointing down a winding alleyway. "I think I know the place. Follow us!" he says with infectious enthusiasm. Trusting their kindness, you join them as they lead you through the maze of the city. The towering buildings and noisy streets seem to fade into the background as you walk, replaced by a strange, dreamlike calm. The group chats and laughs among themselves, occasionally turning to check on you, making sure you're still with them.

As you walk, the city begins to transform. The concrete sidewalks soften into cobblestone paths, and the skyscrapers shrink into quaint, ivy-covered cottages. The air fills with the scent of blooming flowers, and you realize you're getting closer to that elusive place. The group stops at the edge of a familiar street, and there it is—the small house with the vibrant garden, just as you remembered. Children's laughter spills out from behind the house, and a sense of belonging fills your chest.

The older woman turns to you with a knowing smile. "This is your place, isn't it?" she asks. You nod, tears of gratitude welling in your eyes. The group begins to step back, their figures slowly fading into the golden light of the setting sun. "Take care," the young man with the scarf calls out, his voice echoing softly as they disappear.

You stand there for a moment, watching the last of their silhouettes vanish, then turn toward the house. As you push open the gate and step into the garden, the dream shifts again. The laughter grows louder, and familiar faces—loved ones you haven't seen in ages—emerge from the house to greet you. You're no longer lost; you've found your way home.

And just as you embrace them, the dream begins to blur at the edges, the colors melting into a soft, warm haze. You feel yourself drifting, the city and the house slipping away, but the feeling of being found lingers as you slowly wake.
