in your attempts to ask for help, you find that you are unable to speak. You try to open your mouth, but no words come out. The people around you seem to be speaking a foreign language, and you can't understand what they're saying.

Feeling overwhelmed and lost, you decide to step outside for some air. Once outside, you discover a beautiful garden filled with vibrant flowers and soothing water features. The tranquility of the garden provides a stark contrast to the chaos of the party.

As you wander through the garden, you come across a group of people who are speaking your language. You approach them and strike up a conversation, quickly discovering that they share similar interests and values. You feel a sense of connection and belonging, and you decide to spend the rest of the evening with this newfound group of friends.

As the night comes to a close, you reflect on the dream and realize that it was a reminder to trust in yourself and not be afraid to step out of your comfort zone. You feel grateful for the new connections you've made and look forward to exploring new social opportunities in the future.
