... begin to feel a familiar knot tighten in your stomach. The air seems to grow heavy, thick with the weight of expectation. You look around the room, trying to make sense of it all. One moment you're catching up on emails, the next you're drowning in the sudden, overwhelming pressure.

"Right, let's do this," you mumble, forcing a degree of composure you don't feel. You turn back to your boss, plastering what you hope looks like determination onto your face.

"I just need to... prioritize a little," you say, your voice sounding slightly strangled to your own ears. "Maybe start with X? If I focus entirely, maybe it's possible..."

You feel a prickle of sweat break out on your temples. Panic is a solid, physical thing pressing against your ribs. You sit down at your desk, mechanically opening a fresh document, but your mind is already spinning, visualization impossible. Images flicker behind your eyes – the boss's expectant gaze, the ticking clock, papers flying everywhere. You know, absolutely *know*, you can't do this, but you have to act like you can, or else the dream will shatter into even more impossible shards. You type a single, hesitant letter, feeling completely out of control yet compelled to *do* something, anything, to try and anchor yourself. The deadline looms, mocking, impossibly close.
