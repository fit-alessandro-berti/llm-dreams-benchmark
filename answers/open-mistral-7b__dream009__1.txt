find a source of food and water to survive. You notice some fruits hanging from trees and decide to pick some for your first meal. After satisfying your hunger, you set out to find a nearby stream for water. As you walk, you notice the locals working in the fields, using tools made from wood and stone.

You approach one of them and try to communicate, but they don't understand your language. You realize you need to learn their language to survive and make friends in this new era. You spend the next few days trying to learn their language by observing and mimicking their actions and words.

Eventually, you manage to communicate with the locals and they invite you to join them for a meal. You gratefully accept and discover that their food is simple but delicious. They teach you how to hunt and fish, and how to use their tools effectively.

As time passes, you adapt to the new era and even start to enjoy the simple lifestyle. You learn to appreciate the beauty of nature and the sense of community with the locals. You realize that you don't miss modern technology as much as you thought you would, and that there's a certain peace and happiness in this simpler way of life.
