The fluorescent lights hum like angry hornets as I stare at the email subject line: **"Project Chronos - Due in 37 Minutes. No Excuses."** My boss, Mr. Thorne, materializes beside my desk—*how did he get here so fast?*—his polished shoes clicking on the linoleum, his shadow stretching too long in the artificial light. "Begin," he says, his voice like gravel in a tin can. The document attached is... empty. Just a blinking cursor on a white void.  

I reach for my mouse, but my fingers sink *through* it like warm butter. The clock above the door ticks backward: **36:00... 35:59...** Panic floods my throat. *Impossible.* I type frantically—*Project report due—*but the words dissolve into smoke before hitting the screen. The office air thickens, smelling of burnt coffee and static. Desks around me flicker in and out of existence. Sarah from Accounting is suddenly sculpting origami swans from her quarterly spreadsheets; they flap paper wings and vanish.  

Thorne leans over my shoulder, his breath icy. "The deadline *is* the project, Eleanor." His tie is a live eel, writhing against his chest. I realize: **I have to rewrite time itself.** My keyboard morphs into hourglass sand. I grab a handful—it burns like dry ice—and hurl it at the screen.  

The monitor shatters into a thousand ticking clocks, each showing a different time. **27:14... 19:03... 04:59...** I sprint down the hallway, but the floor tilts like a slide. Doors race past me: *BREAK ROOM*, *ARCHIVES*, *VOID*. I kick open **VOID**—and collapse into a room with no walls, just endless shelves of unopened boxes labeled **"REGRETS."** Thorne stands atop the highest shelf, holding a pocket watch that bleeds liquid shadow.  

"**Tick-tock,**" he echoes. "They’re waiting." *Who?* I glance down: my hands are translucent. The floor is a giant clock face, seconds hand scything toward me. I dive for the nearest box—**"Promised to Call Mom"**—and tear it open. Inside: a single, dying dandelion. I blow the seeds, and they float upward, each glowing like a firefly. One lands on the seconds hand, freezing it at **00:17**.  

The room holds its breath. Thorne’s eel-tie hisses. *Seventeen seconds.* I grab the dandelion stem and *write* in the air:  
> **"Sorry. I’m trying."**  

The words hang, shimmering. The clocks stop. Thorne nods—*actually nods*—and the eel untangles into a silk necktie. "Good enough," he murmurs, handing me a cold, smooth stone. "For now."  

I wake up gasping, my heart hammering the rhythm of a stopped clock. My actual desk is cluttered with real papers. My real boss texts: *"How's Project Chronos?"* I stare at the stone in my palm—warm, veined with gold—before it dissolves into coffee grounds. On my screen, the blank document now reads:  

> **"Begin."**  

*(The dream lingers—the smell of dandelion fluff, the weight of the stone. You realize: the impossible deadline wasn’t for work. It was for learning how to breathe.)*  

You take a slow breath. And start typing.
