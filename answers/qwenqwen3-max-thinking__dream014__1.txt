...step hesitantly toward them, the city’s cacophony—honking horns, distant sirens, the murmur of a thousand conversations—fading to a hush as if the world itself leaned in to listen. Their faces are soft with empathy, eyes holding no judgment, only warmth. One extends a hand, palm open, not demanding, just offering.

You take it.

The moment your fingers brush theirs, the pavement beneath your feet dissolves into something softer—cool grass, damp with dew. The steel and glass towers warp and melt like candle wax, reforming into ancient, whispering trees whose leaves shimmer with impossible colors: indigo, silver, the soft green of new hope. The strangers aren’t strangers anymore. You recognize them—not by name or face, but by a deeper knowing. They are fragments of yourself you’d forgotten: your courage, your curiosity, the quiet voice that hums lullabies when the world feels too sharp.

"We’ve been waiting," one says, their voice like wind through reeds. "You were never lost. Just… remembering how to trust the path."

Ahead, a path winds through the trees, paved not with stone but with glowing, interlaced roots. It pulses faintly, like a slow heartbeat. You realize *you* are the path. Every wrong turn, every moment of doubt, every alley where you felt invisible—it all led here, to this clearing where you finally see your own light reflected in their eyes.

You let go of their hand, not because you don’t need them, but because you understand: they walk beside you now, not ahead. Together, you step onto the living road. The city’s noise is gone. In its place, a single, clear note hangs in the air—a song you’ve always known, humming from your bones.  

And for the first time in forever, you’re not lost.  
You’re coming home.
