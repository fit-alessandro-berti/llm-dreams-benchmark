...and symbols etched into its surface, swirling like ancient runes that seem to shift and dance under your gaze. The patterns aren't just decorative; they're alive, pulsing with a faint, ethereal glow that draws you in deeper. As you trace one with your finger, a warm vibration courses through your hand, unlocking a flood of forgotten memories.

Suddenly, the box begins to hum, and the room around you morphs. You're no longer in your familiar bedroom; instead, you're standing in a vast, misty forest where trees whisper secrets and the air shimmers with iridescent colors. The box floats just above your palms, its lock dissolving into thin air. Inside, you find not gold or jewels, but a mirror that reflects not your face, but a version of yourself from a life you never lived—confident, fearless, and free.

As you reach for the reflection, the dream world tilts. The forest fades, and you're soaring through the stars, the box now a compass guiding you toward distant galaxies. But just as you grasp the edge of infinity, a gentle pull yanks you back. You awaken with a start, the box vanished, leaving only the faint echo of those intricate patterns etched in your mind. What did it all mean? Perhaps it's a sign to unlock the mysteries within yourself.
