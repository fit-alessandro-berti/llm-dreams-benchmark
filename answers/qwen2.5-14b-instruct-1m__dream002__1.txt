the wind picks up, sending leaves swirling around your feet like miniature tornadoes. The sky darkens to an ominous shade of purple, and lightning cracks in the distance, illuminating the towering trees for fleeting moments. You hear the distant rumble of thunder, but it's not just any storm—it feels ancient, as if the very earth itself is awakening.

As you continue to walk, the air grows colder, and you notice strange symbols etched into the bark of the trees. They seem to glow faintly, pulsing with a blue light that matches the color of the storm clouds above. The ground beneath your feet begins to shift, and you realize the forest floor is alive, moving like the surface of a vast, hidden ocean. Roots twist and intertwine, forming pathways that seem to lead deeper into the heart of the woods.

Suddenly, a figure appears at the edge of your vision—a tall, hooded figure standing motionless under the canopy. Their presence feels both familiar and unsettling, as if you’ve known them in another life. They don’t move, but their eyes, glowing with an ethereal light, follow your every step. You hesitate, unsure whether to approach or flee.

The storm intensifies, and rain begins to fall, but instead of water, it’s a fine mist of silver droplets that cling to your skin, leaving a cool, tingling sensation. The air smells of damp earth and something sweeter, like honey mixed with the scent of forgotten memories. You can hear whispers now—soft, melodic voices that seem to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. They speak in a language you don’t understand, but somehow, you feel like you always have.

You take a step forward, and the figure raises a hand, palm open, as if offering guidance. Without thinking, you follow, walking deeper into the heart of the storm. The trees grow taller, their branches twisting together to form a tunnel of living wood. As you pass through, the world outside fades, replaced by a clearing bathed in soft, golden light. In the center stands an ancient tree, its roots reaching deep into the earth, and its branches stretching toward the heavens. A pool of shimmering water sits at its base, reflecting the stars that now fill the sky.

You approach the pool, and as you lean down to look into its depths, you see yourself—only not as you are now, but as you were long ago, standing in this very place. The figure steps beside you, and together, you watch the reflection change, showing scenes from your past, present, and future. It’s as though the storm has brought you here to confront something you’ve been running from all along.

But before you can fully grasp what it means, the figure turns to you and speaks, their voice like the rustle of leaves in the wind. "You are not lost," they say. "The storm is a guide, leading you back to where you belong."

And with those words, the storm begins to calm, the silver rain ceasing, and the whispers fading into silence. You wake up, but the feeling lingers, a sense of purpose and clarity that you carry with you even after the dream ends.
