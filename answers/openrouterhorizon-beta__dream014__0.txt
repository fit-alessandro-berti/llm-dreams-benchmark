…hesitate, unsure if you can trust them, but their eyes are bright with a warmth that feels like a distant memory. They form a small circle around you, a moving constellation against the blur of neon signs and hurried footsteps, and you let yourself be guided.

You pass through streets that seem to bend and soften as you walk, buildings folding like paper into gentler shapes. One of them hands you a map that isn’t made of paper at all, but of light—thread-thin lines joining places by feelings instead of names: “Where you laughed,” “Where you were brave,” “Where you almost turned back.” You realize you’ve been here before, not in this city, but in the way it hums with possibility.

They ask you simple questions in soft voices: What color does comfort feel like? Which direction smells like rain? You answer without thinking—blue, and left—and they nod as if you’ve just recalled something important. The sidewalks become tiled with old songs you used to know. A florist waves, handing you a single stem that blooms differently in each reflection you pass.

You cross a bridge that seems to span two moments rather than two shores. Below, the water holds the sky like a promise. One of the strangers, a woman with silver thread braided into her hair, tells you that getting lost is just the road’s way of trying to meet you. You want to believe her. You do.

They lead you to a quiet square hidden behind a curtain of ivy where the city breathes slower. There’s a bench worn smooth by listening, and a fountain that whispers your name only when you’re not trying to hear it. The kind strangers stop and stand a little apart, as if this is the place where your own footsteps need to speak. The map of light flickers in your hands, then settles into the shape of a key.

You look down and find a door set into the ground, a door you hadn’t noticed because it looks so much like the space between thoughts. The key fits. When you open it, you feel air rising from below—cool, familiar, like the first night you ever recognized the moon as someone you knew.

“Will you be okay from here?” one of them asks, not with worry but with faith. You realize that their faces are softened mirrors of people you once trusted: a teacher, a stranger who held an elevator, the friend who waited while you searched for the right word. You thank them, and the word thank you opens a little more light.

You descend a few steps and find not a tunnel, but a garden made of crossroads—paths branching in gentle spirals, each lined with something that belongs to you: a ribbon of laughter, a coat left behind and returned, the book you never finished, the note you wrote in the margin: find yourself here. The air tastes like cinnamon and a summer you didn’t think you’d get back.

You choose a path by the sound of your own quiet. It leads to another city, or perhaps the same city, but this time you know where the sun sits at noon and how the streetlights blink awake like old friends. You look over your shoulder to wave, but the kind strangers are already dissolving into the crowd, their absence a gentle hand on your back.

It’s only then you realize that their kindness wasn’t a direction but a language, and you can speak it now. As you walk, the buildings keep time with your breath. You pass your reflection in a shop window and it smiles first. And when the dream starts to blur at the edges like watercolor, you are no longer lost. You are being met, again and again, by the road that has been waiting for your feet.
