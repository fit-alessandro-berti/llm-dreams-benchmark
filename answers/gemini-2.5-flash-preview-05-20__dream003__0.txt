You are dreaming. You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and what seem to be constellations, swirling faintly, as if painted with starlight.

My fingers trace the cool, smooth surface, following the lines. As my fingertip brushes a cluster of particularly bright 'stars,' a low hum begins, vibrating through the box and into my palm. The hum deepens, and the starlight patterns begin to shift, not just swirling but *rearranging* themselves, forming new, impossible constellations. The metal itself seems to soften, becoming less solid, more like liquid night.

The box doesn't open in a conventional sense; instead, the surface ripples, becoming translucent. Through the shimmering facade, I can glimpse something within. It's not a treasure or an object, but a *place*. A miniature, swirling galaxy, not unlike the patterns on the box itself, but vast and deep. Tiny nebulae bloom and fade, distant suns ignite and collapse in impossible speed.

A strange pull emanates from within, a silent, irresistible current that draws me closer. My reflection distorts in the swirling light on the box's surface, my face merging with the cosmic dance. I feel less like an observer and more like a participant, as if the box is a window not just *to* a universe, but *into* a part of myself, a forgotten memory etched in starlight.

The hum grows louder, filling my ears, until it's the only sound, the only sensation. The edges of my vision blur, and the room around me fades, replaced entirely by the infinite, silent roar of creation unfolding within the box, within me.
