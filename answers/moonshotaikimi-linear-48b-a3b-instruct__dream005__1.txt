…as you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and each conversation starts out normal—someone asks where the bathroom is, another offers you a drink—until suddenly their voices start to echo and their faces ripple like water. You realize they’re all wearing the same mask: your own.

You reach for the edge of the mask, panicking, but your hand passes straight through it. The room tilts. The music skews into a low, animal growl. The one familiar face is nowhere in sight, and the crowd—hundreds of strangers wearing your face—begins to turn toward you in perfect unison.

Then you notice the doors. They weren’t there before. Glowing faintly, recesses in the wall that open into impossible corridors of light. You run. Behind you, the sound of footsteps—hundreds of them—starts to follow. Not sprinting, just walking, like a funeral procession.

You don’t stop until you find yourself back at the center of the room, the masks gone. Everyone is staring at you with concern. The one person you know is gone.

The lights flicker. The dream rewinds—just a second—and the weight of déjà vu clamps down on your chest.
