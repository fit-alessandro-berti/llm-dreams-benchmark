encounter a grand, ancient door covered in intricate carvings. The door is locked, and above it, a riddle is inscribed in glowing letters:

*"I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?"*

You ponder the riddle, recalling similar puzzles from your past. The answer—*an echo*—clicks into place. As you whisper the word aloud, the door creaks open, revealing a vast chamber bathed in soft, ethereal light.

Inside, the maze transforms. The walls shift like liquid, forming new paths and puzzles, each more challenging than the last. A voice echoes around you: *"To proceed, you must solve the unsolvable."*

Before you stands a mirror, but instead of your reflection, it shows a version of yourself from a different life—one where you made different choices. The mirror-other gestures for you to step through, but you hesitate. Is this a test of logic or of self-awareness?

As you reach out, the dream begins to fade, leaving you with a lingering question: *Was the maze ever real, or was it all a reflection of your own mind?*

Would you like to explore another layer of the dream, or wake up now?
