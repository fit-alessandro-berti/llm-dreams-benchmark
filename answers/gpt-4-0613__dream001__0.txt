panic, your heart pounding, the buildings looming around you impossibly tall and made of what appears to be swirling molten metal and shimmering crystal. You reach into your pocket, hoping to find your phone and use its GPS, but it’s not there. 

The city is bustling, filled with ethereal people who rush by you, their faces blurred and indistinct. No one stops, even when you reach out, trying to catch someone's attention. You feel a twinge of desperation, the unease growing stronger.
