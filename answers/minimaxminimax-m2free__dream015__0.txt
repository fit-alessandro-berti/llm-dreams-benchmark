You find yourself in a post‑apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. The sky is a mottled gray‑green, streaked by the ash of a long‑dead sun, and the wind carries a faint, metallic hum that seems to whisper the names of those you’ve lost. Broken towers lean like arthritic giants against a horizon of endless dunes of rust and glass. Each step you take kicks up clouds of dust that cling to your skin, and every shadow could hide a raider, a feral mutt, or something far worse—something that feeds on fear itself.

Despite the hardships, you decide to do something that feels both absurd and urgent: you will climb the cracked spire of the old city’s abandoned communications tower, not because you hope to see anything beyond the wasteland, but because the rusted metal still holds a single, flickering beacon of light. In the pocket of your ragged coat, you clutch a battered solar panel you salvaged from a collapsed station—its cracked surface still able to catch enough weak sunlight to power a small, homemade flash. 

Your breath comes in ragged puffs as you grip the corroded railing, the wind tugging at the tattered remnants of your shirt. You half‑expect the tower to crumble under your weight, but it holds—just barely. As you reach the narrow platform at the top, you spread the solar panel over the rusted panels, aligning it to catch the dying sun. The faint glow of the beacon stutters to life, casting a thin, trembling circle of light that cuts through the perpetual dusk.

In that moment, the world seems to pause. The distant howl of a mutated beast fades to a muffled whine, the hissing of distant acid vents softens, and the only sound that remains is the steady thrum of the beacon—a promise that someone, somewhere, might still be listening. You close your eyes, feeling the pulse of the machine match the rhythm of your own heartbeat, and you whisper into the empty air: “We’re still here.”

Then, a sudden, sharp crack splits the silence. The tower quivers, the metal groans, and a fissure snakes up its side. You feel a pull of gravity as the tower begins its slow, inexorable descent. In the chaos, you hear a faint echo—voices, faint and distant, coming through the static of the beacon, crying out in a language you barely understand but somehow recognize: the sound of hope.

Your last thought before the world tilts and falls is not of fear, but of the small circle of light you managed to ignite. Even if the tower crumbles, even if the wasteland swallows you whole, the beacon will keep pulsing, a beacon for any wandering soul who ever needs a sign that they are not alone. And as the ground rushes up to meet you, you feel a strange, soothing sensation, as though you are falling not into darkness, but into a sea of possibilities—a dream that never truly ends.
