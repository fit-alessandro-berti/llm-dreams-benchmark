…speak, but what comes out is not your prepared speech.

Instead, a small, delighted sound escapes you—like the first note of a tune you haven’t learned yet. The microphone hums, catching it, stretching it, and the room tilts.

Words melt into color.

You feel no fear, only a strange, buoyant clarity as your mouth keeps moving. What falls into the air are not sentences, but images that everyone can see:

- A door, half-open, floating above their heads.
- A key on a string of light in your hand.
- A quiet field at dusk, where all their abandoned ideas sit up and look around, blinking.

You try again to speak normally.

This time, your voice arrives as a gentle wind that moves through the audience. As it passes, you watch their shoulders drop, their jaws unclench. Phones disappear without anyone putting them away. A woman in the back row suddenly remembers what she wanted to be at age seven. A man in the front row recalls the last time he forgave himself without bargaining.

You look down at your notes; they are blank.

You flip the pages—blank, blank, blank—with a growing, surreal calm. The blankness isn’t failure; it’s invitation. The room brightens, not from the stage lights, but from somewhere behind the walls, like the building itself is waking up to listen.

You laugh once, softly, into the mic.

“There’s been a mistake,” you say, and for the first time it comes out as clear language. The sound rings close to your ears and impossibly far away, like you’re talking from the bottom of a well and the top of a mountain at the same time.

Everyone leans in.

“The speech I was going to give,” you continue, “you’ve all already heard. Every version of it. Better ones. Worse ones. It’s worn out. It’s hanging in the air like old wallpaper.”

As you speak, the wallpaper peels from the walls in slow curls: slogans, bullet points, promises, diagrams. They drift down like shed skins and dissolve before touching the floor.

“I think we’re supposed to try something else.”

The crowd doesn’t murmur. They listen the way people listen to a storm about to make up its mind.

You become aware that you can feel each person as a tiny, warm point in the dark—three rows up, twelve seats in, a pulse of dread; balcony left, a sharp, bright question; center aisle, the particular ache of someone pretending not to be heartbroken.

You don’t know how you know, but you do.

“Close your eyes,” you say, and they do. The trust is immediate, unreasonable.

The ceiling lifts away like a lid. Above, instead of sky, there is water: deep, slow, luminous, folding over itself. You see your reflection there, and every version of you who almost didn’t come onstage, who almost walked away.

“Think of the thing,” you tell them, “that you don’t say because you’re sure no one else would understand.”

Their faces shift. Jaws tighten. Brows crease. A thousand private storms.

Your next words are not chosen; they arrive.

“Now listen…”

One by one, the unspoken thoughts rise out of them as faint, translucent shapes—worries, desires, griefs—lifting gently to hover in the air. No sound, just a soft rustling, like pages turning in a distant library.

You see:
- A childhood bedroom, perfectly preserved.
- A resignation letter never sent.
- A hand that wasn’t held at a hospital bed.
- A blank canvas that’s waited five years.
- A locked folder of songs.
- A question about whether this is all there is.

They hang between you and the crowd, a constellation of everything no one thought could be shared.

“Look,” you say.

Everyone’s eyes open.

Gasps. Not of horror, but recognition.

Because each floating secret matches with others—threading, merging. The things they thought were singular align and overlap until they form only a few large shapes: one for love, one for loss, one for fear, one for hunger for meaning, one for quiet, stubborn hope.

You step away from the podium. No notes, no script.

“This is my speech,” you say. “You have never been alone in the heaviest thing you carry. Not once. Not for a second.”

Your voice doesn’t boom; it settles around them like a blanket warmed by someone else’s shoulders. Some people begin to cry, silently and without shame. Others almost laugh with relief. One person in the second row presses their hand over their mouth as if they’ve heard a secret they’ve waited a decade to recognize as theirs.

The big shapes of shared feeling start to slowly lower, dissolving into a gentle rain of light that sinks back into their bodies, but lighter now, like the weight has been re-distributed among many hands instead of one.

The building exhales.

The microphone fades into a stem of wildflowers in your hand; no one seems surprised. Behind you, the curtain ripples and parts, revealing not backstage, but a long, open road lined with doors. Some are familiar. Some shimmer with futures you’ve never considered.

The audience is no longer seated; they are standing on the stage with you without having moved, as if the space folded. There is no separation between where they sit and where you stand.

You realize: the dream has turned the whole idea of “audience” inside out.

“I was afraid,” you admit, the last of your scripted honesty, “that I wouldn’t know what to say.”

You glance at their faces—tender, awake, a little astonished.

“But it looks like,” you finish, “I don’t have to say it alone.”

You hold out the microphone—now only a simple, ordinary object again—and someone in the front row takes it.

They open their mouth to speak, and as they do, you wake up with the clear, lingering sense that if you had stayed asleep one heartbeat longer, you would have heard exactly what you most needed to hear.
