…the air thickens with an electric hum. The leaves around you stop rustling, as if the whole forest is holding its breath. A low rumble rolls across the sky, and for a moment the world feels suspended—balanced on a single trembling note.

Then the first drop of rain lands on your cheek. It’s warm, almost comforting. But the next is cooler. And the next. Within seconds, the gentle patter becomes a sudden downpour.

You look for shelter, but the trees themselves begin to change. Their trunks grow taller, stretching impossibly toward the sky, while their roots shift beneath your feet like slowly waking serpents. The path you were following is swallowed by moss that seems to bloom in real time, curling upward in spirals of deep green.

A bolt of lightning cracks—but instead of white, it’s a vivid lavender, branching through the sky like veins of glowing crystal. It illuminates a shape in the distance: an archway of twisted branches, perfectly symmetrical, pulsing faintly with light from within.

You feel an inexplicable pull toward it.

As you approach, the storm doesn’t grow harsher; instead, it becomes strangely melodic. Thunder rolls in patterns that almost resemble a heartbeat. Raindrops strike the leaves with the rhythm of distant drums. The wind whispers your name—soft, coaxing.

When you reach the archway, the storm pauses entirely. Not stops—pauses, as though waiting for your decision.

Beyond the archway is a landscape you can’t quite focus on, shifting like the surface of water. Colors shimmer, rearranging themselves into new shapes each time you blink.

You sense that if you step through, you’ll discover the reason the storm came for you.

Do you enter?
