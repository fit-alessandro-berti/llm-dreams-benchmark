Let me continue this dream scenario...

...each group seems to be engaged in increasingly surreal activities. One circle of people is floating a few inches off the ground, having a tea party with cups that keep changing colors. As I move past them, I find another group who are speaking backwards, their words floating in the air as glowing text that dissolves like sugar in water.

I notice that the walls of the venue begin to ripple like liquid, and doorways appear and disappear randomly. The person I'm looking for seems to always be just around the corner, and I catch glimpses of their shadow on the undulating walls.

As I continue searching, I realize that everyone at the party is wearing masks that periodically switch between different faces - some human, some animal, some completely abstract. The more I try to focus on any particular face, the more it shifts and changes.

The music playing in the background sounds like it's being performed by an orchestra of wind chimes and raindrops, creating a melodic but otherworldly atmosphere...

Would you like me to continue with where this dream leads?
