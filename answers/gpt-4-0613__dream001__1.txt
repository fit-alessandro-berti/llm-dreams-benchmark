panic, your heart pounding in your chest. You look around and it appears everything is made of shifting walls of pulsating lights. Familiar shapes and patterns fade in and out of existence as you try to make sense of your surroundings.

You see towering skyscrapers covered in neon glyphs you don’t recognize. They pulse rhythmically, casting eerie multi-color shadows on the street below. The sky is a swirling vortex of purples, blues, and greens shifting and moving as though they are alive themselves. You feel as if the city isn't just a location, but a living, breathing entity.

Looking down, you realize your coat has turned into a garment made of pure shimmering light, matching the strange yet awe-inspiring surroundings. Puzzled but intrigued, you decide to look for someone, anyone, who could guide you to your meeting. Suddenly, a map materializes in your hand, its location markers fluctuating in tune with the city lights.

Your walk turns into a surreal journey, crossing a river of liquid light, then a park where the plants were made of radiant wisps, your footsteps leaving trails of bright sparks behind. All the while, you sense an undercurrent of urgency, reminding you of your pending meeting. Yet you feel your anxiety being replaced by awe and curiosity while exploring the magic of this luminescent city.

Then, as if answering your desperate plea, a creature with a humanoid figure but made entirely of the same energetic light approaches you. They speak in a flowing, musical tone yet you understand them perfectly. They introduce themselves as a native citizen and a conductor of the city's melody.

You explain your predicament and they guide you, their form shifting with the colorful beats of the city. You traverse more impossible streets until you finally reach your destination. It's a grand, iridescent building pulsating in rhythm with your heartbeat. The being gestures you towards the entrance and disappears as quickly as they appeared.

Walking into the building, you realize you are no longer in a city, but in another dimension altogether. Just as you are about to proceed, you feel a gentle shake on your shoulder. You open your eyes to find your alarm clock ringing by your side. Have you missed the meeting after all? You can't help but hope for another trip to the city of light the next time you close your eyes.
