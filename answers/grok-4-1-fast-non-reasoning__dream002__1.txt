You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the sky darkens to an unnatural bruised purple. Thunder rumbles like the growl of some ancient beast awakening beneath the earth, and the first fat raindrops splatter on the leaves, heavy as coins.

You quicken your pace, branches whipping at your face, but the path twists ahead into a misty clearing you've never seen before. Lightning cracks the sky, illuminating a massive, gnarled oak tree at the center—its roots pulsing faintly, like veins under bark. As the wind howls, the tree splits open with a deafening groan, revealing a glowing doorway framed in twisting vines.

Curiosity pulls you forward despite the gale. You step through, and the storm vanishes. You're in a sunlit glade where the air hums with fireflies, even in daylight. Ethereal figures—half-human, half-deer—dance around a crystal pool, beckoning you to drink. The water tastes like forgotten memories: your childhood laughter, a lost love's whisper, the thrill of a leap you never took.

One figure approaches, eyes like polished emeralds. "You've crossed the veil," it says, voice like rustling leaves. "What dream do you chase here?" You feel weightless, choices branching like the forest paths behind you. Do you stay and unravel their secrets, or turn back before the storm seals the door forever?

...And then you wake, heart pounding, the echo of rain still tapping on your windowpane.
