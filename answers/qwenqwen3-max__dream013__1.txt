find the puzzles shifting—not just in difficulty, but in nature. The walls, once carved from cold stone etched with riddles in languages you’ve never seen, now pulse with a soft, bioluminescent glow. The air hums with something between music and thought, and the logic you’ve relied on begins to fray at the edges.

You solve a puzzle involving floating geometric shapes that rearrange themselves based on your emotional state—frustration makes them chaotic, calm aligns them into a bridge. As you cross it, the floor dissolves into starlight beneath your feet, and for a moment, you’re walking on constellations.

Deeper still, the maze stops being a place of barriers and becomes a mirror. The next "puzzle" isn’t a lock or a code—it’s a version of yourself, sitting cross-legged in the center of a circular chamber. They look up and say, “You’ve been solving the wrong problem.”

You pause. All this time, you assumed the goal was to escape. But what if the maze isn’t something to conquer—but to understand? The walls ripple like water, and you realize every turn you’ve taken, every choice, every failed attempt has shaped the very path you’re on.

You sit beside your other self. Together, you watch the labyrinth breathe. The puzzles don’t vanish—they transform. Symbols bloom into stories. Equations unfurl into melodies. And somewhere, far ahead, a door appears—not at the end of a corridor, but in the center of your chest.

You reach for it. Not with your hands, but with your attention. And just as your fingers graze the handle—

—you wake up.  

The morning light filters through your window, and on your nightstand, a single origami crane—folded from paper you don’t remember owning—sits perfectly centered, wings slightly open, as if still dreaming of flight.
