Well, in the dream, you stand up from the couch, the tension radiating between you both like a physical force field. Memories of shared laughter feel distant now. You look at your friend, taking a deep breath that sounds loud in the sudden silence you've created.

"Well...'ll you do?" they ask, their voice thick with unshed emotion, their eyes searching yours. The argument, the harsh words, the fear you both feel – it all hangs suspended in the air.

Taking one last look at their face, communicating more than words ever could at this moment, you make your choice. You choose **resolution**.

"It's good you made me stop," you say, your voice steady but softer now, "Because I don't want us to lose *us* over this. We fought *hard* to be friends. But maybe... we need to figure out *how* to fight better."

A flicker of something – relief? cautious hope? – passes over their face. They tentatively lean back too, their posture slightly less rigid. The immediate heat of the argument has cooled, replaced by the quiet intensity of a shared crisis.

"And maybe," you continue, your gaze locking onto theirs, serious and sincere, "we figure out what this disagreement is *really* about underneath all the noise. Today. Before tonight is really over."

You don't know if it will be an easy fix, or if the next hours will bring more argument or understanding (the dream fades as you say this), but the crucial step is taken. You've chosen **understanding over winning**, **connection over being right**, and the daunting task of revisiting the disagreement with a new purpose: **not just to argue, but to truly see and be seen by the person you care about**. This is the beginning of trying to work *through* the conflict together.
