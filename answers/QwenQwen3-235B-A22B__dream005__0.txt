**You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and…**  

…realize each cluster is frozen mid-conversation, their mouths moving silently like fish. You weave through them, their eyes tracking you but never acknowledging your presence. A child’s laughter rings out, high and brittle, and you turn to see a group of towering figures in moth-eaten animal masks, their paws clutching teacups filled with liquid starlight. They chant riddles in unison, their voices echoing down a hallway that wasn’t there moments ago.  

You follow the hallway, which bends like a question mark, and stumble into a courtyard where everyone is dancing in reverse. A woman with a clock for a face curtseys to you. “*The one you seek is always here*,” she says, her hands spinning backward. “*But here is never now*.”  

A scent of burnt honey leads you to a room where shadows peel off the walls and coil around your ankles like cats. They hiss warnings: *“They’ve forgotten your name. They’ve rewritten the rules. They’ve left without you.”* You run, but the floor undulates like a tongue, and every door you open spills into another version of this night—same party, different faces, each more familiar yet unrecognizable.  

Finally, you find *them*: your person, sitting alone at a piano that plays itself. Their back is turned, their shoulders trembling with a song they won’t sing. When you touch their shoulder, they dissolve into a flock of origami cranes, each wing stamped with a word you can’t read.  

You wake up clutching a single feather, its edge sharp as a confession.
