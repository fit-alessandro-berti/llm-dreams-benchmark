... **decide to take a step back, literally.**

The air crackled with unspoken words, sharp and stinging like static electricity.  Your friend's face, usually warm and familiar, was etched with frustration, mirroring your own.  The topic, you couldn't quite grasp the specifics anymore, had become a swirling vortex of emotions, pulling you both down.

Suddenly, a strange calmness descends, a whisper of dream logic cutting through the heat.  You feel a pull, not physical exactly, but more like a shift in focus.  Without a conscious thought, your feet move, and you *step back*.

Not just a metaphorical step back, no. In this dream, it's literal.  As you move backwards, the intensity of the argument seems to lessen with each stride. The sharpness of your friend's voice softens, the furrow in their brow begins to smooth.  The cramped, cluttered room you were in seems to expand, the walls receding into a hazy, less defined space.

With each step you take away, the argument becomes like a play unfolding on a distant stage.  You can still see the gestures, hear the muffled tones, but the emotional weight, the immediate pressure, begins to dissipate.  It's like turning down the volume on a blaring radio.

From this new distance, you can observe.  You see your friend's posture, the slight tremor in their hands. You notice the way their eyes dart around the room, searching for something, perhaps understanding, perhaps just a way out of this impasse.

And in this strange, dreamlike detachment, a new feeling emerges.  It's not agreement, not necessarily even understanding yet.  It's something softer, more fundamental.  It's the quiet recognition of the bond you share, the history you have together.  The argument, from this distance, seems almost… smaller.  Less monumental.

You continue to step back, further and further, until the heated exchange is just a murmur in the background.  The room has dissolved into a soft, grey mist, and your friend is now a figure in the distance, still animated, but less threatening, more… vulnerable.

And in this space, in this quiet, dreamlike distance, you finally hear your own thoughts again, unclouded by the heat of the moment.  And you realize, with a sudden clarity, that you need to...  **(continue the dream from here, deciding what you realize and what you do next).**
