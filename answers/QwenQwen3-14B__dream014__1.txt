You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you—  

—trail them through labyrinthine streets where buildings hum with forgotten songs. Their leader, a woman with eyes like fractured mirrors, hands you a compass that points not north, but *toward the sound of your own heartbeat*. As you walk, the city shifts: neon signs bloom into constellations, alleyways stretch into tunnels of liquid light, and the strangers’ laughter echoes in reverse, as if time is unraveling.  

One of them, a boy with feathers for hair, whispers, *“You’re not lost—you’re just dreaming of a place that exists between breaths.”* You glance down and see your shadow morphing into a flock of birds, then dissolving into smoke. The strangers vanish, leaving only a single key behind—a brass thing etched with the words *“Open what you’ve closed.”*  

You wake up in your bed, the city gone, but the key still warm in your palm. Outside, the sky is a bruised purple, and somewhere, a door you’ve never noticed before creaks open in the distance.
