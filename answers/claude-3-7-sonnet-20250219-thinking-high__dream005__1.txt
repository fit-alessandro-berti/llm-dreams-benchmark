# The Search

You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and notice something strange: everyone's face seems slightly blurred, like a photograph out of focus. You move through the crowd, which parts and reforms around you like water.

A group near the window is laughing at a joke you didn't hear. When you approach, they all turn to you simultaneously, their laughter continuing but now soundless. One offers you a drink in a glass that keeps changing color.

In another corner, businesspeople are exchanging business cards that transform into butterflies when passed from hand to hand. They nod at you knowingly, as if you're late for an appointment you don't remember making.

The hallway stretches impossibly long when you enter it. Doors line both sides, and you're certain your friend is behind one of them. Each door you open reveals the same party, but with subtle differences – different lighting, different music, different versions of the same people.

You hear your name called from somewhere behind you, but when you turn, the voice seems to come from ahead instead. The walls begin to breathe slightly, expanding and contracting like lungs.

Finally, you spot your friend across the room, but when they wave, their arm leaves trailing copies of itself in the air. As you move toward them, the floor becomes soft and elastic. By the time you reach them, you realize it's not your friend after all, but a mirror reflecting a version of yourself you don't quite recognize.

\You found me,\'ve been waiting.\
