You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to… feel a strange lightness in your feet. Not nervousness, not fear, but a genuine buoyancy. It’s like the stage is made of clouds. 

I open my mouth to speak, but instead of words, a cascade of butterflies erupts. Not *from* my mouth, exactly, but *around* me. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of iridescent butterflies, each a different shade of blue and purple, swirling and dancing in the spotlight. 

The audience doesn’t gasp, doesn’t murmur. They *laugh*. A warm, joyful sound that washes over me. It’s not a mocking laugh, but a delighted one, as if this was exactly what they were hoping for.

And then, I understand. I wasn’t supposed to *tell* them anything. I was supposed to *show* them. 

I begin to move, not with practiced gestures, but with a fluid, instinctive grace. The butterflies respond, mirroring my movements, forming shapes in the air – a soaring bird, a blooming flower, a swirling galaxy. I’m not controlling them, I’m *with* them, a conductor of a silent, shimmering symphony.

As I dance, images flash behind me on a massive screen – not pictures I chose, but memories. Not *my* memories, but fragments of everyone in the audience’s lives. A child’s first steps, a shared sunset, a moment of quiet understanding. Each image is accompanied by a specific butterfly, a unique shade representing the emotion of that memory.

I realize the speech wasn’t about *me* at all. It was about *them*. About connecting them to the beauty and fragility of their own lives, reminding them of the moments that truly mattered.

The dance slows, the butterflies begin to settle, landing gently on shoulders, in outstretched hands. A profound sense of peace descends. 

Then, a single voice, clear and strong, rises from the crowd. It’s not a question, not a comment, but a simple, heartfelt… “Thank you.”

And as I look out at the faces, illuminated by the soft glow of the remaining butterflies, I know, with absolute certainty, that I’ve said everything I needed to say.



And then… a tiny, purple butterfly lands on my nose, and I wake up giggling.
