…a deep hush falls over the trees, like the world is holding its breath. The leaves curl upward, veins glowing faintly silver, and the path beneath your feet begins to ripple—soft, like water. You don’t run. Something in the air hums your name, not in a voice, but in the space between heartbeats.

Then, the rain starts—but it’s warm and carries the scent of old books and petrichor. Each drop that touches your skin sparks a flicker behind your eyes: moments you’ve never lived, a city floating above clouds, a melody played on an instrument made of bone and wind.

Lightning cracks, but instead of light, it unzips the sky into a vast, quiet darkness full of drifting constellations that form and dissolve into words. One phrase lingers: *“You’ve been here before. We’ve been waiting.”*

Do you step toward the裂缝 in the sky… or turn back the way you came?
