# Lost and Found

You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you accept their offer with grateful relief. They form a circle around you, their faces kind but slightly luminous in a way you can't quite explain.

The tallest one points to a narrow alleyway you hadn't noticed before, bathed in golden light despite the gray day. As you follow them through it, the city sounds fade and the buildings begin to shift subtly - growing taller, then shorter, their architecture blending centuries and styles impossible in the waking world.

One of the strangers hands you a small, warm stone that seems to pulse with an inner light. \d your way back,\ stone feels familiar in your palm, as though you've held it many times before.

You emerge into a vibrant plaza where everyone seems to know you, calling your name and waving. The strangers are still beside you, but somehow they're also old friends, and as the dream logic unfolds, you realize you were never truly lost - just temporarily disconnected from a place where you've always belonged.

The city, once overwhelming, now embraces you like home.
