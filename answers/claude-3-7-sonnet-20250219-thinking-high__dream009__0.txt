# Lost in Time

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to adapt quickly to survive in what appears to be medieval times.

The first thing that hits you is the smell—a pungent mixture of smoke, livestock, and unwashed bodies. You're lying on a straw mattress in a small timber-framed house. Sunlight filters through a single window covered with oiled parchment instead of glass.

Outside, you discover a village bustling with activity. Women in long dresses and head coverings carry water from a central well. Men work with hand tools in fields or workshops. Children chase chickens between buildings. No electricity lines, no cars, no smartphones—just the sounds of manual labor, animals, and human voices.

Your modern clothes immediately mark you as an outsider. Several villagers stare, whispering to each other. You need to blend in, find food, and figure out how to communicate with these people whose language sounds vaguely familiar but archaic.

A kindly older woman notices your confusion and gestures for you to follow her. Perhaps understanding begins with accepting help—the first step in navigating this new world where your knowledge of technology is useless, but your human capacity to learn and connect remains your greatest tool.
