You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and **a brush that seems to be made of liquid starlight.**

The moment your fingers graze the handle, the chaotic swirls of the background slow to a gentle hum, as if the world itself is holding its breath. You realize this isn't just any canvas; it doesn't reflect what you see, but rather what you *feel*.

 Hesitantly, you dip the brush into the air near a floating, crimson spiral. Instead of red paint, the brush pulls out a strand of warm, buzzing laughter. When you touch it to the white surface, the canvas ripples like water, and suddenly, a door materializes in the painting. It creaks open, revealing not a room, but a memory you thought you had forgotten—a sunny afternoon from your childhood, rendered in perfect,静止 (still) detail amidst the shifting chaos.

As you step closer to the painted door, the landscape around you begins to mimic the stability of the memory. The erratic shapes solidify into familiar trees and solid ground. You realize the dream is offering you a choice: step through the canvas into the stillness of the past, or turn back to the vibrant, unpredictable flux of the present, taking the starlight brush with you to paint your own path forward.

The air smells of ozone and old books. Which way do you turn?
