**Dream Continuation:**  

You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **grab a fistful of the nearest object—a cracked mirror—and hurl it at the ground between you**. Shards scatter like frozen rain, but instead of clinking against the floor, they *sing*, each shard emitting a note that harmonizes into a haunting melody. The room around you begins to dissolve, the walls peeling into strips of parchment covered in scribbled memories: birthdays, secrets, the first time you met.  

Your friend’s face shifts, morphing into a mask of shifting shadows and light, their voice now an echo of your own. *“You can’t outrun this,”* the mask says, even as you turn to flee. The door behind you warps into a gaping mouth, teeth made of clock hands ticking backward. You sprint down a hallway that stretches and contracts like a lung, your breath syncing with the rhythm of a heartbeat pounding in your ears.  

Suddenly, you’re outside—a storm rages, but the rain falls upward, drenching the moon. Your friend materializes beside you, now holding the mirror shards, their edges glowing. *“Look,”* they whisper. In the reflection, you see not yourselves, but a child you’ve never met, weeping at the base of a tree that grows thorns where leaves should be. The thorns pierce the child’s palms, and you realize, with a jolt, that the tree is rooted in your own chest.  

You wake up clutching your blanket, the taste of salt on your lips. Somewhere deep inside, a door you didn’t know was closed begins to creak open.

*Dreams often speak in riddles, turning conflict into metaphor. What part of yourself might you be arguing with? And what’s growing in the garden of your hidden heart?*
