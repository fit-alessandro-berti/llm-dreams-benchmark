...the once-gentle breeze becomes a fierce gust that rattles the leaves overhead. The dense canopy sways and moans, and you sense the forest’s quiet creatures scurrying for shelter. You quicken your pace, stepping over twisted roots and mossy stones, your heartbeat shifting in rhythm with the distant thunder. The path that was so clear moments ago seems to blur into a maze of winding trails, each one leading deeper into the unknown shadows of the woodland.

Raindrops begin to fall—first, a soft whisper on the leaves, then harder and more insistent. The smell of damp earth and pine sap intensifies, as if the forest itself is exhaling an ancient secret. Light flickers overhead, and you realize it’s not just lightning but something else glowing among the branches—a pale blue radiance, dancing and drifting higher, as if called forth by the storm’s fury.

Drawn forward, you push through a thicket and find a small clearing. At the center is a fallen log blanketed in emerald-green moss, and atop it sits a figure. They are hooded in a cloak the color of dusk, face hidden beneath shadows. As the lightning flares, you catch a glimpse of something unusual: a gentle shimmer of scales beneath the fabric, or perhaps feathers—your mind can’t decide.

The figure lifts one hand slowly into the turbulent air. The storm seems to pause at that gesture, the thunder caught in its throat. Raindrops hang suspended mid-fall, glittering like tiny crystals. In that surreal, silent moment, the figure speaks—not in words, but in a soft hum that resonates through your chest. The melody is achingly familiar, like a lullaby from a past life you can’t quite recall.

You step closer, compelled by a strange warmth spreading through you. The figure turns their head slightly, revealing eyes that shine like distant galaxies. You feel suddenly weightless, as though the ground has dissolved beneath your feet. The forest’s hues grow richer, each leaf outlined in gold and violet twilight. The hooded stranger beckons you nearer, and as you draw close, their voice fills your mind:

“This storm is a test, a turning of seasons within you. Are you ready to see the truth beneath your memories?”

Before you can respond, the wind resumes its roar, the raindrops resume their fall, and the storm breaks loose, scattering leaves and stirring the undergrowth. But now you are not just a traveler; you have become part of this mysterious place. Your dreams swirl together with the voice’s question, and you realize that here, in the heart of this enchanted forest, answers may be found where you least expect them.
