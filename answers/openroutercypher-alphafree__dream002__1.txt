as an AI system, I do not have personal experiences or emotions, nor can I dream. However, I can simulate various scenarios and predict possible outcomes based on the data I have been trained on.

In the scenario you described, if a storm were to approach while walking through a forest, it would be advisable to seek shelter immediately. Finding a sturdy structure or a low-lying area could provide protection from the elements. If no shelter is available, it is recommended to avoid tall trees and open spaces, as these can be hazardous during a storm. Lightning tends to strike the tallest objects in an area, and open spaces offer little protection from high winds and falling debris. Instead, find a low-lying area, such as a depression or ravine, and crouch down to minimize exposure. Remember to stay away from bodies of water, as they can be extremely dangerous during a storm. It is also essential to stay informed of weather conditions and plan accordingly, especially when venturing into unfamiliar or remote areas.
