…look down at the tools and documents you’ve been handed. You notice something strange: the papers are written in a language you’ve never seen before, and the tools are oddly shaped, as if they were crafted for some alien species. You can’t tell which end of the pen-like device is meant to write, and the computer in front of you is not responding to any key you press. You look up at your boss—their face keeps shifting, features melting and reappearing as if you were trying to remember their appearance but failing. Still, they are impatient. Their blurred lips are moving, but the words reach your ears late and jumbled, as if traveling through thick water.

Your heart is pounding. The deadline is not just impossible; it seems to be breathing down your neck. There’s a giant digital clock on the far wall that counts down in seconds, but the numbers keep sliding off their slots and rearranging themselves. You want to start, but you don’t know where. Then your phone buzzes. It’s a message you somehow understand, even though it’s just a series of strange symbols. Its meaning is clear to you: *Deliver the project before the countdown hits zero or everything falls apart.*

You try to speak, to explain your confusion, but your voice is muffled, as if you’re wearing a thick scarf. No one acknowledges your struggle. Your coworkers drift by in silence, their eyes hollow, as if they’ve given up trying to communicate. Each of them carries stacks of shimmering folders or oddly shaped calculators, and none look worried. You want to ask them for help, but the moment you open your mouth, the sound of distant thunder fills the office. The lights flicker, the walls swell as if breathing, and now there’s a faint smell of ink and wet leaves.

Your boss hovers beside you, eyes narrowed. They tap the desk, a reminder that time is almost up. You tap the keys again—this time, the screen shows a map of tangled vines, luminous fruits, and drifting constellations. The project you’re supposed to complete isn’t a spreadsheet or a presentation. It’s something impossible, like weaving together strands of light and shadow to form a bridge. The desk drawer glows, and when you open it, you find a pair of gloves that feel heavy with meaning. You slip them on and suddenly understand: you must sculpt the solution out of the thick, invisible air around you.

You push your hands into the empty space above the desk, and there’s resistance, as if the air were clay. You shape it carefully. Your boss watches silently. The countdown on the wall sputters, almost at zero. You’re trying to form something that can hold all that nonsense data, all those alien instructions. You craft a shape—an impossible geometric form that hovers in midair. It feels both solid and not. You step back, and as you do, the boss nods slowly, their features momentarily clarifying into a faint smile. The countdown hits zero, but instead of an alarm, you hear a distant melody, soft and reassuring.

The walls stop breathing. Your coworkers pause, turn, and smile. The deadline is met, the impossible accomplished. You try to take a breath of relief, but as you inhale, you realize the air is filled with glittering particles that swirl into your lungs, making you feel lighter. Your boss says something kind now, though you can’t remember the language. The clock on the wall drips into a puddle on the floor. The project you created hovers quietly, shedding calm blue light.

You feel yourself drifting upward, as if released from gravity. The office floors and desks blur into a tapestry of colors. You look at your hands—the gloves have vanished, and in their place is a soft glow. You close your eyes, and when you open them again, you are fully awake, back in your own bed. The sense of relief and quiet accomplishment remains, though you can hardly explain what it is you’ve just done.
