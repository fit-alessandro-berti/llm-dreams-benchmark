…you raise your voice over the wind, but it doesn’t come out as sound—it comes out as a bell tone, deep and clear, and the waves hesitate as if they’re listening.

The sky is the color of bruised metal. Rain lashes the deck in slanted ropes. Your first mate’s mouth moves, but the words are stolen by thunder. All you can read is the question in their eyes: *What now?*

You reach for the wheel and your fingers close around something warm. Not wood—bone, smooth and humming. The compass in its brass cradle spins, then slows, then points not north but *down*, its needle dipping toward the churning black water like it wants to pierce it.

“Hold her steady,” you try to say again. This time the ship answers for you. The hull groans a sentence through the planks. You understand it the way you understand your own name.

*Below.*

A wave rears up like a wall, higher than your mast, its face briefly lit from within as if lightning has drowned and is still flickering. The crew cries out. Someone crosses themselves. Someone laughs, sharp with panic. The ship pitches and you feel your stomach float, your thoughts scattering like gulls.

And then the sea opens.

Not splits—not breaks. It *unzips*, a neat dark seam widening from the bow. Water draws back as if pulled by a hand beneath the surface, revealing a long corridor of air and dripping rock, like the throat of a cave that leads under the ocean. The storm continues above, but it suddenly feels far away, like you’ve stepped inside a house while someone rages outside.

Your ship glides forward without sails. The wind can’t find you here. The waves can’t reach you. The lanterns along the rail flare blue, one by one, without being lit. Their flames burn sideways, leaning toward the passage as if something is breathing in.

The crew gathers close, soaked and silent. Their faces look wrong in the lantern-light—too pale, too intent, like paintings watching you.

The compass needle points straight down. It taps the glass in a patient, accusing rhythm.

You follow.

The passage curves, descending. Water drips from the ceiling in slow, deliberate drops that land on the deck and don’t splash; they settle like tiny pearls and roll toward your feet. You kneel without deciding to and pick one up. It’s cold. In its surface you see not your reflection, but the ship from above—tiny on a furious sea, a toy being shaken.

A whisper threads through the corridor. It is not in your ears. It is under your tongue, behind your teeth.

*Captain.*

You stand. Your hand is still on the wheel. The wheel is turning by itself, gently, as if guided by someone patient.

Ahead, the passage opens into a vast chamber. The air tastes of old salt and pennies. The sea is overhead now, a ceiling of moving darkness, held in place like glass. Schools of fish drift above you, slow as thoughts. Every so often a bolt of lightning crawls across the underside of the ocean, illuminating it from beneath.

In the center of the chamber rises a structure like a lighthouse made of coral and rusted anchors. It doesn’t emit light. It *absorbs* it. Around it float countless objects—bottles, broken oars, a child’s shoe, a crown, a door knocker, a violin—each turning slowly as if on invisible strings.

Your ship eases closer, drawn like a needle to a magnet.

At the base of the coral lighthouse is an archway. Beyond it: a calm, impossible harbor. The water there is smooth as oil. No storm. No wind. The surface reflects not the ceiling-ocean above, but a night sky full of stars that you swear you’ve seen somewhere else—maybe in a book you read as a child, maybe in the moment before you were born.

A figure stands on the dock.

They are dressed like an old navigator—cloak heavy with spray, hat brim low. When they lift their face, you expect it to be a stranger’s. It is not.

It is you.

Not you as you are, but you as you might have been: eyes clearer, posture straighter, the kind of calm that comes from having already survived.

They raise a hand, and the storm’s sound dims further, as if someone has pressed a pillow against the world.

“You brought them,” your other-self says, voice carrying without effort.

Your throat tightens. “Where are we?”

“A lee shore,” they say, and smile without humor. “A place captains find when they’ve run out of weather.”

Behind you, the crew shifts. You can feel their hope like warmth at your back. They want to believe this is refuge. You want to believe it too.

The other you walks closer, boots silent on the wet boards. Their eyes flick to the compass, still pointing down, still insistent.

“You can anchor,” they say softly. “If you anchor, the sea above will forget you. The storm will pass and you’ll never have to answer it again. No more waking to waves. No more choosing. You can stay here, where everything is still.”

The air of the harbor is tempting—thick with peace, heavy with the promise of no decisions.

But then you hear it.

Not thunder. Not wind.

A small, steady knocking—*tap… tap… tap*—coming from below your feet, from inside the ship, from somewhere that isn’t a place.

Like someone trapped in a wall, patiently asking to be let out.

Your other-self’s expression changes. For the first time, something like fear crosses their face.

“You hear that too,” they say.

You look down at the deck. The wood has begun to swell, the grain rising into tiny ridges like braille. Without thinking, you run your hand along it.

Under your palm, the ship spells a message.

*WAKE.*

A wave of dizziness sweeps over you. The lantern flames tremble, turning from blue back to ordinary yellow. The harbor’s stillness seems suddenly thin, like painted scenery. The coral lighthouse pulses, slow and hungry.

Your crew looks at you the way they did on the open sea—waiting.

Your other-self steps closer, urgently now. “If you leave, you’ll go back to the storm. You’ll feel every decision. Every loss. Every—”

The tapping beneath your feet becomes a pounding. The compass needle rattles against its glass. The ceiling-ocean above ripples, and a huge shadow passes over it, vast enough to darken the chamber.

Something is swimming up there.

Something that knows the way out.

Your other-self reaches for your wrist. Their hand is cold as the pearl-drop. “Stay. Let the sea forget you.”

You look past them, to the harbor water reflecting those impossible stars. For a heartbeat you can almost step off the ship, almost hand your weight and your worry to that stillness.

Then you look back at your crew: their wet hair stuck to their foreheads, their hands white-knuckled around ropes, their eyes full of trust and terror and the simple fact that they are *with you*.

The ship beneath you knocks again, a final insistence.

*WAKE. WAKE. WAKE.*

You straighten, and your voice returns as voice—raw, loud, human.

“Cast off,” you command.

Your other-self’s face fractures with something like grief. “You don’t know what you’re choosing.”

“I do,” you say, and surprise yourself with the certainty. “I’m choosing them. I’m choosing the storm. I’m choosing to steer.”

You wrench the wheel. The ship shudders, then responds like a living thing relieved to move. The bow swings away from the dock. The harbor’s air grows colder, resisting you like syrup.

The coral lighthouse hums. The floating objects begin to spin faster, orbiting as if caught in a whirlpool that hasn’t formed yet.

Your other-self steps back, swallowed by dimness. Their voice follows you, softer now, almost kind.

“Then remember,” they say. “Remember, when you wake, that you have been here. Remember that stillness is a place you can choose—but it will always ask a price.”

The passage behind you yawns open like a throat. Your ship surges into it. The ceiling-ocean above breaks into churning motion, and you feel the storm’s roar returning, rushing to fill your ears.

The lanterns flicker out one by one.

Darkness.

The pounding beneath your feet becomes your own heartbeat, loud in your ribs.

The compass needle stops tapping. It points not down, not anywhere at all—it spins freely, released.

You breathe in—

—and your mouth fills with the taste of salt.

You open your eyes.

You are in your bed, in a room that is too quiet after thunder. Your sheets cling to you like sails after rain. Your heart is racing. Somewhere outside, a car passes with a sound like distant surf.

On your nightstand, your phone screen glows with the time.

And beside it, inexplicably, is a single cold pearl of seawater, perfectly round, refusing to evaporate.

When you touch it, you hear, very faintly, the creak of timbers and the patient voice of the ship:

*Captain.*
