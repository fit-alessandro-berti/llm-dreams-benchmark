Ah, a dream of temporal displacement—how thrilling! Let’s weave this into a vivid, immersive escape. Here’s how your dream might unfold, with rich sensory details and choices to deepen the experience:

### **The Awakening**
You jolt awake to the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, your body stiff from unfamiliar bedding. The air is thick with the hum of cicadas and the distant clatter of hooves. Sunlight filters through a thatched roof, casting golden patterns on the rough-hewn walls of a **19th-century farmhouse**—or perhaps a **medieval stone cottage**, or even a **pre-Columbian adobe hut**, depending on the era you’ve landed in. Your clothes feel strange: a simple linen shift (if female) or a rough wool tunic (if male), no pockets, no zippers. Your hands are calloused from work, not typing.

A **wooden spoon** clatters to the floor beside a clay pot of porridge. The door creaks open. A **gaunt, kind-eyed woman** (or a **brooding blacksmith**, or a **young peasant boy**) steps in, eyes widening at the sight of you. *"By the saints… you’re not from here."* She hesitates, then gestures to a **rusted dagger** on the wall. *"The lord’s men come asking about strangers. You’ll need this."*

### **The First Need: Survival**
You realize you’re **completely unprepared**. What do you do?

1. **Food**: The pantry holds **dried beans, smoked meat, and a moldy loaf of bread**. The woman offers you a **hunk of hard cheese**—but you’re starving. Do you:
   - **Steal a chicken from the coop** (risking the farmer’s wrath)?
   - **Ask for a trade** (what do you have to offer? A skill? A story?).
   - **Forage in the woods** (but you don’t know which berries are safe).

2. **Shelter**: The house is drafty. The woman mentions a **cellar** beneath the floorboards—rumored to be haunted. Do you:
   - **Sleep upstairs** (but the bed is infested with fleas).
   - **Sleep in the cellar** (and wake to find a **strange symbol carved into the wall**).
   - **Sleep outside** under the stars (but wolves howl in the distance).

3. **Protection**: The dagger is blunt. You notice:
   - A **blacksmith’s forge** in the village—you could forge a proper blade, but it’ll take days.
   - A **hidden compartment** in the house holding a **silver coin** (worth a fortune) and a **tattered map**.
   - A **child** in the village who whispers, *"The old ones say the river runs with gold… but the bridge is cursed."*

4. **Identity**: The woman calls you *"Sir"* or *"Mistress"*—but you don’t remember your name. A **scrap of paper** in your pocket has a **faint symbol** (a clock? a key?) and a date: **2024**. Do you:
   - **Ask the village elder** about the symbol (they might call you mad).
   - **Hide it** and focus on blending in.
   - **Try to "remember"** by meditating by the river (and see **fragments of your modern life**—a phone ringing, a news headline).

### **The Era’s Quirks**
Depending on where you are, the world reacts differently:
- **Medieval Europe**: You’re a **serf** until you prove your worth. The church burns "witches" (are you one?).
- **Wild West (1880s)**: You’re a **homesteader** or a **desperado**. The railroad is coming—will you ride it or fight it?
- **Prehistoric**: You’re a **hunter-gatherer** with no language. The tribe sees you as a **spirit** or a **monster**.
- **Victorian England**: You’re a **lost heir** or a **scandalous woman** in a corset. The **telephone** is a myth.

---
### **The Twist**
As you adapt, you notice:
- **A recurring dream** of a **door in the woods** that wasn’t there before.
- **Animals acting strangely**—birds flying in patterns, a **fox that speaks in riddles**.
- **Your shadow moving on its own** when you’re not looking.
- A **stranger** who recognizes you from *"the future"* (but they’re lying).

### **Your Choice**
What’s the **first thing you do** to survive—and does it lead you deeper into the mystery, or closer to escape?
