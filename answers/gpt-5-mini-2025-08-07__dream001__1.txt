…run.

Your shoes slap wet pavement as avenues fold and refold like pages. Skyscrapers lean in to whisper addresses that rearrange themselves; a tram hums past that reads the time in tiny blinking lights — 38 minutes. You yank your phone from your pocket; the screen is a smear of ink that resolves into a map you don’t remember downloading. Every name on the map is a memory you almost have: childhood pet, a teacher’s laugh, the scent of rain on hot asphalt. You follow a thin, pulsing line that promises the meeting’s location.

People stream beside you — some in suits, some in costumes from eras you can’t place — and one woman turns, smiles, and hands you a ticket stamped with the single word: Decision. You look up and alleyways have opened like answers; a stairwell sprouts from the center of the street and climbs into a sky that trembles between dusk and dawn. The city seems to tally your choices: each corner you pass whispers what you might lose and what you might gain.

By the time you reach the plaza the line has shortened to fifteen minutes. The meeting place is nothing like you expected: a circle of folding tables under a canopy of paper lanterns, each lantern containing tiny moving scenes — a child learning to ride a bike, a houseboat on a glass river, an empty office desk. At the head of the circle sits a person whose face is familiar and not — a composite of every mentor, critic, and friend you’ve ever had. They look at you without judging and say, simply, “You’re right on time.”

You sit. Someone pours tea that tastes like a decision you once postponed. The agenda is loose; there are no PowerPoints, only questions that feel like keys. “What did you come to change?” the wordless face asks. Outside, the city exhales; inside, the clock in your hand has stopped at the exact minute you arrived. For the first time in this dream, you can choose whether to answer — or to stand, leave the table, and follow another pulsing line into whatever the city will become next.

Alternate quick endings:
- Practical: You finally ask a barista, who points to the third-floor gallery painted with a mural of the same map. The meeting is exactly where the mural points — a serious room, a handshake, a contract. You leave with a pen you don’t remember signing.
- Whimsical: The meeting turns out to be a tea party hosted by a cat in a waistcoat. It offers you a biscuit labeled “Opportunity” and purrs encouragement until you decide which door in the room actually opens.
