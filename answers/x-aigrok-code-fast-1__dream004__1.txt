As you approach the blank canvas, its surface begins to ripple like liquid mercury, shifting from stark white to a vortex of swirling hues you've never seen—even in dreams. Without thinking, you dip an imaginary brush into the air and start painting. Shapes erupt from nothingness: a crescent moon that howls, mountains that crumble into confetti stars, and rivers of liquid laughter that carry whispers of forgotten cities.

But as your masterpiece grows, so does a strange awareness creeping in. The canvas isn't just blank; it's mirroring you. Your strokes reveal hidden truths—faces of people you've lost, branching paths of decisions unmade. Suddenly, the colors solidify into a door. You push it open, stumbling into a kaleidoscope hall of mirrors where every reflection morphs into alternate versions of yourself: one who's a astronaut surfing cosmic waves, another a dragon hoarding stories instead of gold.

In the distance, a faint echo calls: "Wake up... or dream on?" The choice is yours, dreamer—what do you draw next?
