as you touch it, colors begin to swirl and leap from your fingertips, painting vivid scenes from your past and future. The more you interact, the more the canvas comes alive, reshaping itself into portals leading to different moments in time.

One doorway reveals a city floating on clouds, where people wear garments that shimmer like liquid light. Another leads to an endless, spiraling library filled with books that whisper their stories into the air. You step forward, drawn toward a glowing golden door that hums with an unfamiliar yet soothing melody.

As you push it open, you find yourself standing in front of a mirror—but it doesn’t reflect your current appearance. Instead, it shows a version of you with luminous eyes, wearing a crown of stars, as if you are a ruler of this dream realm. The reflection smiles knowingly and reaches out a hand.

Do you take it?
