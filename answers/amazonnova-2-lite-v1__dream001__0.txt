### **You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to…**

---

You take a deep breath, trying to calm the rising panic in your chest. The city around you is strange—buildings twist into impossible angles, streets shift when you blink, and the air hums with a low, electric whisper. You check your watch: **58 minutes**.  

You **start to** **run**, but not blindly. You stop at a nearby kiosk, its screen flickering with glowing symbols you don’t recognize. A woman with eyes like polished obsidian hands you a worn map, her voice a whisper on the wind:  

> “The meeting isn’t where you think it is. It’s where *you* are meant to be.”

The map unfolds in your hands, and the inkSeems to writhe, forming paths that disappear as you trace them. You notice a pattern—symbols that match tattoos on your own wrists, ones you don’t remember getting. You press one, and the map glows, pointing you toward a towering, spiraling structure that wasn’t there a moment ago.

You sprint through winding alleys, past street vendors selling glowing fruit and clockwork birds. The streets seem to rearrange themselves, closing behind you like a living maze. You pass a mirrored bridge where your reflection smiles at you and mouths:  

> “You’re late.”

You ignore it and press on.  

Suddenly, a door appears in the wall ahead—plain, wooden, unassuming. Above it, a digital timer counts down: **00:09… 00:08…** You reach it just as the numbers hit zero. The door creaks open on its own.

Inside is not a room—but a **circular chamber** lit by soft, pulsing light. At its center stands a figure in a suit made of shadow, their face hidden behind a mask shaped like a question mark. A table floats in the air before them, set with a single chair.  

As you sit, the figure speaks, its voice echoing as if from everywhere and nowhere:  

> “You made it. Most don’t.”

The meeting wasn’t about business. It was about *you*—your choices, your fears, your forgotten memories. The city was a test, a dream within a dream. And now, the real conversation begins…
