The stage lights blur into a soft, golden haze as you take a deep breath, the weight of the moment pressing against your chest like a warm, familiar hand. The audience isn’t just a sea of faces anymore—they’re shifting, morphing into something else. Some of them have the faces of people you’ve lost, their eyes glinting with quiet encouragement. Others are strangers, but their expressions are so vivid, so *alive*, that you can almost hear their unspoken questions humming in the air between you.

You open your mouth to speak, but the words don’t come out as planned. Instead of your prepared speech, a melody spills forth—a song you don’t recognize, yet somehow know every note of. The crowd leans in, their bodies swaying slightly, as if the music is pulling them forward. The stage beneath your feet begins to dissolve into a vast, open field, the grass glowing faintly under a sky streaked with colors you’ve never seen before. The microphone in your hand turns into a branch, heavy with fruit that pulses with light.

A voice—yours, but not yours—whispers in your ear: *"Tell them the truth you’ve been carrying."*

You look down and realize you’re not wearing the clothes you thought you were. Instead, you’re draped in something woven from shadows and starlight, shifting with every movement. The audience is no longer just people; they’re reflections of you—versions of yourself at different ages, different moments of joy and sorrow, all waiting to hear what you’ll say next.

And then, just as suddenly as it began, the dream tilts. The stage reforms beneath you, the crowd solidifies back into strangers, and the microphone is just a microphone again. But the weight of the moment lingers. You clear your throat and begin, not with the speech you rehearsed, but with the words that have been burning inside you all along:

*"I used to think dreams were just echoes of the day. But what if they’re the other way around? What if the day is just a shadow of the dream?"*

The audience exhales as one, a collective breath that ripples through the room like wind through leaves. And then—

You wake up.

(Or do you?)
