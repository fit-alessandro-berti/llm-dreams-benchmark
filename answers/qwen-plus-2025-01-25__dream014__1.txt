feel a wave of relief wash over you. Their warmth and genuine concern seem like a lifeline in the chaos around you. They ask where you're trying to go, but when you try to answer, your words come out jumbled, as if your destination is just beyond reach, floating somewhere in the fog of your mind.

One of the strangers hands you a small, intricately carved wooden compass. It doesn’t point north—it spins wildly, then settles on an unfamiliar direction. "Follow this," they say with a knowing smile. You hesitate for a moment, unsure why you should trust such an odd tool, but something about their confidence puts you at ease.

As you begin walking, the city transforms around you. The towering skyscrapers blur into vibrant murals depicting scenes of forests, oceans, and starry skies. Streetlights morph into glowing lanterns carried by shadowy figures who nod encouragingly as you pass. The noise of traffic fades, replaced by the sound of distant laughter and the rustling of leaves.

The group follows behind you, occasionally pointing out hidden paths or offering quiet encouragement. One stranger carries a bundle of feathers, another a sack filled with what looks like stardust. Each time doubt creeps into your mind, one of them offers a wordless gesture that reassures you.

Eventually, the compass leads you to a clearing in what now appears to be a dense forest. In the center stands a tree unlike any you've ever seen—its trunk gleams silver, its leaves shimmer gold, and its roots stretch deep into the earth, pulsing faintly with light. At its base lies a mirror-like pool reflecting not your face, but images of places you’ve longed for, people you’ve missed, and moments yet to come.

"You’ve found your way," says one of the strangers softly. "This tree holds all paths—past, present, and future. Look closely, and you’ll see the answers you seek."

You kneel by the pool, gazing into its depths. The visions swirl together, forming a single image: yourself standing confidently, surrounded by loved ones, in a place that feels both familiar and new. A sense of peace settles over you, and you realize that being lost wasn't about finding a specific location—it was about discovering the strength within yourself to keep moving forward.

When you look up, the strangers are gone, leaving only the compass resting against the tree's root. As you pick it up, the city reappears around you, bustling once more, but now it feels less overwhelming. With the compass in hand, you take a deep breath and step back into the flow, ready to navigate whatever comes next.
