…written in Choctaw.

At first, you panic—your professor never mentioned the language. You scan the room. Everyone else is calmly writing, their pens gliding effortlessly, smiles on their faces. You look at your own hand. It’s growing feathers. Your skin ripples like water under moonlight. The exam booklet begins to flutter, its pages turning on their own.

A voice, soft as wind through tall grass, whispers:  
*“You’ve been studying all your life. You just didn’t know the lessons were the dreams.”*

You look down again. The Choctaw script isn’t words—it’s memories. Each symbol is a moment: your grandmother humming a lullaby in her kitchen, the smell of rain on packed earth after your first hike in the Ozarks, the way you held your best friend’s hand the night they left for college, silent, brave, both of you knowing you’d never say goodbye.

You realize—you’ve already passed.

The exam isn’t testing knowledge. It’s testing recognition.

The final question reads:

> “What did you carry when no one was watching?”

You close your eyes.

And the room dissolves—not into darkness, but into dawn.

You are standing on a hillside, wearing the same jacket you wore when you were ten, holding a basket of wild strawberries you picked yourself. Behind you, rows of faces—your teachers, your parents, your younger self, the strangers you saved without knowing it—all smiling. Not because you got the answers right.  

But because you remembered how to feel.

The bell rings.

You wake up.

Your alarm says 5:47 a.m.

And somehow, you’re holding a single strawberry in your hand.

You smile.

You know exactly what to do today.
