...the wind begins to whip through the trees, turning gentle whispers into frantic howls. The sky, once a soft blue glimpsed through the canopy, deepens to a bruised purple. The air grows heavy and charged, pressing against your skin with a strange, electric hum.

A single, fat raindrop splatters on your forehead, cold and startling. Then another. Within seconds, the heavens open, releasing not just rain, but a deluge that soaks you to the bone in an instant. The peaceful path becomes a slick, muddy track. Thunder cracks directly overhead, a sound so immense it feels less like a noise and more like a physical force shaking the world.

You start to run, your heart hammering against your ribs, but the forest is now a confusing labyrinth of swaying, groaning giants. Lightning flashes, and in that stark, blue-white instant, you see a silhouette ahead—not a tree, but the outline of a small, ancient stone hut, nearly swallowed by ivy and shadow.

Driven by instinct, you throw yourself towards it. The wooden door is swollen with moisture, but it gives way with a groan. You stumble inside, into a profound silence broken only by the muffled roar of the storm outside and the frantic drumming of your own heart.

You are safe. But as your eyes adjust to the gloom, you see you are not alone. A figure is sitting by a cold, ash-filled hearth, calmly stirring a pot that hangs over no fire. It turns its head, and its eyes are like pools of still, dark water.

"Ah," it says, its voice like the rustle of dry leaves. "I've been waiting for you. The storm always brings the next one."
