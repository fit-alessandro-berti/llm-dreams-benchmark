...and you decide to **stop talking entirely.**

The sheer volume of their voice, the precise, wounding logic of their counterpoints, suddenly feels less like communication and more like a physical pressure building behind your eyes. The argument isn't dissolving the tension; it’s molding it into a permanent, sharp object lodged between your ribs.

You don't apologize or storm out. Instead, you perform an immediate, drastic redirection.

You reach out, not to grasp their sleeve, but to intercept the large, heavy dictionary resting innocently on the coffee table between you. Without a word, you slam the book open to a random page.

The world instantly goes silent.

The printed words on the page—*‘Obfuscate,’ definition: render obscure, unclear, or unintelligible*—glow with a soft, phosphorescent light. As you stare at the definition, the living room warps. The familiar walls dissolve into a liquid gray haze, and the floor beneath you becomes spongy, absorbing all sound and weight.

Your friend is still there, their mouth still moving in mid-sentence, but the metallic sharpness of their voice is gone. Their words are now just silent, meaningless shapes escaping their lips—like fish gasping for air.

You look down at your hand, which is now resting on the dictionary. The pages begin to ripple like water, and the definition of 'Obfuscate' spreads outward, overtaking the other words, washing the paper clean until it is a blinding, white surface.

You realize the only way to win—or to survive—is to entirely abandon the framework of the language that caused the hurt.

You step onto the blindingly white page. The spongy floor grips your shoes. As you walk, the white space opens up into a vast, silent, infinite landscape—a place where only feelings exist, untranslated by vocabulary.

You glance back at your friend. They are frozen, half-submerged in the gray liquid that was once the living room. They lift a hand, still trying to convey their point, but you shake your head gently. The need to be right, the need to argue, is suddenly pathetic and distant.

You turn and walk deeper into the blinding white silence, knowing that they cannot follow until they, too, decide to leave their words behind. You walk until the light becomes too bright to see, but perfectly warm, and finally, perfectly quiet. You wait there, in the overwhelming silence, until the lingering echo of the argument finally leaves your mind, evaporating like fog beneath a hot sun.
