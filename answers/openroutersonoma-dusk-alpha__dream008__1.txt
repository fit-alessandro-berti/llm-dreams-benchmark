You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel the clock ticking like a heartbeat in your chest. The office warps around you—desks stretch into infinity, papers flutter like startled birds, and your computer screen flickers with code that's alive, twisting into serpents that hiss deadlines in binary.

You dive in, fingers flying over the keyboard, but every keystroke summons more chaos: emails avalanche from nowhere, colleagues morph into clockwork figures chanting "Faster! Faster!" Your boss, now a towering shadow with glowing eyes, looms closer, his watch hands spinning wildly. Sweat beads on your forehead as the deadline shrinks to minutes, then seconds.

In a panic, you hit "compile," and the screen erupts in a burst of light. The project assembles itself—not perfectly, but gloriously chaotic, a patchwork of brilliance and bugs that somehow works. The boss nods, fading into mist, and the office dissolves into a serene meadow under a starry sky. You wake up, or do you? The dream lingers, whispering that impossible deadlines are just the mind's way of testing wings.
