...and before you can even register its presence, the canvas *breathes*.

It doesn’t just lie flat—it *pulses*, like a slow, silent heartbeat made of stretched linen. The blankness isn't empty; it’s a deep, hungry *potential*. You reach out, not with your hand, but with your *thought*—and the moment your focus touches its surface, it ripples.

Colors you’ve never seen before bloom like liquid galaxies: cobalt that hums, crimson that smells of rain, a green so alive it sprouts tiny, translucent leaves along the canvas’s edge. Shapes twist and melt—not randomly, but *responding*. A jagged line becomes a mountain range when you feel small; a soft curve unfurls into a river when you remember childhood summers.

Then, the ground beneath you softens. Your feet sink slightly, not into mud, but into *pigment*. Vermilion? Ultramarine? It swirls around your ankles, warm and electric. The landscape behind you—the shifting dunes of cerulean fog, the trees made of stained glass shards—begins to *peel* away, lifting like wet paper, and flows toward the canvas.

You realize: the canvas isn’t separate from this world. It’s *absorbing* it. And you’re part of the scene.

Panic flares—what if you’re next? But the canvas pulses again, slower this time. Calmer. It doesn’t want to erase you. It wants to *collaborate*.

So you close your eyes and think of home. Not a place, but a *feeling*: the smell of old books, the sound of a kettle whistling, the weight of a cat in your lap. When you open them, the canvas shimmers. A door appears—not painted, but *grown*—carved from light and memory, its handle made of woven shadows. It stands slightly ajar, revealing not another world, but *your* world… softened at the edges, glowing with that same impossible green.

You step toward it. The pigment at your feet flows like loyal ink, following. And as your hand touches the door, the entire dreamscape sighs—a sound like wind through a thousand paintbrushes—and folds itself neatly into the pocket of your coat, just in case you need to dream again tomorrow.
