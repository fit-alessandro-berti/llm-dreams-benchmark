brace yourself against the howling wind, raising your voice above the roar. “Steady, everyone!” you command. Lightning cracks across the sky, illuminating towering waves, but you keep your gaze fixed forward, scanning for a path through the chaos. Your heart pounds fiercely, yet you feel an unexpected surge of calm determination. You grip the wheel tighter, guiding the ship to crest the next monstrous wave. The crew follows your lead, their fear easing as they work in unison, trusting your guidance. Amidst the storm's fury, a glimmer of dawn appears on the horizon—a promise that if you hold on just a bit longer, you and your crew will emerge safely from the tempest into calmer waters.
