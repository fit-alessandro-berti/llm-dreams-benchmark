walk away mid-sentence, storming out into a vast, mirrored hallway where every reflection shows versions of yourself from different timelines—some smiling, others in tears. As you pace, the mirrors begin to crack, revealing glimpses of alternate realities where the argument ended differently. One shows reconciliation over a shared laugh; another, a lifelong rift. You touch a shard, and suddenly, you're back in the room, but your friend is gone, replaced by a voice whispering from the cracks: "Dreams reveal what hearts conceal." You wake up, heart pounding, realizing the disagreement stemmed from unspoken fears—yours about change, theirs about loss. In the morning, you call to apologize, and the friendship strengthens through the shared confession.
