You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are...

...written in a language you don’t recognize, the symbols looking like a mix of musical notation and circuit diagrams. The first page simply reads: *“Prove you are awake.”*

You look around the room. Everyone else is writing calmly, their pens scratching confidently across the page. Your own exam booklet feels warm in your hands, and the words on it seem to subtly rearrange themselves when you blink. The clock on the wall has no numbers—just a slowly rotating spiral.

The proctor walks by and pauses at your desk. Without looking at you, they whisper, “The answer is in the margin.” But when you check the margins, they’re filled with your own childhood memories, sketched in pencil: your fifth-grade classroom, a lost toy, the smell of rain on hot pavement.

You try to write something, anything, but your pen has no ink. The paper absorbs the pressure of the tip, leaving only faint indentations. A bead of sweat falls onto the page, and where it lands, the paper turns translucent. Beneath it, you see the back of the next page—already filled with perfect, elegant solutions in a handwriting you don’t recognize.

The person next to you glances over. Their eyes are clear and calm. “You’re dreaming,” they say softly. “The only failing grade is waking up too soon.”

You feel the weight of the career you’ve worked for—the title, the salary, the life you’ve imagined—pressing down on your shoulders like a physical coat. But under it, you feel something else: a lightness, as if you could float up out of this chair if you chose.

The exam questions begin to fade. The page is blank now. The proctor smiles, just once, and erases the clock from the wall.

What do you do?

*(The dream holds its breath, waiting for your next move.)*
