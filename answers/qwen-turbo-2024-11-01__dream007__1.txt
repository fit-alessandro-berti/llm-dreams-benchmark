break the tension by suggesting you both take a moment to cool off and talk it out later when you're both calmer. You suggest going for a walk or having some tea, giving each other space but also showing your willingness to understand their perspective. As you walk, the scenery around you changes from a busy city street to a serene forest path, symbolizing the inner journey towards peace and clarity. When you return, you find that the argument has dissolved into mutual understanding and appreciation for each other's viewpoints.
