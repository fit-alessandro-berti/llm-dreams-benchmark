step back and take a breather. Suddenly, you find yourself in a different place.

You’re floating above a tranquil ocean. Its vastness contrasts significantly with the tension you recently escaped, and you feel a deep sense of peace and calm. The argument that consumed your mind only seconds ago begins to assimilate into the distant fabric of this panoramic oceanic vista. 

A gentle, low-frequency hum resonates in the bone-chilling icy water beneath you. Suddenly, a massive, magnificent humpback whale breaches the surface near your dangling feet, releasing a water spout from its blowhole. The giant sea mammal glides past you in a slow-motion ballet, providing a humbling perspective of the complexities, unknowns and depth of life. 

With the whale's majestic passage slowly fading into the sea mist-veiled horizon, you realize the insignificance of your earlier disagreement. After all, what are petty squabbles in the grand scheme of life, especially when friendships hold so much more importance?

Overwhelmed by this powerful realisation, your body starts to gravitate back to the ground, and you effortlessly float back down until your toes press sensibly against the soggy soil. Suddenly, you experience an abrupt transfer to reality; you're back in your heated argument. Nevertheless, something is different. You feel a rush of tranquility and carry a newfound perspective, which gives you a clarity that would not have been possible without that unexpected whale encounter.

Seeing the calmness in your demeanor, your friend is initially startled. You suggest taking a break, reevaluating your argument, and focusing on the immense love and respect you have for each other that far outweigh any disagreement. Your friend, perhaps confused but seeing your sincerity, agrees. On this note, your dream ends, leaving you prepared to handle the argument more effectively.
