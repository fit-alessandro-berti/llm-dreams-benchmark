You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you…

---

The wind howls like a choir of angry wolves, tearing the night sky into jagged shards of lightning. Waves rise taller than the mainmast, their white‑capped crests crashing against the hull with a rhythm that threatens to drown the faint thrum of the ship’s own heartbeat. The deck beneath your boots heaves, slick with rain, and the lanterns swing wildly, casting ghostly, trembling circles of amber on the churning water.

Your crew—weather‑beaten men and women whose faces are etched with stories of distant ports, whose eyes dart like gulls in a storm—huddle around you. Their hands grip the railings, knuckles white, while the ropes bite into their palms. They look to you not just for orders, but for a steady presence, a lighthouse in the chaos.

You take a breath that seems to pull the thunder away for a heartbeat, feeling the raw, electric pulse of the ocean in your lungs. In that brief silence, a memory rises: a night on a calm bay years ago, your father’s voice—crackling like a radio—telling you, “A good captain never commands the sea; he listens to it.”

You lift your torch higher, not to pierce the darkness, but to signal that you are still here, still awake, still willing to hear. “Hold fast!” you shout, your voice cutting through the roar. “We are not the storm. We are the ship that rides it.”

You turn to the helm, fingers finding the familiar worn wood, and you set the wheel to a calm course—not directly into the wind, but at a slight angle that lets the vessel glide on the wave’s crest instead of tearing into its trough. You give each crew member a precise, simple command: “Secure the mainsail, drop the spare, tighten the bowline, and keep your eyes on the horizon.” The words are short, but they are a rhythm—a metronome for the chaos.

One of the younger sailors, eyes still wide with fear, asks, “Captain, what if we can’t make it through?”

You smile, a thin line that catches the lantern’s flicker, and you answer, “The sea never intends to drown us. It simply wants us to learn how to swim.” You pull the old, weather‑stained logbook from the table and open it to a page where, years ago, you’d scribbled a sketch of a dolphin leaping through a wave. “Remember this,” you say, tapping the drawing. “Even the fiercest waters hold moments of grace.”

As the ship tilts and lurches, you feel the wheel under your palm—a living thing, pulsing with the same rhythm as your heart. You let the ship’s hull kiss the waves rather than fight them. You adjust the trim, easing the pressure on the mainsail, and the wind, as if respecting your surrender, shifts its fury into a steady push that carries you forward.

Minutes melt into an hour, the storm’s roar dimming into a low, persistent growl. The rain softens, falling now like a veil, and the lightning no longer slices the sky but paints it with soft, silver ribbons. The crew, though still drenched, moves with a new confidence, their muscles remembering the cadence of the ship rather than the chaos of the storm.

Suddenly, through the thinning clouds, a thin crescent of moon appears, silver and patient. It reflects on the water, turning the sea into a sheet of muted glass. The waves, once monstrous, now roll like gentle breaths. The ship, guided by your steady hand, glides into this tranquil corridor, and the crew exhales a collective sigh that mingles with the wind.

You stand at the helm, eyes scanning the horizon where the darkness recedes, and you feel a quiet hum beneath your feet—a reminder that the ocean’s heart still beats, but the storm has given way to a promise of calm. You turn to your crew, their faces now illuminated by the moon’s soft glow, and you say, “We have weathered the night. As long as we stay true to the course we set together, no tempest can break us.”

A distant gull cries, and the ship’s bell, untouched for far longer than you’d liked, rings out—clear, resonant, a sound that cuts through the lingering mist. The bell’s tone carries across the water, a testament to perseverance, to the unspoken bond forged in the eye of the storm.

And as the dream begins to dissolve with the first breath of dawn, you feel the deck beneath your boots become solid once more. The storm is no more than a memory, a swirling tapestry of fear and courage, and you—captain, listener, guide—are still at the wheel, steering toward whatever horizon awaits.

The wave‑slicked night fades, but the echo of the storm’s lesson lingers: leadership is not the power to command the wind, but the wisdom to chart a course through it. 

*You open your eyes.*
