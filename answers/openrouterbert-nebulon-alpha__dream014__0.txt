**The Dream Continues…**

You hesitate for a moment—trust doesn’t come easily in this city of flickering neon and hurried footsteps—but their smiles are warm, their eyes sincere. One of them, a woman with a scarf the color of twilight, places a gentle hand on your shoulder. *"We’ve all been lost here before,"* she says. *"Let us show you the way."*

They lead you down winding alleys where the air smells of rain and something sweet, like caramelized sugar from a street vendor’s cart. The city’s noise fades into a hum, as if the buildings themselves are leaning in to listen. The strangers don’t ask where you’re going; they simply walk beside you, pointing out hidden doorways in brick walls, whispering about shortcuts through courtyards where ivy spills over iron gates.

Then, the path opens into a vast, sunlit square you’ve never seen before. At its center stands a fountain, its water shimmering with colors that shift like liquid gemstones. The strangers step back, their work done. *"This is where you choose,"* says the woman with the twilight scarf. *"Some roads lead back to the crowd. Others… well, you’ll see."*

You approach the fountain and notice something strange: the water isn’t reflecting the sky. Instead, it shows glimpses of other places—mountains, forests, a quiet beach at dawn. One image flickers more brightly than the rest: a small house with a blue door, smoke curling from its chimney. You reach out, and the water ripples, pulling you forward—

**And then you wake up.**

Your room is still dark, but the scent of rain lingers in the air. On your nightstand, a single silver key glints in the moonlight. You don’t remember putting it there.

*(Would you like to explore the key’s meaning, or dive back into the dream?)*
