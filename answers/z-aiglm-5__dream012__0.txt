The deck heaves beneath your boots. Salt spray lashes your face, and the wind screams through the rigging like something alive and furious.

"Captain!"

It's Harwick, your first mate. He's clinging to the railing, knuckles white, seawater streaming down his weathered face. Behind him, young Timmons is retching over the gunwale. The rest of the crew—eight souls in total—stand in a cluster near the mizzenmast, waiting. Their eyes are wide. Frightened. Fixed on you.

The storm came from nowhere. An hour ago, you were sailing smooth waters under a clear sky. Now the waves are mountains, crashing down on decks with the weight of collapsing buildings. Lightning fractures the darkness. Your ship, the *Marybeth*, groans in protest.

"Captain, the main sail's gonna tear!" someone shouts.

You have seconds to decide. The cargo hold is full of timber—heavy, valuable, and shifting dangerously with every roll. If it breaks loose below, it could smash through the hull and sink you.

But the men on deck need orders. The sail needs securing. And there, on the horizon— a faint, flickering light. A lighthouse? Another ship in trouble?

The wheel spins beneath your hand as another wave strikes. The *Marybeth* lists hard to starboard.

"Orders, Captain?" Harwick shouts over the roar.

The crew waits.
