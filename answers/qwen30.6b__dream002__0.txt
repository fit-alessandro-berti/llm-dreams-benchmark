As the storm lashed across the forest, every leaf seemed to vibrate with the chaos outside. The once-hushed silence was filled with the howl of winds and the distant roar of thunder. The trees swayed in anxious breathes, their golden leaves casting long shadows that creased the twilight. I felt the storm gathering, every drop of rain falling in cascades that blurred the boundaries between earth and sky. With each heartbeat, the storm deepened, and the forest, once a sanctuary, now felt alive with peril. It was a silent acknowledgment of the world around me, a reminder that the storm had just arrived, and I was still within it.
