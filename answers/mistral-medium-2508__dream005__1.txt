...each group seems to pull you into their orbit in strange, surreal ways.

First, you stumble upon a circle of people dressed in vintage 1920s attire, laughing as they pass around a glowing, iridescent flask. When they notice you, one of them—a woman with a silver fox stole that *moves on its own*—extends a hand and says, *"You’ve been here before, haven’t you?"* Before you can answer, the fox uncoils from her shoulders and slithers toward you, its eyes reflecting not your face, but a version of you in the same 1920s garb, dancing. You step back, and the group dissolves into a flock of blackbirds that scatter into the ceiling.

Disoriented, you turn and nearly collide with a cluster of people sitting cross-legged on the floor, their hands pressed together in a pyramid. At the center floats a tiny, pulsing sun. *"We’re deciding the weather for next Tuesday,"* a man with three pupils in each eye explains. *"Want to vote? Thunderstorm or golden drizzle?"* When you hesitate, the sun flickers, and suddenly you’re standing in a downpour—except the raindrops are made of molten honey, sticking to your skin. You wipe your arm and the honey solidifies into a fragile, amber bracelet. The group claps. *"A souvenir!"* someone cheers.

Shaken, you push deeper into the crowd, where a long banquet table groans under plates of food that *shouldn’t exist*: a pie that hums when sliced, a bowl of soup that swirls with galaxies, a loaf of bread that *breathes*. A child at the end of the table is methodically eating a plate of clouds. *"They taste like nostalgia,"* she says, offering you a bite. You take it—and suddenly you’re eight years old again, sitting on a porch swing, the air thick with fireflies. When you blink, you’re back, but the child is now an old woman, her plate empty. *"Time’s a funny thing at parties,"* she winks.

Just as panic sets in, you hear *their* laugh—the one person you know. You whirl around and see them across the room, waving frantically. But between you and them, the floor has split open, revealing a spiral staircase descending into darkness. A man in a tailor’s suit (his face a smooth, featureless oval) blocks your path. *"Ah! You’ve been selected for the *Door Game*,"* he says, producing a ring of keys from his sleeve. *"Pick one. But choose wisely—some doors lead to memories, some to lies, and one… well, one leads to *them*."* The keys whisper in your palm, each humming a different tune.

And then—
*(What happens next? Do you:*
1. *Grab the rusted key shaped like a question mark?*
2. *Demand to know the rules (and why the man’s shoes are filled with teeth)?*
3. *Leap over the staircase and sprint for your friend, consequences be damned?*
4. *Or do something else entirely?)*
