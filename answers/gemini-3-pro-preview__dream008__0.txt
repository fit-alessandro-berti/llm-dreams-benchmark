...reach for your keyboard, but the keys have turned into rows of soft, white marshmallows. Every time you try to type, your fingers sink into them, sticky and slow.

You look up at the monitor, hoping to see the project guidelines, but the screen is just a window looking out onto an endless ocean. The "project" is to count every single wave before the sun goes down, but the sun is already melting into the horizon like a pat of butter on a hot skillet.

"Is it done yet?" your boss asks, but when you turn to face him, he isn't a person anymore. He is a giant, ticking stopwatch wearing a tie. The ticking sound is deafening, shaking the floor beneath you.

Suddenly, gravity shifts. The floor becomes a steep slide. Your desk, your chair, and the marshmallow keyboard all slide away from you, tumbling into the darkness. You realize that to finish the work, you have to fly. You flap your arms, and surprisingly, you lift off the ground, swimming through the fluorescent office air, leaving the deadline far below you as the ceiling opens up to reveal a sky full of stars made of paperclips.
