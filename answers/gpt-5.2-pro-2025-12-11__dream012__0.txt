…step onto the slick deck as if it were a stage built just for you. The wind claws at your coat, trying to peel you back into the cabin, but you lift your chin and the rain parts for a heartbeat—enough for the crew to see your face and remember their own.

“Hard to starboard,” you shout, though your voice comes out quieter than you expect, swallowed by thunder. The helmsman nods anyway, because in dreams people understand what you mean more than what you say.

The sea is not merely rough. It is *angry* in a way that feels personal, as if it remembers something you forgot to apologize for. Waves rear up like dark horses, hooves of foam striking the hull. The mast groans, a long wooden complaint, and the ropes writhe in the wind like living things trying to crawl away.

You grip the rail. The wood is warm—impossibly warm—like skin under a blanket.

Lightning splits the sky, and for an instant the world turns inside out: the ocean is above you, the clouds below, and your ship sails not through water but through a ceiling of black glass. The crew doesn’t scream. They simply hold on, eyes wide, waiting for you to decide which way is *down*.

You point forward.

The compass by the helm spins so fast it hums, then stops dead. Its needle doesn’t point north. It points at *you*.

The storm tightens. The air becomes thick, syrupy, hard to breathe. Your orders start to feel like they’re being weighed, measured, judged. When you say “reef the sails,” the words turn into wet birds and fall to the deck, flapping weakly. When you say “steady,” the ship shudders as if offended by the idea.

A crewman—someone you’re certain you’ve known for years though you can’t remember his name—stumbles up to you holding a lantern. The flame inside isn’t fire. It’s a tiny, churning ocean, complete with miniature waves and miniature lightning. He says, very calmly, “Captain, the storm is inside this.”

He offers it to you with both hands.

The lantern’s glass is cold. The storm within throws shadows that move like thoughts. You lift it, and the big storm around the ship leans closer, as if curious to see itself.

Then you realize what the dream has been asking all along: not how to defeat the storm, but whether you will carry it, set it down, or open it.

Behind you, the crew waits—some braced, some praying, some simply watching your hands. Their faces are streaked with rain, but their eyes are clear. They don’t want certainty. They want a decision.

You bring the lantern to the rail.

For a moment you consider throwing it into the sea, letting the ocean swallow its own fury. But the sea feels endless, and you suspect it would only return it later—larger, meaner, more patient.

So instead you lift the latch.

The lantern door swings open with a soft click, and the storm inside doesn’t explode outward. It *inhales*.

Wind rushes in—not to attack, but to be gathered. The thunder folds itself like cloth. The lightning threads into a single bright filament that coils around your wrist, warm and humming like a pulse. The rain thins to mist, then to a fine salt that settles on your tongue.

As the last of the miniature storm slips into the lantern, the sea around you begins to calm, as if relieved to have been unburdened. Waves lower their heads. The ship stops fighting and starts floating again.

Silence arrives awkwardly, like a guest who doesn’t know where to stand.

Your crew releases its breath in a long, collective sound. Someone laughs—small and shaky. Someone else starts to cry, not from fear but from the sudden space where fear used to be. The storm clouds peel back, revealing a sky that is not blue but the color of old paper, covered in faint handwriting you can’t quite read.

The lantern in your hands is heavier now. It tugs gently, as if it has a destination.

You look ahead.

Where the horizon should be, there is a door standing upright on the surface of the water, painted the same color as your childhood bedroom walls. It has no frame. It should topple, but it doesn’t. It simply waits, dignified and impossible.

The compass needle finally moves again—pointing straight at that door.

Your first mate steps beside you and speaks softly, as if afraid to startle the world back into violence. “Captain,” she says, “we can turn back.”

You nod, because turning back is always an option in dreams, in the way it rarely is when you’re awake.

But your hand closes around the lantern handle, and you feel the storm inside it shifting—restless, not angry now, but expectant. Like a question you’ve carried for a long time, finally ready to be answered.

You raise your voice—not to fight the sea, but to guide your people through the quiet. “All hands,” you call. “Easy forward. No rush.”

The ship glides toward the door. The water parts without resistance, as if making room for a truth it has been asked to hold.

As you near it, the door’s knob turns on its own.

Not opening outward or inward, but *sideways*, like a page being turned.

A warm light spills out—not blinding, not holy, just familiar. It smells like oranges and dust and the inside of a book you once loved. You hear a faint sound beyond it: the creak of a wooden floor, a kettle coming to boil, the distant murmur of voices saying your name the way they used to.

Your crew looks to you one last time.

You lift the lantern.

The storm within flickers, then steadies, as if agreeing to be carried.

And as the ship’s bow touches the threshold of the impossible door, you step forward—captain still, but no longer steering against the sea.

You are steering into the part of the dream that has been waiting for you to arrive.
