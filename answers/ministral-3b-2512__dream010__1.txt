**Dream Sequence:**

---

The grand stage of the competition is a vast, neon-lit arena suspended in midair, its walls pulsing with holographic projections of career paths—each one a different industry, each one calling to you in a way that feels *inevitable*. The crowd is a blur of faces, but your eyes are drawn to the center, where a massive, glowing orb hovers above the podium. Inside it, your future job title flickers like a neon sign: **"The Architect of Forgotten Stories."**

The rules are simple: You must *unbuild* something. Not destroy it—*unbuild*. A towering, labyrinthine structure of glass and steel, half-finished, half-abandoned, looms before you. It was meant to be a skyscraper for a forgotten city, but now it’s just a skeletal framework, its purpose lost in time. The judges whisper that the city itself was erased—its people, its history, its very name—by a corporate takeover years ago. The structure is the last remnant of what was.

Your first challenge: **The Memory Thief**. A gaunt, shadowy figure in a tattered suit approaches you, holding a device that looks like a cross between a camera and a time machine. "You can’t just *unbuild* this," they say. "The city’s memories are trapped in the walls. You’ll need to *listen* to them first." They press the device against the base of the tower, and the walls *breathe*. A voice—distorted, layered—emerges from the concrete:

*"We built this to house the future. But the future didn’t come. The future didn’t *want* to come. The people who lived here? They were erased before they could say goodbye. The architect who designed this? Their name was wiped from records. The city? It was never meant to be a city—just a *place* to forget."*

The Memory Thief hands you a set of keys. "You’ll need these to unlock the layers. But be careful—the deeper you go, the more the memories *hate* being remembered."

**Your Move:**
1. **How do you approach the tower?** Do you climb it, descend into its depths, or use the Memory Thief’s device to "peel back" the layers one by one?
2. **What do you do with the memories?** Do you try to *preserve* them (perhaps by recording them, translating them, or even *rebuilding* the city from them), or do you let them fade, letting the past stay buried?
3. **A twist:** As you work, the Memory Thief’s voice grows clearer. *"You’re not the architect of this story. You’re the one who’s been *waiting* to tell it."* What does this mean? Are you the last person who remembers, or the first to *choose* what happens next?
