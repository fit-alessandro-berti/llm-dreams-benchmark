You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panic, but take a deep breath and decide to explore methodically. The architecture around you is impossible—buildings that twist like ribbons, staircases that lead upward only to loop back to where they began.

As you walk, you notice your shadow isn't matching your movements. It pauses when you continue, stretches when you stand still. When you turn to confront it, it waves at you with a hand that isn't yours.

"I know where your meeting is," your shadow says, voice like rustling paper. "But time works differently here. An hour might be a minute or a century."

The sky above shifts from blue to purple to a color you've never seen before—one that makes you feel nostalgic for a place you've never been. Street signs change their text when you try to read them, and your phone shows only a clock with thirteen hours and hands that spin backward.

A cat with eyes like galaxies crosses your path and sits, watching you expectantly. When you kneel to pet it, you find a small key hanging from its collar, warm to the touch and humming faintly.

"The meeting room is inside you," the cat says, though its mouth doesn't move. "The key opens the door you've been carrying all along."

You look down and notice a doorknob has appeared in the center of your chest, right over your heart. With trembling fingers, you insert the key, and as you turn it, the city around you begins to fold like origami, collapsing and reforming into a single, perfect conference room where everyone at the table has your face, and they've all been waiting for you to finally arrive.
