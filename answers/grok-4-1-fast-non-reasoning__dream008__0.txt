You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel your heart racing as the clock ticks louder, morphing into the sound of an alarm. Papers swirl around you like a tornado, numbers and charts blurring into nonsense symbols. You reach for your keyboard, but your fingers turn to jelly, typing gibberish that spells out "HELP" in glowing red letters across every screen in the office.

Your boss's face stretches into a cartoonish grin, eyes bulging like a cartoon villain, demanding, "Why aren't you done yet?!" Colleagues morph into judgmental owls hooting "Deadline! Deadline!" from the ceiling. You bolt for the door, but the floor tilts like a funhouse slide, launching you into a void where the project files rain down as meteors—each one exploding into fireworks of "OVERDUE" stamps.

Suddenly, you're naked in the boardroom, presenting pie charts made of pizza slices to a crowd of your high school teachers. The boss laughs, handing you a trophy labeled "Procrastinator of the Year," and everything dissolves into candy-colored smoke. You wake up in a cold sweat, realizing it was just Thursday morning... and the coffee machine is broken.
