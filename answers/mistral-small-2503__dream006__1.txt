As you begin to speak, your voice echoes through the vast auditorium, filling the silence that had been holding the audience captive. You start with a confident smile, "Good evening, everyone. Thank you for being here tonight."

The crowd murmurs softly, and you can see nods of encouragement from the front rows. You take a deep breath and dive into your prepared remarks. Your words flow smoothly, each sentence building on the last, painting a vivid picture of your vision.

Suddenly, mid-sentence, you notice a strange flicker in the corner of your eye. The lights in the auditorium begin to dim, and the air grows colder. The audience starts to blur, their faces morphing into indistinct shapes. You pause, momentarily confused, but press on, determined to finish your speech.

As you continue, the stage beneath your feet starts to tremble slightly. The trembling grows more pronounced, and you struggle to keep your balance. The audience, now a sea of eerie, faceless figures, begins to murmur in a low, unsettling hum. You try to ignore the growing unease, focusing on your words, but the hum grows louder, drowning out your voice.

The stage lights flicker wildly, casting eerie shadows across the auditorium. The hum turns into a roar, and the audience starts to rise, their faceless forms towering over you. Panic surges through you, but you try to maintain your composure, desperate to finish your speech.

Just as you reach the climax of your address, the stage lights go out completely. The roar from the audience reaches a deafening crescendo, and you feel a powerful force pulling you backward. You struggle to stay upright, but the force is too strong. You stumble, and as you fall, everything goes black.

When you open your eyes again, you find yourself back in your bed, the remnants of the dream still clinging to your consciousness. Your heart is pounding, and you take a deep breath, relieved to be awake. You look around your room, the familiar sights and sounds grounding you in reality. Slowly, the remnants of the dream fade, leaving you with a sense of both relief and lingering unease.
