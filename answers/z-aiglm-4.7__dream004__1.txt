...it stands stark white against the horizon, a rectangle of absolute silence in a screaming world of geometry. You reach out, your hand passing through the air like water, and find a brush resting on a pedestal made of drifting clouds. But when you pick it up, the brush isn't made of bristles; it is a cluster of singing fibers vibrating with a low hum.

You dip the brush into the sky, scooping up a glob of the neon pink clouds swirling overhead. As you touch the tip to the canvas, the paint doesn't spread—it speaks. It hums a melody that tastes like strawberries. You drag a line across the white, and suddenly, the chaotic shifting of the ground beneath your feet slows. The jagged, breathing rocks turn smooth and grey.

Realizing the power you hold, you swirl the brush through the air, gathering the electric blue of a hovering pyramid. Where the blue touches the canvas, gravity shifts. You feel light, your toes lifting off the ground. You paint a sweeping arc of gold, and the sun splits into three, casting shadows that stretch out like welcoming arms.

You paint faster, frantically, trying to bring order to the madness. You stroke a door onto the surface—a heavy, wooden door with a brass knob—and suddenly, the smell of rain and old books fills the air. But the canvas begins to hunger. It pulls at your arm, demanding more color, more reality. You watch, fascinated, as the sleeves of your dream-clothes begin to drain of color, turning transparent as the canvas feeds on the world around you.

Just as you reach out to turn the brass knob you’ve painted, the canvas tilts forward. It isn't a painting anymore; it is a mirror. And looking back at you is a version of yourself made entirely of stained glass. The glass version smiles, raises its hand, and shatters the world into a million glittering shards, leaving you floating in the absolute, quiet dark.
