...feel a surge of anxiety and panic as I look at the project details on my desk. The deadline is not just tight, it's laughable - I'm expected to deliver a comprehensive report, complete with data analysis, visualizations, and recommendations, within a mere 24 hours. I glance up at my boss, who's watching me expectantly, tapping their foot impatiently on the floor.

I try to speak, but my voice catches in my throat. I clear it and attempt to reason with my boss, "Um, isn't this deadline a bit... aggressive? I'm not sure I can possibly..."

But my boss cuts me off, their expression unyielding. "You're the best person for this job," they say firmly. "I have faith in you. Just make it happen."

As they turn to leave, I feel a sense of dread wash over me. I glance around the office, hoping to find some inspiration or a lifeline. The fluorescent lights overhead seem to hum in sync with my racing heart. My colleagues are all busy with their own work, oblivious to my distress.

I look down at the project details again, and my eyes widen as I scan the scope of work. It's a massive project, requiring data collection, research, and analysis on a topic I'm not even familiar with. I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of impossibility.

Suddenly, my computer screen flickers to life, and I see a cryptic message flashing on the monitor - "The coffee machine has the answers." I frown, wondering if I'm already losing my grip on reality.

Do I... go to the coffee machine?
