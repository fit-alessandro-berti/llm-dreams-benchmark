…begin to notice the maze reacting to you.

At first it’s subtle: corridors that were dead ends a moment ago now open into clean, angular passageways, as if your attention is a key. The air tastes faintly like graphite and rain. Somewhere far above—though there is no sky—you hear the slow, patient ticking of a clock that isn’t counting time so much as measuring certainty.

The next chamber is a floor of tiled symbols. Some are familiar—arrows, numbers, simple operators—and others look like they were designed for a kind of mathematics you only half-remember from before you were born. A phrase is carved into the stone at your feet:

**ONLY WHAT YOU HOLD IN MIND CAN BE CROSSED.**

You try to brute-force it, stepping from tile to tile, and the floor blurs. Your foot sinks an inch, as if the maze is gently refusing you. You close your eyes and picture a single, clean rule: *left, right, forward; never back.* When you open them, the tiles rearrange themselves into a narrow, obedient path. You cross without thinking about falling, and the moment you reach the other side the symbols go quiet again.

Further in, you reach a door that has no handle—only a circular depression and a thin slit above it. On the wall beside it is a puzzle etched like a diagram of a brain: loops, branches, a maze inside the maze. The solution feels close and slippery, like a name you can almost say.

You press your palm into the depression.

Nothing.

You press harder, and the slit above your hand exhales a dry breath of dust. Letters appear inside it, one by one, as if typed by an invisible hand:

**WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PROVE?**

The question hits you like a sudden change in gravity. You realize you’ve been solving puzzle after puzzle not to escape, not to reach a treasure or a center, but to justify something you can’t quite articulate. To prove you’re clever enough. Careful enough. Worthy enough.

As soon as you admit that—even silently—the maze shudders. The walls give a soft groan, like a great ship adjusting its weight, and the lines of the diagram shift. The loops loosen. The branches stop fighting each other. A simpler pattern emerges, not because you forced it but because you stopped.

You say, out loud, to no one:

“I’m trying to prove I can make sense of things.”

The door warms beneath your hand. The depression fits your palm now, like it was made for you. The slit prints a second line:

**WHO TAUGHT YOU THAT YOU HAD TO?**

You don’t have an answer, and the maze seems to accept that too. The door unlocks with a sound like a thought clicking into place.

Beyond it is a long gallery full of mirrors—tall, old, silvered glass in ornate frames. Each mirror shows you in a different part of the maze: crouched over symbols, straining, sweating, jaw tight; walking quickly with anxious purpose; standing frozen at intersections, afraid of choosing wrong.

One mirror shows you turning around and leaving a puzzle unsolved.

And you look…fine.

Not punished. Not erased. Not trapped.

Just…fine.

The maze grows quieter, as if it’s been waiting for you to notice that.

At the end of the gallery sits a table with two objects: a piece of chalk and a small brass bell. Another inscription is carved into the tabletop:

**WRITE THE EXIT OR RING FOR IT.**

You pick up the chalk. It feels unusually heavy, like it contains every answer you’ve ever hunted. You draw a rectangle: a door. You add a knob. You draw hinges. You’re careful, precise—then you hesitate. The door looks perfect, but the air doesn’t change. The maze doesn’t move.

You try again, sketching a more elaborate door with runes and locks and symbols that imply you’ve earned the right to pass.

Still nothing.

Your hand cramps. Your mind starts to race: *Maybe it’s the wrong chalk. Maybe the shape has to be exact. Maybe I need the right equation. Maybe—*

You set the chalk down.

You pick up the bell.

It’s small enough to fit in your fist, and when you lift it you feel an irrational wave of embarrassment, like asking for help is a kind of failure the maze will record forever. Your fingers tighten anyway. You ring it once.

The sound is impossibly clear—one bright note that travels down every corridor at once. The maze answers with a low, affectionate hum, like a giant recognizing your voice.

A seam appears in the air beside the table, vertical and thin as a hairline crack. It widens into a doorway made of nothing but absence, the edges shimmering as if the world is remembering how to open.

On the other side is not sunlight or a street or your bedroom.

It’s a simple room with a single chair and a window. The window shows a familiar place you can’t quite name, like a childhood afternoon you lost and never admitted you missed. The ticking clock you heard earlier is here, but it’s quieter—less demanding. More like breathing.

As you step through, you glance back.

The maze isn’t collapsing. It isn’t angry. It isn’t even closing the door to keep you out. It’s simply waiting, puzzles at rest, like books on shelves. You realize, with a strange tenderness, that the maze was never a prison.

It was a mind doing what minds do: building problems to feel safe.

You take one more step into the room, and the doorway behind you becomes a plain wall. Not locked—just no longer necessary.

The chair waits, and you sit.

On the windowsill is a final message, scratched lightly into the paint as if by someone with a restless fingertip:

**YOU CAN COME BACK WHEN YOU WANT.  
YOU CAN ALSO STOP.**

You look at your hands—still dusted with chalk—and feel the tension drain out of your shoulders. For the first time since entering, you don’t try to solve anything.

You just watch the light shift across the floor.

And that’s when you wake up, with the lingering sense that somewhere inside you, a bell is still ringing—softly, patiently—reminding you that exits don’t always have to be earned.
