You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you—  

—hesitate, your heart racing as if the weight of the city’s chaos has settled in your chest. But their voices are calm, overlapping like a melody: *“We’ve been here before,”* says a woman with a scar tracing her eyebrow, her eyes sharp yet gentle. *“Follow us,”* adds a teenager in a mismatched coat, holding out a map that glows faintly, as though lit by the city’s neon.  

They lead you through winding alleys and over bridges where the skyline blurs into constellations. A man with a beard like tangled smoke hums a tune that makes the pigeons pause mid-flight. A child with a pocket full of keys giggles, unlocking doors to hidden gardens where flowers bloom in impossible colors. You ask where you’re going, but they only smile. *“Not a place,”* the woman says. *“A feeling.”*  

They take you to a rooftop where the city hums beneath your feet. The air is thick with the scent of rain and jasmine. The teenager hands you a cup of something warm that tastes like home, though you’ve never been there. The man with the beard points to the horizon, where a single streetlight flickers like a star. *“That’s where you’re meant to go,”* he says. *“But you’ll need to walk it yourself.”*  

As the strangers vanish into the crowd, their voices linger: *“You’re never truly alone here.”* You clutch the map, now cool in your hands, and step forward. The city still buzzes, but now its noise feels like a song—and for the first time, you hear your own rhythm in it.
