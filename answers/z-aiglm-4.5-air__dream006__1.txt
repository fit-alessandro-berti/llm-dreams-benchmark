As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to **speak... but the words don't come out as you planned. Instead of the carefully crafted speech you rehearsed, a stream of shimmering, liquid light pours from your lips.**

It doesn't sound like speech at all; it's more like a melody, a cascade of pure sound and color that fills the auditorium. The audience doesn't seem surprised; their faces light up with recognition, their eyes reflecting the hues flowing from you. You notice the stage beneath your feet isn't wood, but cool, smooth obsidian that hums softly in harmony with your voice.

The shimmering light coalesces above the crowd, forming constellations that shift and dance. You realize you're not giving a speech *at* them, but *with* them, the collective energy of the room feeding back into the luminous river flowing from you. The podium dissolves into mist as you step forward, your feet barely touching the obsidian stage.

The melody shifts, becoming deeper, resonant. You understand, without needing words, that this is the collective memory of the room – stories of joy, sorrow, triumph, and quiet moments of connection, all woven together in the light. You aren't performing; you are conducting an orchestra of shared humanity. The crowd sways gently, some raising their hands, as if they are touching the tangible emotions now hanging in the air like giant, glowing bubbles.

Suddenly, a profound sense of peace washes over you. The fear vanishes, replaced by an overwhelming feeling of belonging. You realize the stage wasn't a place of judgment, but a conduit. You open your heart wider, and the light intensifies, bathing everyone in a warm, golden glow. The melody resolves into a single, resonant chord that vibrates through your bones and seems to linger in the air long after the stage dissolves beneath you, leaving you floating gently down into the warm, expectant crowd, no longer separate, but part of the beautiful, luminous whole you helped create. The applause that erupts isn't sound, but a wave of pure, shared warmth that envelops you completely.
