…slip into them like pressing buttons on an old elevator, each world cycling in place with that familiar, dream-tuned syncopation.

### 1. The Orchestra of Strangers  
A knot of people in black tuxedos and white gloves stands on a vast, mirrored stage. No one is moving—except their music, an electronic orchestra whose notes materialize mid-air and bloom into colored sand. As you step in, the sand rearranges itself into the face of the person you came to find, then dissolves again. No one speaks; the conductor only gestures with his bow, and every time it arcs, another guest trades places with you, like a cut-scene loading loop.

### 2. The Spare-Key Lobby  
You’re in a hallway lined with coat racks bearing thousands of identical housekeys. Each spin of a rack produces a new door sound: somewhere a kettle whistling, somewhere a door slammed in frustration. One lock—that you swear wasn’t there a moment ago—yields when you touch it. Inside is a cozy, book-lined room where a writer you adore is lighting candles that burn photographs instead of wax. She waves you over, but before you reach her the lights flicker, and when they come back the room is the restroom you passed on the way in.

### 3. The Carousel of Lost Food  
A slow-moving carousel spins bland, plastic-wrapped snacks. Every visitor is allowed one free bite, but the moment you put something in your mouth you forget its taste. Immediately you mourn it. Someone offers to let you share the experience of remembering together, but it only spreads the amnesia like a Wi-Fi signal. The ride operator, a child who billows breath like a dragon, offers you a deal: if you can name the one food you’ve already lost, he’ll rewind the carousel so it restarts with a different snack queue.

### 4. The Silent Swimming Pool  
Chunks of ice drift across a yard-wide pool. Everyone here is barefoot, weightless, conversing in near silence. You tap a rhythm on the surface—your heartbeat—but you can’t tell whether others share it. One swimmer pops up, grabs your wrist, and writes a name in topographic ink across your forearm: the name of the person you’re seeking. When he lets go, the name dissolves into gooseflesh, leaving no trace. You look around; everyone’s arms bear the same set of disappearing words.

*(The dream loops here, but each repetition adds a half-second flicker of daylight sheeting the mirrors, knocks a raspberry note off the orchestra, causes one candle to turn into an origami bird. Eventually the carousel stops, the ink stays, and someone’s laughing—your one familiar friend—calls to you from across a final door you both seem to remember.)*
