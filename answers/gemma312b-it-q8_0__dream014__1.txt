You are feeling lost and you are alone in a bustling, unfamiliar city. Towering skyscrapers, painted in a bizarre mix of hot pink and turquoise, leaned inwards, blotting out the sky. Millions of people – faceless, rushing blur of limbs and bright fabrics – jostled past, ignoring you. Their chatter rose in an oppressive wall of sound, further accentuating the quiet hum of disorientation in your own head. The map clasped tight in your trembling hand felt small, crumpled, utterly useless. You felt a hot tear prickle your eye.

Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you… hesitate. Years of watching films about cunning disguises and hidden dangers bubble up. A prickle of suspicion crawled across your skin, yet the weary ache inside you was overwhelming. The city, their anonymity, your mounting despair – it all argued heavily in favor of accepting. You looked up at them slowly.

They weren’t menacing. Perhaps a little quirky, true. They stood arranged in an oddly delightful jumble – an enormous elderly woman with a vibrant purple parasol, a skinny artist-esque boy with vibrant green hair, and a young, earnest man perpetually smiling as he adjusted a collection of tiny succulents perched atop his messenger bag. 

The purple parasol lowered slightly. "Lost, dear?" inquired the elder woman, her voice warm and laced with the lilting tone of… where exactly were they from? Some country you’d never known, filled with sunshine and laughter.

You just nodded, tears escaping and tracing damp rivulets down your cheek. “I... I was headed to the Clockwood Theater… but… I don’t know which way anymore."  

The green-haired ragazzo immediately piped up, snapping his fingers. "Clockwood? Fantastic theater! Right this way!"  Without giving you a chance to respond, he began bouncing down the street, their group reforming effortlessly behind him.

You glanced at the succulents-lad, who gave you a comforting, slow smile and a thumbs-up.  He didn'g say anything, just started following the ragazzo at an even pace with you following closely behind.

As you walked, the city seemed to change subtly. Harsh angles softened into rounded features, the cacophony muted into a pleasant hum. They started telling stories - fantastical tales of rooftop gardens visited by fireflies and bakeries run by mischievous gremlins who only baked cakes shaped like stars in the afternoon. The more they talked, the more you found yourself genuinely laughing, your anxieties melting a little deeper.  The bright colours around you didn’s feel overwhelming now but vibrantly cheerful. 

Soon, the towering skyscrapers gave way to cozy brick dwellings adorned with twinkling fairy lights. It seemed like they had unconsciously led your through a secret district of vibrant warmth hidden beneath the steel and concrete.

Finally, they stopped before a magnificent old-style theatre – the Clockwood – gleaming warmly with welcoming lights and decorated a vibrant climbing rose around the entrance.

"Have a glorious performance, love! Remember," said purple parasol, leaning in to give your cheek a gentle squeeze,"the magic is finding your way *when* feeling lost."

Then, just as suddenly as they’d appeared, they vanished, leaving behind a faint scent of warm spice and the subtle chime of playful melody drifting on the wind – all you were left. Turning to the theater felt different than before. It felt comforting and inviting. You had a deep feeling as if this had not only brought you closer to the clockwood theater, but somewhere entirely new. You took a deep breath, smiled a genuine smile – it felt light and strangely liberating–.

Then you realised where you recognized that chime… the sound from a children’s music box from your room. Your face dissolved into an expression of utter bewilderment. What had happened?. As you opened your hand it was holding a single, luminous purple rose with a spiral of golden light blooming along its petals.… then everything swirled back into dark.
