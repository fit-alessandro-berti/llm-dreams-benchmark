...find shelter before nightfall. The air is cool and carries the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke. The buildings around you are simple, made of timber and wattle, with thatched roofs. People are dressed in rough-spun wool and linen, their faces smudged with dirt and weathered by a life of hard work. You understand their language, a guttural and archaic form of English, and you gather you are in a village in Anglo-Saxon England.

Your modern knowledge is a useless, buzzing artifact in your mind—until you hear the worried murmurs of the villagers. Their chieftain, a stout man named Wulfric, is gravely ill. The local healer has tried poultices and chants, but a fever rages, and a wound on his leg is festering, hot with the promise of death.

You remember a fragment from a documentary, something about mold. Not the magic bullet of penicillin, but the folk wisdom behind it. The principle. It’s a desperate, insane gamble.

You approach the healer, an old woman with eyes like chips of flint. "I may have a way," you say, your accent strange to their ears.

She scoffs. "The spirits will not listen to an outsider."

"Then we will not ask them," you reply. "We will ask the earth itself."

You have them bring you a loaf of the coarsest, oldest barley bread they can find. You leave it in a dark, damp corner of a storage hut. For two days, you tend to Wulfric as best you can, cleaning the wound with clean boiled water—a simple act that alone seems to help—and keeping him cool. The village watches you, a mixture of suspicion and desperate hope in their eyes.

On the third day, you retrieve the bread. A splotch of blue-green mold has grown perfectly on its surface. Your heart hammers. This is it. This is the leap of faith.

Under the healer's wary gaze, you carefully scrape the mold. You don't have a way to purify it, to isolate the compound. You have to use the crude substance itself. You mix it with a little clean water and honey, which you know has mild antibacterial properties, to form a paste.

"You would put rot into a chieftain's body?" the healer whispers, horrified.

"I would put life into it, to fight the death that is already there," you say, and before anyone can stop you, you apply the poultice to the hot, swollen wound.

The night is long. You sit by Wulfric's side, listening to his ragged breathing. You doubt yourself. What if a different, toxic mold grew? What if it's too late? What if you've just hastened the end of a man who rules these people?

Just before dawn, his fever breaks. The sweat cools on his skin. He sleeps, a true and peaceful sleep, for the first time in days.

When he wakes, weak but clear-eyed, the village looks at you not as a stranger, but as something else. A sorcerer? A sage? The healer brings you a carved wooden cup of ale. She doesn't speak, but she bows her head slightly. The gesture is more profound than any words.

You have no way home. The modern world is a fading dream. But here, in this age of smoke and soil, you have done something impossible. You have brought a sliver of the future to the past, not as a weapon, but as a mercy. And as the sun rises over the timbered hall, you realize your dream is just beginning. You are not just a visitor anymore. You are a part of this story.
