...tiny, bioluminescent veins that pulse in time with your own heartbeat. The material드 substance that feels like frozen smoke들s warm to the touch, and as your fingers trace the carvings, the box begins to hum a melody you haven't heard since you were a child.

You realize there is no keyhole because the box isn뇺 locked by a mechanism; it is bound by a memory. 

As you stare at the lid, the patterns begin to shift and rearrange themselves like a slow-motion kaleidoscope. They form the shape of a constellation that doesn't exist in our sky. You lean closer, and the air around you grows heavy with the scent of rain on hot pavement and crushed jasmine. 

Without thinking, you whisper a word드 secret you didn't know you were keeping. 

The lid doesn't click or pop open. Instead, it softens, turning from solid smoke into clear, still water. You reach your hand inside, and rather than hitting the bottom of a wooden chest, your arm plunges into a cool, weightless void. 

You pull out a single, glowing feather that weighs as much as a mountain. As you hold it, the room around you begins to dissolve. The walls of the dream curl upward like burning paper, revealing a vast, violet ocean beneath a sky filled with three moons. 

You look down at the feather in your hand, and it begins to grow, weaving itself into a great silver wing attached to your own shoulder. The box is gone, the room is gone, and you realize the lock wasn't there to keep you out of the box들t was there to keep you inside the world you just left behind. 

You take a step into the violet air, and you finally fly.
