The strangers paused their initial steps, their faces softened by the amber glow of distant streetlights. One of them—a woman with a sketchbook clutched like a compass—paused her own conversation, noticing your blank expression. "You’ve carried shadows too long," she said gently, sauntering closer. You hesitated, then nodded weakly. The woman’s hand brushed yours briefly, warm and urgent, as if to steady you. Together, they navigated past chaotic walls, past flickering signs of a forgotten town, until they reached a silent park where a child-laid bench sat under weeping willow trees. Its branches cradled a single lantern, flickering with the fire of unknown nights. She knelt, picking up its base, revealing a small map etched beneath—a maze of streets, a bridge, a path none had charted before. Your hands trembled as you held it up, and for a heartbeat, the city’s noise dissolved into the rustle of leaves. "For what’s left of usendown," she murmured, her voice a river winding through you both. "Perhaps here, in this silence, you’re not alone anymore." The city faded around them, replaced by the scent of rain-soaked earth and the quiet promise of seeds waiting to bloom. You stepped forward, not to find answers, but to let the path ahead be your own—still bright with possibility, still yours to hold. 

The dream lingered not in resolve, but in the quiet understanding: sometimes, light doesn’t just arrive—it arrives *inside*, often beneath unwritten signs.
