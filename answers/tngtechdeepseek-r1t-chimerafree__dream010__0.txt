**Dream Continuation:**

As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and find yourself in a surreal, ever-shifting arena. The first task is a team-based puzzle: a labyrinth of floating platforms suspended over an abyss, each etched with cryptic symbols. Your team must decode them to navigate forward. Though tension flares, you discover an unexpected synergy, blending your analytical mind with others’ creativity to reach the exit.  

The next challenge is solitary—a room that morphs into your childhood bedroom, now filled with gears and wires. A voice booms: *"Build something that defines your passion."* Your hands move instinctively, crafting a miniature model of a city that hums with renewable energy, a vision of the future you’ve always imagined.  

The final trial is the strangest. You stand before a mirror that reflects not your face, but a version of you from a decade ago. It asks, *"What would you tell yourself?"* You speak of resilience and curiosity, and the glass shatters, revealing a stage. The judges—shadowy figures with glowing eyes—applaud.  

You wake just as they announce the winner, but the dream lingers. The real prize wasn’t the job, but the unshakable certainty that you’re ready for it.
