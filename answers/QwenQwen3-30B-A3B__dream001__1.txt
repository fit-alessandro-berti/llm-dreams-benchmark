You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to run, but the streets shift beneath your feet, twisting into impossible spirals. Buildings stretch and contract like living things, their windows flickering with faces that vanish when you look directly at them. A clock tower in the distance chimes, but its hands spin backward, and the air hums with the sound of a thousand whispers.  

You flag down a figure in a tattered coat, their face obscured by a mask of shifting symbols. "Where is the meeting?" you demand. They tilt their head, and their voice echoes like a broken record: *"It’s where you’ve already been."* Before you can respond, they dissolve into a cascade of origami birds, fluttering into the sky.  

Panic surges. You sprint through alleys that lead to identical alleys, each one more labyrinthine than the last. A streetlamp flickers, revealing a map etched into the pavement—a map that redraws itself as you stare. You trace a path, but the ink bleeds into a storm of inkblots. A child’s laughter rings out, and you turn to see a figure holding a compass that points not north, but *backward*.  

Suddenly, the city fractures. The sky splits into panels, each revealing a different version of the same street: one lined with neon signs in a language you almost recognize, another with trees growing upward into a starless void. You stumble into a plaza where a crowd of faceless people stands, all staring at a giant, floating hourglass. The sand is falling *upward*.  

A voice, deep and resonant, booms: *"You are late, but the meeting is not a place. It is the moment you choose to stop running."* The words hang in the air as the city begins to dissolve, buildings melting into liquid light. You feel a pull, a sudden clarity—*the meeting was never external*. It was here, in the chaos, in the surrender.  

As the dream fades, you wake with a start, your heart racing, but somehow... lighter. The clock reads 9:59 a.m. You have exactly one minute to act.
