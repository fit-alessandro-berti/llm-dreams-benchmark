…the sky darkens to a shade of deep violet. A cold wind snakes through the trees, carrying the scent of rain and something else—something electric.

The leaves begin to rustle more violently, as if the forest itself is whispering warnings. You brace yourself, but instead of thunder, you hear a distant humming, low and steady, like a giant machine awakening beneath the earth.

The first raindrop falls—warm, not cold—and when it hits your skin it glows faintly. You look up. The clouds are swirling in impossible patterns, spirals within spirals, and from their center a column of shimmering light begins to descend.

As the storm rushes in around you, you realize the light is not frightening. In fact, it feels familiar. Comforting. It touches the tops of the tallest trees, and the entire forest illuminates with bioluminescent greens and blues. The humming grows louder, resolving into something like music.

Then a figure steps out from between the trees ahead of you—silhouetted by the glowing rain. Tall, graceful, with eyes like reflected lightning. They raise a hand toward you, as if inviting you to come closer.

You feel the ground vibrating gently beneath your feet. The air shimmers. The storm is no longer something happening to the forest—it’s something happening through it.

And you somehow know:
This is not just a storm.
It is a message.

What would you like to happen next in the dream?
