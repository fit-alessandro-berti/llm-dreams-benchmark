Okay, entering the dream state...

...you look down at your desk, ready to start, but the computer screen is blank. Not off, just... blank. A void. You tap the mouse, hit keys – nothing. Panic starts to bubble in your chest. You glance up at your boss, but they aren't looking at you anymore. They're slowly, deliberately stacking staplers into a precarious, impossibly tall tower on the edge of your desk. Each *click* of a stapler being added echoes unnaturally loud in the suddenly silent office.

You look back at the screen. It flickers, and instead of your desktop, it shows a live feed of... yourself, staring at the screen, looking increasingly stressed. You try to grab the mouse again, but your hand feels heavy, clumsy, like it's encased in setting jelly. You look down at your hands – they *are* turning translucent, shimmering slightly, like Jell-O.

The stapler tower wobbles dangerously. Your boss places another one on top with excruciating care, humming a tune that sounds suspiciously like elevator music played backwards.

You try to speak, to explain about the computer, the jelly hands, the *everything*, but only a faint buzzing sound comes out, like a trapped fly. The project brief, which you hadn't even looked at yet, suddenly unrolls itself from your desk like a party streamer, snaking across the floor and out the door. It's covered in symbols that shift and swim before your eyes, none of them making any sense.

The deadline feels less like a time and more like a physical weight pressing down on the room. The lights flicker. The stapler tower sways. Your boss turns, their eyes now glowing faintly red, and whispers, "The deliverables. They hunger." And you realize your chair is slowly sinking into the floor, which now feels suspiciously soft, like quicksand made of lukewarm coffee. The buzzing in your throat gets louder, and the blank screen seems to pull you closer... closer...
