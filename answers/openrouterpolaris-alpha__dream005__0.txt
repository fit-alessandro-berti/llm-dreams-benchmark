…every cluster feels like its own small country with its own language.

To your left: a circle of people laughing too loudly at something you didn’t hear. You drift closer, hoping to catch a familiar voice, but all you hear are overlapping anecdotes about projects and vacations and someone’s new dog. Their faces seem almost right, just shy of recognizable, like actors from a show you can’t place. When you try to focus on one of them, their features rearrange—eyes reposition, cheekbones sharpen, a beard appears and then is gone. No one seems to notice. You back away before they look at you.

You move toward the kitchen, because kitchens are safe in gatherings. In this one, light pours from nowhere and everywhere at once. There is a group around the counter, reverent, passing around a bowl of shimmering fruit. Each piece shifts subtly: an apple that, when you blink, becomes a glass heart; a cluster of grapes that glows gently like purple coals. A woman offers you one. You ask, “Have you seen—” and you insert your friend’s name, but it comes out muffled, under water. No one acknowledges what you said; instead they nod solemnly, as though you’ve agreed to something. You put the fruit down. It leaves a faint, luminous thumbprint on your skin that does not wipe off.

In the living room, the sound changes. Here the group is arranged on sofas in a perfect semi-circle around a man explaining the rules of a game that has no obvious components. They follow his words with absolute focus. You try to understand:

“So when you realize you’ve already lost,” he says cheerfully, “that’s when you’re allowed to start.”

Everyone nods, relieved, as if this clarifies everything.

“Sorry,” you say, “I’m just looking for—”

“Then you’re in the right place,” he interrupts, delighted. “Losing track is the first step.”

They smile at you with the gentle pressure of people who’ve already decided you’ll stay. You excuse yourself. Your voice sounds weak and papery.

You pass a group lining a hallway as if they’re waiting for something. They hold drinks that hang motionless in the air when they gesture. Conversation here is different: it’s synchronized. You realize, with a slow chill, they're all telling the same story at once, word for word, with the same laughs at the same beats, but to different invisible audiences. As you listen, their overlapping words form a soft mechanical purr. You search their faces for your friend; the repetition makes them blend into one multi-headed host.

At the far end of the hall, a door stands slightly open, pulsing with the murmur of another party. You’re sure your friend is there. As you reach for the handle, a hand touches your shoulder.

You turn. It’s your friend’s jacket, your friend’s posture, your friend’s hair from last year, but the face is frustratingly out of focus, as though the dream refuses to render it. You feel the immediate calm that comes with recognition, even without confirmation.

“There you are,” you say, exhaling. “I’ve been trying to find you. These people are—”

“—busy,” they say. Their voice comes through perfectly. “Come on. You’ll miss it.”

“Miss what?” You glance back at the shifting groups, unsure which “it” they could mean.

Your friend steps past you and pushes the door fully open. On the other side: another enormous room, impossibly larger than the building itself. It’s full of people, yes, but impossibly still. Frozen mid-laugh, mid-drink, mid-gesture. The music here is held between beats. Something like glitter or dust hangs in the air, suspended.

“They’re waiting for you,” your friend says.

“For me?” You laugh, but the sound doesn’t quite leave your throat.

“You were looking for one person,” they say. “You’ve been walking past them the entire time.”

You look more closely at the frozen guests. In each stalled expression, each half-turned body, you recognize a fraction of someone you’ve been. Your high school self, your anxious first-day-at-work self, the version of you that left, the one that stayed, the one that never said anything, the one that said too much. All dressed for a party you don’t remember agreeing to attend.

“They only move,” your friend says softly, “when you talk to them.”

“But I’m trying to find you,” you insist.

“I know,” they say. “But you only know me because of them.”

They gesture toward the still crowd. The nearest figure—an old you with tired eyes and a familiar shirt—blinks, slowly, as if surfacing. Their gaze meets yours. You feel the weight of an old decision that you never stopped arguing with. You look away, but everywhere you look, another almost-you is waiting, patient, paused.

You turn back to your friend for help.

Only now they’re standing among the frozen guests. Their jacket is different—a version from another year, another city. When you try to move toward them, you realize your feet are rooted; the floor is soft, like thick carpet or damp soil. The more you struggle, the deeper your shoes sink.

“Just pick one,” your friend says. Their voice is echoing slightly, as if from the bottom of a stairwell. “Any one. The rest will wait. They’re good at that.”

You reach out, straining, and your glowing thumbprint from the fruit brushes the nearest still shoulder. At your touch, that version of you inhales sharply and turns, fully alive.

“Oh,” they say, smiling like they’ve been expecting you. “There you are. I’ve been trying to find you.”

The room exhales. Time lurches forward. The music crashes back in, a little too loud. Laughter erupts from every direction, overlapping. All the frozen versions of you begin to move among the crowd, invisible to everyone else, or maybe not. They mingle with the many-faced strangers, all looking, all circling, each convinced they’re searching for one steady, familiar point.

You’re not sure anymore whether you’ve found your friend or become them.

Then someone behind you says your name in exactly the right way.

You turn—

—and wake up with the sensation that the party is still going on without you, and that somewhere in that bright, impossible house, you are still politely weaving through strangers, looking for a face you’ve always known, and almost recognizing your own each time you pass it.
