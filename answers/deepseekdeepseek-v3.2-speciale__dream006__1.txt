You step onto the stage, the audience hushed and expectant. As you open your mouth to begin, you realize you’re not holding any notes—yet the words pour out effortlessly, clear and confident. But something is off: the crowd's faces begin to ripple like water, shifting into the visages of people from your past, each one staring intently. Their eyes start to glow a soft gold, and the auditorium walls melt away, revealing a starry night sky. The stage floor turns to grass beneath your feet, and you continue speaking, your voice echoing as if in a vast canyon. Just as you reach the climax of your speech, a gentle breeze sweeps through, and you realize you are dreaming. With that awareness, the dream fades, and you drift into wakefulness, the memory of the speech lingering like a half‑remembered song.
