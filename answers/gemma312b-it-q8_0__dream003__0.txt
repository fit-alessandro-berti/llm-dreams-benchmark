...symbols etched into its obsidian-gloss surface, rippling as if the dark stone breathed. The patterns *moved,* not in a sudden, frantic shift, but subtle, incremental adjustments - constellations realigning, geometric shapes subtly bending. And then a sound – a chime so faint you’re not sure if you heard it, like distant, submerged bells. 

Panicked, I looked around. Suddenly I wasn't in front of the box any more. Instead, I was standing in a library taller than any cathedral could achieve. Books shelved to dizzying heights disappeared into shadow above, and dust motes, catching the muted gold light filtered from improbable stained glass windows, spiraled around me like glittering souls. The floor, vast and polished, reflected that light back, creating an eerie luminescence.

That’s when I understood. The box wasn’s the important thing. The library *was* the key. And the key wasn’t a metal trinket, no, it was understanding. Understanding…what?

I tentatively started examining the books nearest me. Titles in forgotten languages scrolled past. One caught my eye and shimmered with the same light as the box: *The Echoes of Convergence*. It wasn't printed; the words seemed woven into the leather cover itself.

As I reached for the book, a voice, disembodied and genderless, resonated within my mind. "To unlock the box," it murmured, “you must remember *what you have lost*." 

Panic flared anew. What *had* I lost? A toy? A loved one? A memory? The effort, the sheer force of reaching desperately into swirling fog in my mind, began creating an ache behind my temples. The faces of people flitted by - a grandmother’s smile, a child’s laughter… too fleeting, indistinct.  

Ignoring the pain,  I focused, picturing, *remembering.*  There! A feeling. A specific memory, surprisingly vivid: learning to whistle, on a sunny afternoon, under an apple tree still laden with fruit. My first, clumsy, joyful attempt at a tune I now desperately and vaguely remembered being something precious.

As that image solidified – the warmth of the sun, the fragrance of apples, the feeling of breathless triumph when that first, imperfect sound left my lips – the library shimmered. Shelves dissolved, merging into an enormous wall that folded back upon itself to reveal...the box was back. Exactly as it was. But now, a single star, bright blue and utterly distinct, pulsed subtly within one of the intricate carvings. 

Reaching out cautiously and tracing that single blue star in my fingertip…the box clicked. And a single perfect apple, the colour of late sunlight, rolled gracefully forth onto the floor. It emanate warmth. A scent not of apples, but of everything remembered and everything hoped of. An end was in sight…

Then I heard someone call my name... and I started to wake. The taste of apples lingered just behind my lips.
