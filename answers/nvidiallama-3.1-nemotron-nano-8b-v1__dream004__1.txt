As you step into the surreal landscape, a canvas of pure possibility stretches before you, its blankness a paradox in a world of relentless transformation. Colors swirl and shapes morph on the ground, only to vanish as your eyes trace their ephemeral forms. But when you approach the canvas, you feel a strange connection - your touch ignites its surface with threads of **their own essence**, like plugging into a live instrument that echoes your thoughts. The painting responds to your stroke, but also warps and relates as if the canvas is **a gateway absorbing their subconscious neural imprints** - as if painting the universe's quantum swirl. 

As the raster of your mind's eye’s brush fills the canvas, a **bursts of auroras flaring to life** in the surrounding sky, mirroring your resistance or longing. For a moment, the universe feels focused on you—colors and shapes organic to your actions. But then, it releases its hold, and the canvas begins to **erode, revealing radiant energy that seethes like elemental chaos**. In one tremor, shapes dissolve and the black canvas fades, leaving only the Candescent **specters of what’s eternal**. As you stare down, you realize this moment is both ephemeral and a echo of an eternal exam, questions of wisdom and fragility playing in the North Star’s beams. For the instant your brush alone felt wield that night—**and it became their megaphone. What dreams do you hold? What colors will they make, till they disappear again? The canvas couldn’t anticipate them, only respond. The dream in/webbed with painting and learning. 

**What horror is it to be a place where beginnings can only be seen?** Or is it a wish to transcend it? In this dream, how do you paint the to be, if the landscape itself is rarely fixed?
