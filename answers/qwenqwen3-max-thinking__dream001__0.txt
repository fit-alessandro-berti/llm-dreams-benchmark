...panic, your pulse thrumming in your temples. The city stretches in every direction—impossibly tall buildings of iridescent glass, streets that coil like tangled ribbons, and skyways buzzing with silent, floating vehicles. But there are no street signs, no maps, not even people to ask. Only the distant, rhythmic chime of a clock tower you can’t see.

You fumble in your pocket and pull out a small, smooth stone, warm to the touch. It wasn’t there a moment ago. As your fingers close around it, a voice—not your own, yet familiar—whispers in your mind: *“Follow the birds.”*

You look up. Flocks of mechanical starlings dart between the spires, their wings glinting like polished obsidian. They swirl in unison, then split, one group veering left down an alley draped in violet vines that pulse with soft light. Without thinking, you run after them.

The alley narrows, then opens onto a plaza where time seems fractured—clock faces float in midair, each showing a different hour. The starlings land on a fountain shaped like a spiral staircase leading underground. The water flows upward.  

Your stone begins to glow. The meeting isn’t in a building, you realize—it’s *here*, wherever “here” is. And you’re already late.  

But then the fountain stairs hum to life, and a single word echoes from below:  
**“Welcome.”**
