You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panic, your heart thrumming like a trapped bird. Buildings tower around you, a dizzying mix of styles – gothic spires next to sleek, mirrored skyscrapers, ornate Victorian facades abutting structures that seem to be grown from shimmering crystal. The streets are a chaotic river of people, none of whom look familiar, speaking in languages that sound like tinkling bells and grinding gears.

My hands instinctively go to my pockets. Empty. No phone, no wallet, not even a scrap of paper. Just... a smooth, warm stone that seems to pulse faintly in my palm. I squeeze it, a desperate plea for guidance. The stone grows warmer, and a faint hum vibrates through my hand, up my arm, settling in my chest. It feels like a compass, a subtle tug pulling me towards the *right*.

I start to walk, letting the stone be my guide. The city unfolds around me like a bizarre, living map. I pass a market stall selling fruit that glows with an internal light, a park where the trees sing in harmony with the wind, and a fountain that sprays not water, but shimmering, iridescent bubbles that float and burst with tiny, musical chimes.

The pull of the stone becomes stronger as I turn a corner and see, looming ahead, a building unlike any other. It's not made of stone or glass, but of interwoven branches, leaves, and flowers, a living structure that seems to breathe and sway in the gentle breeze. At its entrance, a woman with eyes like emeralds and hair like woven vines stands waiting. She smiles, a knowing, welcoming smile.

"You're here," she says, her voice like the rustling of leaves. "We've been expecting you."

And, with a surge of relief mingled with utter bewilderment, I realize, somehow, I've arrived.
