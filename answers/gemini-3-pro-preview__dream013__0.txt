...begin to realize that the logic is no longer mathematical, but emotional.

The stone walls start to pulse like a heartbeat. The symbols etched into the surfaces detach and float in the air, glowing with a soft, indigo light. You solve a riddle involving a clock that runs backward, and suddenly, gravity shifts; you are walking on the ceiling, yet it feels perfectly natural.

You reach the center of the maze, where the final puzzle awaits: it is a mirror that does not reflect your face, but rather a place you haven't visited since you were a child. You realize with a jolt of lucid clarity that the solution isn't a thought, but a feeling. You take a deep breath, release the tension in your shoulders, and step through the glass like it is water, dissolving the maze into a vast, star-filled sky where you are finally free to fly.
