You start to wander the streets, your heart pounding with a mix of anxiety and curiosity. The city is a labyrinth of towering skyscrapers that twist like living vines, their windows reflecting distorted versions of your face as you pass. Neon signs flicker in languages you don't understand, and the crowds swirl around you like a river of shadows, each person muttering fragments of conversations that sound like forgotten memories.

As the clock in your mind ticks down—sixty minutes, fifty-nine, fifty-eight—you pull out a crumpled map from your pocket, but it keeps changing, the lines shifting into abstract patterns that lead nowhere. A street vendor with eyes that glow like city lights offers you a compass, but when you take it, it spins wildly, pointing to a hidden alleyway. You follow it, only to emerge in a vast park where time seems to slow, and the trees whisper secrets about the meeting. Is it a job interview? A long-lost reunion? Or something more profound, like a confrontation with your deepest fears?

Suddenly, you spot a grand clock tower in the distance, its hands racing backward. You run toward it, but the ground turns soft and elastic, pulling you down like quicksand. Just as the hour strikes and the world blurs into a kaleidoscope of colors, you wake up in your bed, the dream fading like mist, leaving you with a lingering question: What was that meeting really about?
