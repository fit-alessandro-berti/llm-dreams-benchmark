You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air, previously thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, is now charged with a strange, metallic tang.  A low, guttural growl, deeper than any animal's, vibrates through the earth.  Twisted, gnarled trees begin to thrash violently, their branches lashing out like skeletal fingers.  The sun, which had been a warm, golden disc, disappears behind a curtain of swirling, inky clouds.

The ground beneath your feet starts to tremble.  Not a gentle tremor, but a shuddering, heaving pulse that feels as though the forest itself is trying to heave itself out of the earth.  You stumble, your foot catching on a root that feels impossibly large, almost sentient.  Looking up, you see the canopy above you is not just churning with wind, but with something else – a myriad of tiny, glowing eyes, bathing the forest in an unsettling, emerald green light.

The growl intensifies, becoming a deafening roar that seems to be tearing through the very fabric of reality.  A flash of lightning, brighter than any you've ever seen, illuminates the forest floor.  And as it does, you see it.  Not a creature, not a tree, but a massive, obsidian serpent, coiled around the base of a colossal redwood. Its scales shimmer with an inner fire, and its eyes burn with a cold, incandescent light.  As the serpent slowly uncoils, its body emitting a low, humming sound, you realize it isn't made of flesh and blood, but of solidified shadow.  The very air around it seems to crackle with power.

Terror, raw and visceral, grips you.  But in the midst of the storm, a faint melody, almost a whisper, seems to emanate from within the serpent's coils.  It's a song of ancient wisdom, of forgotten lore, weaving through the screams of the wind and the roar of the storm.  And as you stare at the creature, a profound, unsettling peace washes over you.  You feel a connection, a profound understanding of something beyond your comprehension. The storm rages on, but you are no longer afraid.  You are drawn towards the serpent, towards the heart of the tempest, towards the unknowable.
