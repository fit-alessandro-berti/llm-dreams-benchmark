In the dream, your fingers trace the intricate patterns on the box—swirling vines, celestial constellations, and ancient runes that seem to shimmer under an unseen light. As you press a crescent moon symbol, the patterns rearrange like living ink, forming a riddle etched in silver:  

> *"I speak without a mouth, flow without life,  
> Unlock the silent door where memories are rife.  
> What is lost in shadow, found in light,  
> And carried through the watchful night?"*  

You whisper, "A dream."  

The box clicks softly. The lid lifts, revealing not a key, but a pool of liquid starlight. Reaching in, your hand emerges holding a mirror—but it reflects not your face, but a memory: you as a child, burying a seashell beneath an oak tree at twilight. The image shifts, showing the same tree now, moonlight illuminating a faint mound at its roots...  

Suddenly, you wake—heart pounding—with the taste of salt air on your lips and wet sand between your fingers. On your bedside table, a real seashell rests where none had been before. The dream-box’s mystery had woven itself into waking life, gifting you a forgotten fragment of your past.  

The box remains unopened in the dream’s echo, but its true treasure was never inside it—it was the journey back to yourself.
