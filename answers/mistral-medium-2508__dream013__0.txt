the puzzles grow increasingly surreal, blurring the line between logic and the subconscious. The walls of the maze shift subtly when you aren’t looking—sometimes made of cold stone, other times of living vines that whisper secrets in a language you almost understand. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency, like the vibration of a tuning fork pressed against your ribs.

Ahead, you reach a chamber where the floor is a vast, circular chessboard, but the pieces are alive. The white queen is a woman with a face like cracked porcelain, her fingers elongating into sharp, ink-stained quills as she gestures to the board. *"Solve the gambit,"* she murmurs, *"or the doors stay sealed."* The black king is a shadow with too many eyes, watching as the pawns—small, childlike figures with hollow eyes—begin to move on their own, rearranging the board into an impossible configuration. The rules aren’t standard; the pieces don’t just capture, they *consume*, dissolving into the squares with a sound like crumpling paper.

You realize the puzzle isn’t about winning, but about *sacrifice*. The queen’s voice slithers into your mind: *"What will you surrender to proceed?"* The options appear as floating symbols:
- **A memory** (one you haven’t thought of in years, now vivid as a wound).
- **A sense** (your vision narrows to a tunnel, or your hands go numb).
- **A name** (your own, or someone else’s—spoken aloud, it might unravel you).

As you hesitate, the maze *breathes*. The walls pulse inward, then out, like lungs. Behind you, the path you took has vanished, replaced by a mirror showing a version of yourself who’s already made a choice—their face half-erased, like a sketch smudged by a careless hand.

Deeper in, the puzzles stop being puzzles and start being *tests of identity*. A door shaped like a mouth asks, *"What is the lie you tell yourself most often?"* The lock only opens if you answer honestly—but the moment you do, the door *laughs*, and the corridor beyond stretches into a void where your reflection walks ahead of you, always just out of reach.

Then, at the heart of the maze, you find a table. On it sits a single object: a **key made of glass**, filled with swirling mist. Beside it, a note in your own handwriting reads:
*"You were never lost. You were being unwound."*

The moment you touch the key, the maze *inverts*. The walls peel back like skin, revealing not a labyrinth, but a vast, star-strewn sky—and below you, the puzzle wasn’t the maze at all. It was *you*, asleep on a bed of roots, your chest rising and falling as the key dissolves into your palm.

You wake up.
(Or do you?)
