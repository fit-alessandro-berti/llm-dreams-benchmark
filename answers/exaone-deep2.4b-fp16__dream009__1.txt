As you venture deeper into the forest, your eyes land on a faint mist that hints at underground sources. Your ancestors spoke of a hidden spring that fueled the village’s rivers for centuries, but its location lost to time. Remember a legend about the spring’s entrance: it lies between a towering oak and a jagged rocky outcrook. You must crossing this treacherous path to uncover its secrets before the spring dries, leaving the village submerged. The challenge is to navigate the chasm-like terrain, retrieve ancient tools to narrow the gap, and redirect enough water flow—all while anchoring your resolve to honor your family’s wisdom. The fate of your village hangs in the balance.
