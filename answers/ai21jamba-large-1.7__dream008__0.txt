feel a knot in your stomach as you glance at the mountain of work ahead. Your coworkers are nowhere to be seen—they're either out for lunch or buried in their own tasks. The clock on the wall seems to be ticking louder with every passing second, its rhythmic sound both a reminder and a torment.

You sit at your desk, staring at the project outline, but the words blur together as your mind races with questions. How will I finish this in time? What if I fail? Your boss walks over, their expression impossible to read, and asks, "How's it going?" A bead of sweat trickles down your temple as you scramble for an answer.
