The strangers don't just point you toward a map—they *become* the map. One taps a rhythm on the damp pavement, and suddenly, glowing blue footprints materialize in the rain-slicked cracks, pulsing like bioluminescent sea glass. Another hums a melody, and the towering skyscrapers bend inward, their windows shifting into archways lined with hanging gardens of jasmine and paper lanterns. The city breathes with you.

You follow the footprints, not walking but *floating* just above the ground, as if carried by the hum in the air. The strangers walk beside you, not speaking, but their hands brush yours—not skin on skin, but the gentle pressure of warm sunlight through fog. One presses a sprig of silver fern into your palm; it dissolves into starlight the moment you close your fingers.

You turn a corner where neon signs melt into constellations, and there—*your street*. But it’s not your street. It’s a single-story cottage with a wraparound porch, smoke curling from its chimney like a question mark. The kind strangers stop. The tallest one (wearing a coat made of woven shadows) smiles, revealing teeth like moonstones. "You were never lost," they whisper, their voice the sound of pages turning. "You were remembering how to be found."

They don’t vanish. They *unfold*. One becomes the willow tree by the porch, another the teacup steaming on the railing, a third the key now warm in your hand. The city’s roar fades into birdsong. You step onto the porch, and the door opens—not to a room, but to a quiet morning in your childhood kitchen. Sunlight spills across the floor. On the table: a half-finished drawing of this very city, sketched in crayon by your younger self.

You wake not with a gasp, but with tears drying on your cheeks like salt from an ocean you’ve never visited—yet somehow know by heart. The dream leaves you with three things:  
✨ The scent of jasmine clinging to your pillow  
✨ A silver fern petal caught in your hair (impossible, but real)  
✨ The certainty that kindness isn’t given—it’s *recognized*, like meeting an old friend in a stranger’s eyes.  

You’ll never find that city on a map. But you’ll spend years learning to fold your own hands into bridges.  

*(The dream doesn’t end. It just lets you go.)*
