You are participating in a competition where the grand prize is your dream job. As the competition progresses, you face various challenges—puzzles that unfold like origami, logic gates built from memory fragments, and a final stage where time flows backward.

Then, in the penultimate round, you’re led into a vast, silent observatory—a cathedral of brass telescopes and whirring clockwork stars. A voice—neither human nor machine—echoes from the dome:  
> *"To earn your dream, you must not chase it. You must become it."*

Before you stands three doors—none labeled. The first glows with golden light and displays a thousand job listings, each scrolling with your name. The second is cold obsidian, etched with your past failures. The third is simple, unvarnished wood, carved with the words: *What do you truly build?*

You pause. The pressure is immense—this is it. Your future hovers on a thread of choice.

Then, unexpectedly, your phone vibrates in your pocket. Not a ring—just a soft pulse. You frown. You *never* bring your phone into dreams. But you reach in… and pull out not your phone, but a small, hand-drawn map—your childhood sketch of the treehouse you never built with your older sister, who passed away last year.

The voice murmurs:  
> *"The dream you seek isn’t waiting beyond the doors. It’s the one you’ve already carried in your hands all along."*

You take a breath—and choose the wooden door.

It opens not onto a boardroom or studio, but onto a sunlit meadow where a half-finished treehouse waits, surrounded by tools, sawdust, and two sets of footprints in the soft earth.

And standing there, holding a wrench in one hand and a half-assembled birdhouse in the other, is your sister, smiling—not older, not younger—just *her*.

She says softly, “Took you long enough to knock.”

And you realize—you’re not competing anymore.

You’re home.

*(The dream ends not with a醒, but with the sound of hammer strikes, birdsong, and the quiet certainty that the job was never the prize. The dream was the reason.)*
