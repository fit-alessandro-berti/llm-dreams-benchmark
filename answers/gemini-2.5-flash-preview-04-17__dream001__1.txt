Okay, here we go...

You are dreaming.

You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to **panic, a cold knot tightening in your stomach. The buildings here are unlike anything you've ever seen – they twist towards the sky in impossible angles, some shimmering with an inner light, others appearing solid and ancient, carved from materials you don't recognize. The streets are a confusing maze of narrow alleyways and wide, empty boulevards where strange, silent vehicles glide past.**

**You look around frantically for a street sign, a landmark, anything familiar. But the signs are in a language you don't understand, or they display symbols that shift and reform before your eyes. The people you see are few and far between, their faces indistinct or averted, and when you try to ask for directions, they either don't hear you, pass through you like mist, or offer cryptic answers that make no sense ("Follow the echo of the forgotten key," one whispers, dissolving into the wall).**

**The feeling of urgency intensifies. You try to run, but the ground seems to pull at your feet, making your movements slow and heavy, like wading through thick honey. The city air tastes of ozone and something sweet and unsettling. You check your wrist for the time, but your watch face is blank, reflecting only your own wide, anxious eyes. Yet, you *know* the hour is slipping away with terrifying speed.**

**You turn down what looks like a main thoroughfare, hoping to find a map or a public transport system, but the street abruptly ends in a sheer cliff face that wasn't there a moment ago. Turning back, the path you came from has vanished, replaced by a rippling, watery surface where buildings should be.**

**A low, resonant hum starts to vibrate through the soles of your feet, growing louder. It feels like the city itself is alive, aware of your confusion, maybe even enjoying it. You spot a glowing doorway in the side of what looked like a solid rock face – it wasn't there a second ago. Drawn by a desperate, irrational hope, or perhaps just the need for *any* change of scenery, you stumble towards it as the hum reaches a crescendo.**

**Stepping through is like entering a different dimension. The city is gone. You are in a vast, quiet space filled with soft, shifting light and the faint scent of rain. Before you lies a colossal, intricate clockwork mechanism, its gears turning silently, reaching into the hazy distance. And nestled within the central gears, shimmering faintly, is a single, ordinary-looking wristwatch. It ticks with perfect, unnerving precision, showing 59 minutes past the hour.**

**Your meeting... it was a moment ago. Or is it still an hour away? The dream logic falters, leaving you standing alone with the silent, immense clockwork and the impossible feeling of lost time.**
