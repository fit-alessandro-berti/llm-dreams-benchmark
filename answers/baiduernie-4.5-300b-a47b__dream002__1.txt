Here’s a vivid continuation of your dream:

---

You are walking through a peaceful forest, sunlight dappling the mossy ground and birdsong humming in the air. The tranquility is shattered as the sky darkens suddenly, thunder growling low in the distance. A harsh wind tears through the trees, whipping your clothes and rustling leaves into a frenzy. The air hums with an eerie, electric charge. 

You dash for shelter, but the forest itself seems to shift. Trees bend like skeletal hands, roots coil into serpentine shapes, and the path vanishes beneath your feet. Rain lashes down, sharp as needles, and the wind carries whispers in a language you don’t recognize. A figure emerges from the gloom—a towering, shadowed form with glowing eyes, its form flickering between humanoid and beastly. It beckons, but you recoil. 

The ground trembles, splitting open to reveal a swirling void beneath. You scramble backward, only to find your hands sinking into the bark of a tree as if it’s liquid. Roots grip your ankles, pulling you toward the dark fissure. Lightning cracks overhead, illuminating ancient symbols carved into nearby stones, pulsing with an otherworldly light. 

Just as despair takes hold, a faint melody drifts through the chaos—a lullaby sung in a voice both familiar and alien. The storm stalls, freezing mid-roar. The shadowed figure tilts its head, as if listening. With a final, mournful note, the song unravels the darkness. The trees straighten, the sky clears, and the forest breathes a sigh of relief. 

You awaken lying on soft grass, the sun warm on your face. The storm is gone, but in your palm lies a single obsidian feather, glistening with droplets of rain that never touched the ground.
