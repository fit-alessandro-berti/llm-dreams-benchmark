…written in a language you somehow recognize but have never studied, its characters glimmering like fish scales in shallow water. When you glance closer, the ink ripples and reorders itself into memories you didn’t know you owned—your grandmother’s kitchen window, the smell of lilacs and graphite, the first time you lied and got away with it. Each question is a door. Each door breathes.

You pick up your pen and it hums, heavy as a tuning fork. The proctor at the front of the room is an owl wearing a wristwatch, tapping its face with a feather. “Begin,” it hoots, but the word arrives as a snowfall, soft and inevitable.

Question one: “In what season did you stop being the person you promised yourself you would be?” There are multiple choices, but they are all someone’s names. You circle one and the room tilts slightly, like a boat turning toward the wind. The classmates around you are strangers with your friends’ eyes, flipping pages that flutter like moths.

Question two: “Define velocity without using time.” You draw a picture of a child running toward a dog that already loves her. The ink smiles.

The third page smells like rain. It asks, “How do you carry the weight that’s made of nothing?” You try lifting the paper and your arms fill with that bright, trembling ache you get when a song almost tells you what it means. Somewhere behind you, a clock coughs.

You look up to ask a question, but the room has grown a second horizon. The back wall is now a coastline, and surf gathers around the legs of the desks. The owl-proctor clicks its watch open; inside is your reflection, adjusting a tie you’ve never owned. “No talking,” it says, as if you had.

A rustle. The class is turning their exams over, and on the reverse side is a map of the building that wasn’t there when you came in. An arrow reads YOU ARE STILL ARRIVING. Halls fold into halls. A stairway doubles back into the seat you’re in, and you realize the test is not a set of questions but an itinerary.

You follow it without standing. You remember how to walk by breathing differently. Desk after desk becomes crosswalks; fluorescent lights rearrange themselves into constellations you can read only when you forget their names.

Question four: “Demonstrate stability while in free fall.” You unclench. The chair lets go of you kindly. The floor becomes a sky and your pencil, a small weather vane. You are falling the correct way, the way a leaf chooses to narrate gravity. Applause comes from the corners, shy and small, like rain starting.

When you land, you’re in a library where all the books have been checked out by versions of you who studied more diligently, who asked better questions, who slept. On your desk is a single volume you’ve never seen: Syllabus of Remembered Futures. The cover is warm. Inside is the final question.

“Write the career you are afraid you want.”

You hesitate, because the word is a bird and also a key, and because the owl has stopped pretending it isn’t watching you. Your pen blots. You write it anyway—crooked at first, then not. Letters stacking like stones across a stream. As soon as you finish, the page exhales, and the ink, delighted, becomes a small door. You press your hand to it and feel the temperature of a place where you are already working, already tired, already happy.

“Time,” hoots the watch.

You look around. The surf has receded. Your classmates are plants in various stages of bloom. The owl stamps your paper with a crescent moon that dries into a smile.

You stand to turn in your exam and discover you’ve been barefoot the entire time, your feet dusted with chalk stars. As you walk to the front, the floor becomes the hill outside your childhood home. Grass leans toward your ankles. The proctor opens its beak and releases a note that sounds exactly like late afternoon in June.

“Results will arrive yesterday,” it says.

You nod, relieved, because that’s plenty of time. You step through the door your answer became, and for an instant you’re both outside it and inside it, failing and passing, a corridor and a compass. Then the bell rings, and you wake with the taste of lilacs and graphite, and a word still fluttering in your mouth like a small, bright bird that knows the way.
