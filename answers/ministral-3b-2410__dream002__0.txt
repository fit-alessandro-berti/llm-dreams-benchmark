You quickly seek shelter under the nearest tree, but as you look up, you realize it's not just any tree. It's an ancient, wise-looking tree with a face etched into its bark. The tree speaks to you in a deep, resonating voice, "Greetings, traveler. I have been waiting for you. The storm signifies a change, one that will come soon. Will you accept it?"

You hesitate, feeling a mix of fear and curiosity. The tree nods understandingly, "There is no time to waste. The storm is here now. Choose, traveler. Will you face it alone, or will you embrace it together?"

You take a deep breath, knowing that this decision could change your path forever. What do you choose to do?
