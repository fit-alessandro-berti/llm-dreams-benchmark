…raise your hand, but instead of shouting orders, your voice turns into a low, steady bell that rings across the waves. The crew straightens, and the rigging begins to hum like strings on a vast instrument. The storm seems to listen. Lightning fractures the sky, and for a moment the ocean is glass, reflecting not your ship but a city of lights beneath the surface, drifting just out of reach.

A compass appears in your palm, warm and pulsing like a heartbeat. Its needle spins, then points not north but inward, and you suddenly remember a door on the deck that you never knew existed. You open it and find a staircase spiraling down into the ship's hull, but with each step the sea grows quieter, and the storm recedes above you like a curtain. At the bottom is a small room with a single candle and a map of the sky spread out on the table.

You glance back up. The crew is still watching, but their faces are those of people you once knew. You smile, and with a single breath, the candle’s flame turns into a sunrise. The sea calms, the ship sails into the light, and you wake with the sound of waves fading into the rhythm of your own breathing.
