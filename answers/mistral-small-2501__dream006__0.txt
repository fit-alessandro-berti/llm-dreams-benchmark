As I step onto the stage, the bright lights momentarily blind me, and a wave of adrenaline surges through my body. The auditorium is vast, filled with hundreds of faces, all turned up towards me, waiting for me to speak. I take a deep breath, trying to calm my nerves, and walk confidently towards the podium.

I glance down at my notes, but the words on the paper seem to blur. Suddenly, the audience starts to murmur, their faces beginning to transform. Some of them have animal features – a person with the ears of a fox, another with the beak of an eagle. The murmur grows louder, and I feel a strange sensation creep up my spine.

I try to start my speech, but my voice falters. The room is whirling now, and the faces in the crowd are shifting rapidly. A woman with the scales of a snake catches my eye and smiles, her eyes cold and piercing. A man with the antlers of a deer stands up and starts clapping, his hooves clicking against the floor. The clapping spreads to the rest of the audience, but the sound is uneven and eerie, like the clacking of tusks and the flapping of wings.

I try to regain control, to start my speech, but my words come out jumbled and nonsensical. The audience is laughing now, a chilling sound that echoes through the auditorium. I feel a cold sweat break out on my forehead, and I clutch the podium for support.

Suddenly, the stage beneath me starts to shake, and the floorboards begin to split. Roots and vines burst through the cracks, reaching out towards me. I stumble back, but the vines wrap around my ankles, holding me in place. The audience is now a wild, chaotic scene, with creatures of all kinds howling and screaming.

I close my eyes tightly, and when I open them again, everything is still. The audience is back to normal, their faces expectant and kind. The vines and roots have disappeared, and the stage is solid beneath me. I take a deep breath, steady myself, and begin my speech again, this time with a clear voice and a calm demeanor.

As I speak, the audience listens intently, their faces a sea of nods and smiles. The speech flows effortlessly, and I feel a sense of relief and accomplishment wash over me. The dream shifts smoothly, and I find myself walking off the stage to thunderous applause, feeling like I've truly connected with the audience.
