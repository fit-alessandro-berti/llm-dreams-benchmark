They are laughing and trying to figure out how to slice it so that everyone gets an equal piece with the same amount of frosting. You politely decline their offer to join in and continue your search.

Next, you come across a group sitting in a circle on the floor, playing an intense game of "Two Truths and a Lie." They beckon you to join, but you explain that you're looking for someone and carry on.
