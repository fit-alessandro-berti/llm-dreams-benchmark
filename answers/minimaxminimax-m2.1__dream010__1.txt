# The Final Round

You find yourself standing in an enormous auditorium, the kind with velvet seats that stretch up into infinite darkness overhead. Spotlights beam down from unseen heights, illuminating a stage where three imposing figures sit behind a gleaming obsidian table. Your heart pounds against your ribs as you realize you've made it further than you ever imagined.

The challenges so far have been a blur of surreal tests—negotiating with animatronic robots about abstract concepts, solving puzzles that rearranged themselves when you weren't looking, and delivering an impromptu speech to an audience of your own reflection. Each obstacle felt impossible in the moment, yet somehow you found your way through.

"Now," announces the central figure, her voice echoing with an otherworldly resonance, "we present your final challenge."

The floor beneath you shifts, and suddenly you're no longer in the auditorium but standing in a cluttered office that looks exactly like the workspace you've always imagined for yourself. Sunlight streams through floor-to-ceiling windows, casting golden rectangles across mahogany desks stacked with books and half-finished projects. A computer hums softly, its screen glowing with possibilities.

"In this room," the voice continues, seemingly coming from everywhere and nowhere, "you will find everything you need to do the job you've always wanted. The question is: do you already possess the skills to do it, or have you been dreaming of something you aren't truly capable of achieving?"

You look around and notice the files on the desk, the phone with its blinking lights, the unfinished reports, the calendar full of meetings. The room feels both foreign and familiar, like a place you've visited a thousand times in your imagination but never truly inhabited.

As you approach the desk, you realize with a start that your hands are already moving—reaching for a pen, flipping open a folder, your eyes scanning documents as though you've read them a thousand times before. The work feels natural, intuitive, as if your hands remember what your conscious mind has yet to learn.

The dream is still unfolding, the final challenge waiting to reveal its true nature. What will you discover about yourself when you finally sit down and begin?
