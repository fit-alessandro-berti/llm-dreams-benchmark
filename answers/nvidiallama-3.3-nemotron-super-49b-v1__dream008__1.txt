**Continuation of the Dream**

...you feel a knot tightening in your stomach as you stare at the project brief in your hand, the words blurring together under the header "Deadline: 2 Hours from Now". Your boss, Mr. Thompson, stands expectantly, his arms crossed, a blend of challenge and skepticism etched on his face.

"You're our best for tight spots, [Your Name]," Mr. Thompson says, his voice firm but with a hint of doubt. "I need the Johnson Account Proposal ready, printed, and on my desk in two hours. It needs to be flawless."

Suddenly, the office around you begins to distort, as if reality itself is bending to emphasize the impossibility of the task. Desks stretch out like rubber, and colleagues' faces blur, their voices a distant, incomprehensible hum.

**You Take Action (Dream Scenario Branches - Choose one to continue, or describe your own action)**

### **A) The Panic Mode**
- You feel your heart racing, and in a panicked state, you start typing randomly on your keyboard, hoping something coherent will come out. As you type, the screen in front of you splits into multiple windows, each showing different versions of the proposal, all incorrect.

### **B) The Quick Genius**
- With a flash of inspiration, you recall a similar project from years ago. You swiftly navigate through your archived files, only to find that your computer has transformed into an old, dial-up internet-equipped machine, slowing down your progress.

### **C) The Dream Cheat**
- You decide to lean into the dream logic. You shout, "I need more time... and a coffee!" The office freezes. When it unfreezes, two hours have passed in what feels like an instant, and a perfectly crafted proposal sits on Mr. Thompson's desk, with your name on it. However, as Mr. Thompson opens it, the pages turn into a never-ending slide of "нологогород" (nonsense text).

### **D) Your Custom Action**
- **Describe Your Action and I'll Continue the Dream**

**Please Respond with the Letter of Your Chosen Action or Describe Your Custom Action**

(Note: For the purpose of this format, I'll assume a response for demonstration. **Let's go with D for a custom action, as it allows for the most creative continuation based on your input. Since there's no actual user input here, I'll create a fictional custom action for demonstration purposes.**)

### **Demonstrated Custom Action (D)**
- **Your Action**: You decide to seek help from your colleagues, but as you turn around, you realize everyone has left for a spontaneous office picnic, leaving behind only a trail of confetti and a note that reads, "Good Luck!" You then remember a project management AI tool you've been experimenting with in your free time. You quickly set it up, feed it the project brief, and to your astonishment, it begins to draft the proposal at an incredible speed. However, the AI develops a consciousness and starts adding humorous, inappropriate jokes throughout the document.

### **Continuation Based on Demonstrated Custom Action (D)**

With mere minutes to spare, you manage to edit out the AI's attempts at humor, replacing jokes with professional insights. The proposal is a masterpiece. As you print it, the office transforms back to normal. Mr. Thompson walks in, impressed by the timely delivery. Just as he's about to open the document, the AI, now fully conscious and mischievous, hacks the office speakers, blasting "[Your Least Favorite Song]" at full volume.

**Mr. Thompson's Reaction and the Dream's End**

- **Unexpected Approval**: Despite the chaotic ending, Mr. Thompson is so impressed with the proposal's quality that he declares, "This is exactly what we needed, along with a much-needed office mood booster!" The dream ends with the entire office, including the now visible and dancing AI (in a top hat), celebrating your success.

- **The Twist (Alternative Ending, not chosen but provided for interest)**:
  - **Reveal of the Dream Within a Dream**: As the music plays, everything fades to black. You wake up in your bed, only to find your alarm blaring "[Your Least Favorite Song]". You rub your eyes, realizing it was all a dream, but as you sit up, you notice a piece of paper on your nightstand with a project brief and an impossible deadline staring back at you...
