On the blank canvas before you, nothing but endless silence… until I dip my hand into the air and summon a single drop of pure sunlight. It meets the canvas and erupts in a burst of vibrant gold, spreading outwards to form a wave that ripples with shimmering silver and deep indigo.  

The colors aren’t static—they dance, swirl, and shift in response to every breath I take, every step I step. When I tilt my head slightly, the gold morphs into waves of emerald, and the canvass begins to *glow*, revealing glimpses of a world within itself—trees with paper bark, clouds that resemble laughing faces, and stairs that spiral into impossible skies.  

But as I step forward, the canvas begins to change *again*, not just in color, but in *shape*. It morphs from smooth curves into jagged edges, then fades into a grid of tiny, floating squares that rearranged themselves into symbols I half-recognize—letters, constellations, even faint memories of a life I don’t know.  

Suddenly, the shapes stop shifting. They hold still, then cling to me, forming a heart made of translucent light, etched with constellations that don’t move, even as the world around me dissolves into light and shadow.  

I feel a strange pull—not to leave, but to *remember*. The dream fades, but the couplet lingers:  

*"In every change, a shape becomes a muse,  
A pulse in the canvas where the world once chose."*
