You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air thickens with an electric hum, like the whisper of forgotten secrets. The leaves above rustle not with wind, but with the soft glow of fireflies that weren't there moments ago, their lights pulsing in rhythm with your heartbeat.

You quicken your pace, branches brushing your skin like curious fingers, but the path ahead twists into a labyrinth of glowing mushrooms that sprout from the earth, forming an archway that beckons you forward. Thunder rumbles, not from the sky, but from deep within the trees themselves—ancient oaks groaning as if awakening from slumber. Rain begins to fall, but it's no ordinary downpour; the drops shimmer like liquid starlight, warming your face and dissolving the boundaries between you and the forest.

As the storm peaks, you stumble into a clearing where the eye of the tempest swirls—a massive, iridescent whirlpool suspended in the air, pulling in leaves, petals, and fragments of your own memories. You reach out, and time folds: childhood laughter echoes from the vortex, mingled with the scent of your grandmother's garden. The storm isn't destroying; it's revealing. In its heart, you see yourself, not as you are, but as you could be—wild, unbound, woven into the fabric of the world.

Then, as suddenly as it began, the whirlpool stills. The rain fades to a gentle mist, and the forest sighs in contentment. You awaken, the dream's glow lingering on your skin like dew, wondering if the storm was ever outside you at all.
