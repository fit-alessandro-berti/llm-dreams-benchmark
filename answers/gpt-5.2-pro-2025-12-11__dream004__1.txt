…you come across a blank canvas and it’s the only thing that isn’t shifting. It sits upright in the middle of a field of soft geometry—cubes breathing into spheres, triangles folding into birds—while the sky keeps trying on new palettes like outfits.

You step closer. The canvas is so white it feels loud.

When you lift your hand to touch it, the air thickens, as if the world is holding its breath. Your fingertip hovers a hair’s width from the surface and a thin line appears anyway—ink without ink, a mark made by intention rather than contact. It’s the color of a memory you can’t place.

The landscape reacts.

Behind you, the ground’s tessellations pause mid-metamorphosis, like dancers caught mid-step. A nearby tree of glass leaves stops shimmering and turns its attention toward the canvas. Even the wind waits, as though the act of drawing has become a new law.

You try another line. It curves, then changes its mind, then becomes a doorway.

The canvas is no longer a flat object. It is depth pretending to be flat.

You lean in and the smell of paint hits you—oil and rain and something metallic—so vivid it makes your eyes water. The doorway you drew opens into a corridor of unfinished images: half-born suns, faces with no mouths, cities that are only their shadows. They drift inside the canvas like fish in a pale aquarium, bumping gently against the edges, wanting out.

A soft voice—not from anywhere, but from the space behind your ribs—says: *Pick one. Give it gravity.*

You look back at the world around you: the constant transformation, the beautiful instability. It has no anchor, no decision, no “this is what I am.” For the first time, it seems tired. As if it has been changing for so long it’s forgotten how to arrive.

You glance down and realize you’re holding a brush you don’t remember finding. Its bristles are made of fine threads of light. The handle is warm, like it’s been held by someone else just a second ago.

You paint a small circle near the center of the canvas. It’s not perfect. It wobbles. Immediately the circle becomes a moon, and the sky in the real world obediently darkens to make room for it. A night appears the way a gasp appears—sudden, involuntary.

The shifting shapes around you slow. Colors begin to settle into relationships: blues choosing their adjacent greens, reds deciding where they belong. The world is no longer trying on everything at once; it’s listening.

You paint a horizon line. The ground, relieved, stretches into distance. You paint a single doorway on that horizon and somewhere in the landscape a real door materializes, standing alone, painted the exact shade you used—an impossible shade that feels like home and loss at the same time.

As you keep painting, you notice you aren’t inventing things so much as remembering them. A childhood room you forgot you ever had. A staircase that only exists in one particular dream. A face you recognize without being able to name. Each time you add a detail, the world echoes it in three dimensions, as though the canvas is the blueprint and reality is the obedient copy.

Then you hesitate.

Because every mark you make reduces the infinite possibilities. Every choice is a closing of doors as much as an opening. You feel it: the tension between freedom and form, between endless change and a place to stand.

The soft voice returns: *If you stop, it goes back to noise. If you finish, it becomes a story.*

You look at the blank spaces left on the canvas. They aren’t empty; they’re waiting.

So instead of painting a whole scene, you paint one thing you can’t explain: a small, simple shape—an unremarkable oval—floating near the bottom edge. You paint it carefully, as if it matters more than mountains.

The moment you do, the oval lifts off the canvas and hovers in front of you in real space. It hums. It’s not an object; it’s a feeling given outline. It’s the missing piece the world has been searching for, the reason all the shapes were changing: to find a form that fits that feeling.

The landscape exhales.

Everything stops shifting—not permanently, but peacefully, like a child finally falling asleep. Colors settle into a dawn that doesn’t hurt your eyes. The air becomes breathable. The trees and rivers and impossible architecture hold still long enough for you to truly see them.

The blank canvas is no longer blank. It’s sparse, but complete. A horizon. A moon. A door. A floating oval that refuses to be named.

You step back, and the painting steps back too—into itself—becoming flat again, content to be an image rather than a portal.

As you turn to leave, you notice something on the very bottom corner of the canvas, written in tiny letters you didn’t write:

*Thank you for choosing.*

You walk toward the lone door on the horizon. With each step, the ground is steadier, less uncertain. When you reach the door, it opens on its own.

On the other side is another room—quiet, ordinary, dimly lit. There is a bed. There is a window. Outside the window, the sky is the same dawn you painted.

You glance back once, expecting the surreal world to be gone, but it isn’t. It’s folded itself neatly into the painting, waiting—still alive in its stillness.

Then you step through.

The door clicks shut behind you with the soft finality of waking up, and for a moment you can still feel the brush in your hand, warm as a pulse, before it becomes your own hand on a sheet, or a pillow, or nothing at all.

And just before you fully wake, you realize the strangest part:

The canvas wasn’t something you found.

It was something you carried.
