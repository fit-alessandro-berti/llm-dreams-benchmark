…grip the wheel tighter, the wood slick beneath your hands as rain lashes against your face. The wind howls like some ancient beast, and the ship groans under the strain of each towering wave. Lightning tears the sky in jagged patterns, briefly illuminating the white-eyed fear on the faces of your crew.  

You shout orders above the roar of the storm, your voice steady despite the chaos. “Reef the mainsail! Keep her bow into the swell!” Your crew scrambles to obey, silhouettes darting through sheets of water.  

But then—something strange happens.  

Out on the horizon, through a break in the darkness, you see it: a ghostly light, pale and steady, hovering above the water. It’s unlike the erratic flashes of lightning—calm, almost beckoning. And with it comes a sound, low and melodic, threading itself through the thunder.  

Your pulse quickens, and the air feels suddenly charged, heavy, as though the storm itself is holding its breath. You hear footsteps behind you—someone from the crew, perhaps—but when you turn, there’s no one there. Only the empty, glistening deck.  

The wind shifts abruptly, carrying that haunting melody closer, and you realize—it isn’t in the air. It’s inside your head.  

What do you do?
