Panic subsides as you remember your trusty smartphone in your pocket. Pulling it out, you attempt to call someone for directions but there's no service. Instead, you rely on a mystical, ancient map that materializes from the depths of your dream. 

The parchment unfurls itself revealing a complex network of streets and buildings alien yet oddly familiar in a way only dreams can convey. No landmarks are legible, but an eerie glow marks your starting point. 

With a sense of purpose, you begin to traverse the cityscape, each step translating into reality as the unknown metropolis slowly forms around you. The buildings shift from modern skyscrapers to classical architecture, to futuristic domes, and back again, in a surreal tapestry of urban designs. 

You pass through bustling markets where vendors sell items of every description - from exotic fruits that glow with inner light to tiny robots huddled together like swarms of insects. Children play with phantasmagorical toys, their laughter a comforting hum in the background. 

As you navigate, the dream city starts to feel less foreign and more welcoming. You marvel at the audacity of its design, the vibrancy of its inhabitants. Yet, the meeting looms, and as you approach your destination - a colossal library with a grand clock tower counting down the minutes - anxiety kicks back in. 

But wait! Just before entering, a wise old woman, part human and part book, appears out of thin air. She hands you a scroll with directions written in symbols you intuitively understand. It leads you through a series of winding alleyways to a nondescript door at the back of the library. 

You knock and it swings open into a vast room filled with scholars conversing in hushed tones while interactive holographic displays hum softly around them. In the center, a single seat awaits you - your meeting has begun. 

Despite the dreamlike circumstances, an unspoken rule of order prevails, and you partake in a discussion as profound as it is peculiar. The discourse about matters cosmic and mundane, realities yet to exist, paradoxes solved through philosophical dissection. 

When the meeting concludes an hour later, the same old woman appears, providing you another enchanted scroll this time leading back home - a reverse route that would astound any waking navigator. As you follow it, the dream world begins to fray at its edges, the city fading away as dawn's light seeps into your bedroom, signaling the end of your extraordinary nocturnal voyage.
