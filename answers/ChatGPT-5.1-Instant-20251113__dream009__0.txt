…figure out how to survive—and blend in.

At first, everything feels strangely quiet. No hum of electricity, no traffic, no screens glowing in the darkness. Morning light slips through a wooden shutter, and as you step outside, the air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth. People in simple clothes move about, carrying baskets, tending to animals, speaking in accents and dialects you’ve only ever heard in period dramas.

You wander through the village, doing your best not to stare. A pair of children run past, chasing a hoop. A blacksmith hammers iron in rhythmic bursts. You catch your reflection in a metal basin—your modern clothes make you stand out like a flare in the night.

That’s when it hits you:
You need to *blend in* or risk drawing unwanted attention in a time where strangers—and strange behavior—are often met with suspicion.

You spot a line of laundry strung between two cottages, and among the tunics and cloaks, a plain linen shirt that might pass for the local style. You consider your options… but before you act, the ground trembles slightly beneath your feet. A moment later, a distant horn blares—deep, long, and unmistakably urgent.

Villagers drop what they’re doing. Doors slam. Animals bray nervously.

Someone grabs your arm.
“You!” a woman hisses. “Get inside. They’re coming.”

You open your mouth to ask who, but she pulls you through a doorway before you can speak. Her home is small, lit by a single oil lamp. She pushes a cloak into your hands.

“Put this on,” she whispers. “If they see you dressed like *that*, they’ll think you’re one of them.”

“One of who?” you manage to ask.

Her eyes flick toward the shuttered window.
“The ones from the sky.”

Silence hangs heavy around you. Outside, the horn sounds again.

And you realize this “different era” may not be as simple—or as ancient—as it seems.
