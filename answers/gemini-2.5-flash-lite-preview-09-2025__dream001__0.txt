You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to **run, the cobblestones slick under your feet, each tall, angular building looking exactly like the last, yet subtly different.**

The air is thick with the scent of ozone and something faintly metallic, like old pennies. The sky isn't blue; it's a deep, luminous indigo, and instead of the sun, there's a colossal, slow-spinning geometric shape that casts shadows that move backward.

Panic begins to tighten your chest. You stop to ask a passerby—a figure draped entirely in shimmering, liquid silver—for directions to the 'Central Nexus Tower.'

The silver figure doesn't have a head, but a small, perfect sphere of emerald light hovers where the face should be. It doesn't speak. Instead, the air around you hums, and a sound, like the collective sigh of a thousand libraries closing at once, echoes in your mind. The message is clear, though nonsensical: **"The Nexus moves with the meridian's echo, seek the sound of the silent bell."**

Frustrated, you check your wrist. You aren't wearing a watch, but a band of smooth, warm obsidian. As you look at it, the obsidian begins to pulse with a dim internal light, displaying a single, shifting glyph that you somehow *know* is the correct time: **"37 minutes remaining."**

You notice the architecture isn't stone; it's woven. The buildings are intricate lattices of petrified, glowing moss, connected by bridges made of solidified mist. You realize that you aren't running *through* the city; you are running *around* a massive, unseen central point.

Suddenly, you hear it—the "silent bell." It isn't auditory; it's a vibration that resonates deep in your bones, a feeling of inevitable resonance. Following this feeling, you duck down an alleyway that smells sharply of cinnamon and ozone.

The alley opens onto a vast, open plaza. In the center stands a fountain, but instead of water, it spouts thin, vertical streams of pure, slow-motion light that solidify just before they hit the basin, creating ephemeral, glittering sculptures that instantly crumble back into light.

And there, standing by the fountain, waiting patiently as if they've been there for centuries, are the attendees of your meeting. They aren't human. One is a towering figure composed entirely of spinning clockwork gears that occasionally let out a puff of lavender steam. Another is a shimmering silhouette of a woman, whose outline seems to be drawn by the very shadows around her.

They all turn towards you. The clockwork figure ticks ominously, and the shadow-woman gestures with a long, tapering finger toward a doorway that wasn't there a moment ago—a simple, unmarked door set into the air itself, shimmering like heat haze over asphalt.

You check your obsidian band: **"2 minutes remaining."**

You know, with the absolute certainty only dreams afford, that if you are late, the contract you need to sign will dissolve into the indigo sky, and the very memory of this city will be wiped from your mind forever. You take a deep breath, push open the shimmering door, and step across the threshold, expecting a boardroom, but instead finding yourself falling backward into the warm, familiar darkness of your own pillow.

The meeting is about to begin.
