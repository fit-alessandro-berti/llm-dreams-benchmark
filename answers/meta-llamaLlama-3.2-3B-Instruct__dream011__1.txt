...actually quite silly. The first question reads: "Imagine you are a chicken, and you must travel the world to the most beautiful landscapes. Where would you go first?" There's no multiple choice, just a blank space for a written answer.

The second question is: "Write a poem about a forgotten sock that has been lost in the washing machine for years. Make sure to include the sock's feelings about its loss and its hopes for being reunited with its mate."

As I glance around the exam room, I notice that everyone else seems just as perplexed as I am. Some are scribbling down answers, while others are just staring blankly at the paper.

The third question appears to be a math problem, but the numbers don't seem to add up. It reads: "If a group of elephants can eat 10,000 pounds of hay per day, and they need to eat for 365 days, how many pounds of hay will they eat in total? (Please use your knowledge of elephant digestive systems to arrive at a correct answer.)"

I take a deep breath, shake my head, and wonder what kind of future career I'll end up with if I answer these questions correctly...
