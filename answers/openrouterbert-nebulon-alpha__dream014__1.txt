**The Dream Continues…**

You hesitate for a moment—trust doesn’t come easily in dreams, not when the city’s neon glow flickers like a dying heartbeat, and the crowd’s murmurs twist into whispers you can’t quite understand. But their eyes are warm, their hands steady as they guide you through the labyrinth of streets.

One of them, a woman with silver-streaked hair and a voice like wind chimes, presses a small, folded map into your palm. *"This isn’t the way you think it is,"* she says, tapping the paper. The ink shifts under your fingers, lines rearranging themselves into a path you *almost* recognize—a route that wasn’t there before. The others nod, their faces blurring at the edges, as if they’re not quite solid, not quite real.

You follow them down an alley where the walls breathe, where the cobblestones hum beneath your feet. The city’s noise fades, replaced by the sound of distant laughter, the rustle of leaves you can’t see. A door appears at the end of the alley—old, wooden, slightly ajar. The strangers stop, stepping back to let you approach.

*"This is where we leave you,"* says a man with a scar across his cheek, his smile sad. *"But you’re not lost anymore."*

You push the door open. Inside, the air is golden, thick with the scent of rain and something sweet—like childhood summers. The room is vast, yet cozy, filled with mismatched furniture, books with titles you’ve never heard of, and a fire crackling in a hearth that wasn’t there a second ago. A figure sits in an armchair, their back to you, but you *know* them. You’ve always known them.

They turn. It’s *you*—but not the you that’s standing in the doorway. This version of you is older, softer, their eyes crinkling with a quiet knowing. *"Took you long enough,"* they say, and the words unravel something tight in your chest.

The dream shifts again. The city is gone. You’re standing in a field under a sky streaked with violet and gold, the strangers now distant figures waving from the horizon. The other-you hands you a key. *"For when you’re ready."*

And then—

You wake up.

Your room is dark, but the key is still in your hand. Or is it? You can’t tell if it’s real or just the echo of the dream, lingering like the aftertaste of a half-remembered song. Outside, the city hums, indifferent. But for the first time in a long time, you don’t feel lost.

You feel *found*.
