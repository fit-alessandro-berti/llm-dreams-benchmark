…you realize you need to pretend you belong here.

Because whatever era this is, they’re already staring at you.

A cart rattles past on uneven cobblestones, the wooden wheels squealing. The driver gives you a brief, suspicious look—your clothes are wrong, your posture is wrong, even the way you’re looking around is wrong. You’re too startled, too alert. People here are used to the weight of the world; you look like you’ve just been dropped into it.

You force yourself to breathe slowly and walk like you know where you’re going.

The air smells different: smoke, damp wool, something metallic. No hum of electricity, no distant car engines, no glowing signs. The buildings are close together, leaning inward over a narrow street as if gossiping. Wooden shutters instead of windows. Hand-painted symbols instead of logos.

You pass a stall where a woman sells bread from a cloth-covered basket. The crust is thick and dark, the kind that needs real teeth and real hunger. She watches you too long. You realize you’re still barefoot.

You need answers.
You need a story.
You need a plan to survive until you figure out how to wake up—if this *is* a dream.

A group of children dash around you, chasing a hoop with a stick, their laughter bright and sharp. One of them bumps your leg and mutters an apology in a language you almost recognize, like a dialect of something you once studied or heard in a documentary. You catch fragments, a few words that land in your mind with strange familiarity.

You try them out under your breath, shaping the sounds quietly as you walk. Your tongue stumbles, but your ears adjust quickly, filling in the gaps, guessing the grammar. A part of you that has always loved patterns sits up and takes notes.

You realize you need to learn the language *fast*.

On the corner, an old man sits on a low stool sharpening a knife with patient strokes. Sparks flicker. Above him hangs a simple sign carved with a symbol of a blade and a whetstone—no words, just a picture. You point to the knife, then to yourself, miming cutting, then shrugging like: *I don’t know the word.*

The man squints at you, then chuckles. He says the word. Slowly. Twice.

You repeat it. You’re clumsy, but not hopeless.

He corrects you, gestures with the knife—gentle, as if he’s used to teaching. The exchange lasts less than a minute, but something shifts. The language feels like a locked door with the key already half-turned.

You thank him with an awkward nod and move on, repeating the new word in your head like a charm.

You realize you need to pay attention to *everything*:
The way people dress.
The way they greet each other.
Who moves aside for whom.
Who looks at the ground and who never does.

No one is wearing anything like a wristwatch. Time is told by bells in the distance, by the angle of the sun, by habit. A boy runs past holding a bundle of thin reeds and a wax tablet. A messenger, maybe. You file it away.

You catch your reflection in a warped bit of metal nailed to a post—a makeshift mirror. Your face is the same, but flatter somehow, with no glow from any screen, no reflections of city lights in your pupils. You look almost like you belong here already.

Almost.

You wander toward the sound of voices. A market square opens up ahead, full of movement. Stalls with vegetables you recognize and some you don’t. Clay jugs. Bundles of dyed wool. A man with a small cage full of birds with jewel-bright eyes and sharp beaks.

At the edge of the square, a wooden board is nailed to a post. Strips of paper or parchment hang from it, pressed down with wax seals. Official notices, maybe. Wanted posters. Public decrees.

You step closer.

The writing is nothing you’ve seen before—and yet, again, pieces of it slide into place. The symbols are unfamiliar, but the structure is not. Your brain begins to map strokes to sounds the same way it did when you were a child learning your first alphabet, except now you’re older and know how to cheat: patterns, repetition, context.

You realize you *can* learn to read this, if you stay long enough.

That thought hits harder than you expect.

*If I stay.*

What if you can’t wake up?
What if this *isn’t* a dream?

“Lost?”

The voice is close and dry with amusement.

You turn. A person stands beside you, mid-30s maybe, dressed in clothes that match the era but worn with a kind of casual confidence that makes them stand out—like someone who knows how this place works but doesn’t quite belong anywhere in it. Their eyes study your face with unsettling focus.

You search your mind for the right reply in this half-known language. What comes out is halting, but intelligible: a rough version of, “First time here.”

Their eyebrows lift. “I can tell,” they say. “You’re staring at the proclamation like it’s going to bite you.”

They switch languages mid-sentence—and suddenly you understand them perfectly. It’s your native tongue, sliding over your ears like water over stone.

“You understand this, yes?” they ask, in your own language.

Your heart stutters. “How do you—”

“We can’t talk here,” they interrupt quietly. “Too many ears. Come.”

You hesitate, but the world is already impossible; one more impossible thing doesn’t tip the scale much. You follow them out of the square, down a narrow alley that smells like damp stone and old rain.

“Let me guess,” they say as you walk. “You fell asleep somewhere that didn’t look like this, and when you woke up, everything was wrong.”

You flinch. “Yes.”

“And you’ve been telling yourself it’s just a dream, because that’s easier than the alternatives.”

You don’t answer.

They lead you into a small courtyard tucked behind crooked buildings. There’s a well in the center, stone worn smooth by hands and time. No one else is here. They lean against the wall and fold their arms.

“There are others like you,” they say. “Like us.”

“Us?”

“People who wake up… displaced. From different times. Different worlds, sometimes.” They shrug. “We call ourselves Dreamers because it’s the only word everyone understands. It’s not accurate, but accuracy isn’t the first priority when you’re trying not to panic.”

“So this *isn’t* a dream.”

They tilt their head. “Does it matter? If you can starve, if you can bleed, if you can learn a language and grow old here and never see your old life again—would you comfort yourself with the label?”

You swallow.

“What do you want from me?” you ask.

“Want?” They laugh softly. “Very little. But you need some things, whether you realize it or not. You need to blend in before you draw the wrong kind of attention. You need shelter. Food. A name that doesn’t sound like it was dropped here from the sky.”

You give your real name out of habit.

They repeat it, adjusting the vowels until it sounds like it belongs in this era. “Better,” they say. “We’ll use that.”

“And then?” you ask.

“And then you decide,” they say. “Some Dreamers spend their whole lives trying to get back. Some decide this is their life now and make something of it. Some… don’t decide anything, and the world decides for them.”

A gust of wind flicks your hair into your face. You brush it aside, strangely irritated that even here, in an impossible courtyard in a time that shouldn’t exist for you, the wind still does what it wants.

“Is there a way back?” you ask finally. “For anyone?”

They look at you for a long moment. “Sometimes,” they say. “For a few. It always costs something. And you never get to choose what it costs.”

You realize you need to choose what you’re more afraid of:
Living a new life here.
Or going back changed, knowing this place exists.

The person watches your face as if reading your thoughts. “No need to decide now,” they say more gently. “Right now you only need one thing.”

They tap the side of their head. “You need to stay awake.”

“I *am* awake,” you say.

“Are you?” they ask. “If this is a dream, then what happens if you fall asleep *in* it?”

The question leaves a cold trail down your spine.

They push away from the wall. “Come on. We’ll get you clothes that don’t look like a story someone made up. I’ll show you where the other Dreamers meet. You can ask questions there. You can listen. You can decide who you want to be in this story.”

You follow them back through the alley, into the living noise of the era that has swallowed you. Every sound seems sharper now. Every color more solid. A bell rings the hour, and the square shifts in response—a tide changing direction.

And as you walk, you become aware of two things at once:

1. Your feet hurt. The stones are unforgiving, and you are entirely, painfully aware of your body.
2. Somewhere, faint and far away, there is the memory of another bed, another room, another morning where your phone lay next to you, dark and lifeless.

You realize you can no longer tell which one is the memory and which one is the dream.

Someone bumps into you and mutters that almost-familiar apology again. This time, you answer back in the halting new language, just good enough to make them nod and move on.

The person walking beside you smiles slightly. “You learn quickly,” they say.

You don’t answer. You’re too busy repeating the sounds, memorizing the cadence, quietly building the version of yourself who survives here.

You cross the square together, swallowed by the crowd, the bells, and the unshakable feeling that one day you will wake up again—to a third life—and wonder if *this* was the dream you never finished.
