…and each new cluster feels less like a party and more like a puzzle that’s rearranging itself around you.

1. The Mask‑Sharers  
A ring of guests pass papier‑mâché masks to the left every few seconds, so no one’s face stays the same for long. When the mask with the cracked cheek lands in your hands, everyone freezes and stares as though you’ve stolen their cue. You try to hand it off, but the circle has become a solid wall of velvet jackets. When you finally slip the mask onto your own face, the wall softens into an aisle and you’re able to walk through.

2. The Whisper Buffet  
Silver platters float above a banquet table, each piled not with food but with loose sentences: glowing words you can pluck like grapes. You pick one that reads, “They’re waiting upstairs,” and it dissolves on your tongue, tasting faintly of mint and déjà vu. The other sentences rearrange themselves into a single line that points toward a spiral staircase.

3. The Upside‑Down Orchestra  
Halfway up the stairs you step onto a landing that is also a ceiling; musicians hang beneath you, playing instruments whose notes drip upward like colored rain. You recognize the tune—your friend’s favorite song—but it’s being played in reverse. You ask the conductor where the melody is coming from. He answers by turning his music stand around: the sheet music is blank except for your name written repeatedly along the staves.

4. The Hall of Doors That Breathe  
At the top, a corridor stretches in both directions, lined with doors that inhale and exhale. When the hall breathes in, every door sinks into the wall; when it exhales, they bulge outward again and their knobs pulse like hearts. One door is steady, neither moving nor breathing. It bears the small enamel pin your friend always wears.

5. The Rooftop of Quiet Applause  
You open the steady door and step onto a rooftop garden under an indigo sky. A gentle applause drifts from nowhere, like hands clapping inside mittens. Your friend stands at the railing, back turned, watching constellations rearrange themselves into old photographs of the two of you. When you call their name, they turn, but their face is yours—older, calmer, lit by starlight.

They smile and say, “I knew you’d find me once you stopped looking for someone else.” You try to ask what that means, but the dream folds along a crease of moonlight, the rooftop tilts, and you tumble—not down but inward—into waking.
