…not questions at all. They’re instructions written in your own handwriting, the ink still wet, the date in the corner from a week that hasn’t happened yet.

1. **Show your work:** Prove you were paying attention the whole time. Use examples from childhood, borrowed books, and the way you hold your breath before answering.

2. **Balance the equation:** hunger + time = ______.

3. **Multiple choice:** Which door did you pretend wasn’t there?
   A) The one with the light under it
   B) The one with your name scratched off
   C) The revolving one you kept calling “plan”
   D) Other: explain

The margins mutter, thick with footnotes about things you’ve almost remembered. The proctor paces, but their shoes make the sound of second hands on a clock rather than footsteps. When you raise your head, you realize the proctor has your face, a little older, a little kinder, tapping a wristwatch that has no numbers.

The room keeps being a room until it doesn’t. The ceiling peels back like the first page of a book and you can see a sky pocked with chalk dust and birds that look suspiciously like eraser shavings. Desks slide soft as ice. Everyone around you is studying the same single page, yet the diagrams are different: on your neighbor’s paper, a ladder; on another’s, a kitchen; on yours, the coastline of a country you never visited and somehow miss anyway.

Question 4 asks you to **diagram a decision**. The key provided is a paper compass that only points to places you’ve refused to go. You draw a tiny map of your hesitation and label it “caution.” Then you cross it out and label it “care.”

Question 5 instructs you to **disassemble a clock** and **reassemble a memory**. You pry the test stapler like a tiny crowbar and the clock on the wall falls into neat, polite pieces. Inside, instead of gears, there are folded notes you wrote yourself: “Call them back.” “Take water.” “Stop pretending you don’t know.” You tuck those into your pocket like contraband.

The paper smells like pencil shavings and rain on hot concrete. Words keep slipping off the lines and landing in your lap—“almost,” “after,” “again.” You place them back where they belong. They wriggle, then settle.

A whisper from the margin: **Extra credit:** Tell the truth in the smallest possible number of words.

You try. You write: “I care.” The letters feel too light, so you add, “Enough to change.” The page sighs as if relieved.

Somewhere between Question 6 and 7, the exam becomes a **practicum**. You must carry a glass of water to the front without spilling, while everyone watches. Your hands tremble the way hands do when they’re rehearsing for a life. The water overflows, but sideways, like a tide defying gravity; it climbs the walls and turns the chalkboard into a window. Through it you see a shoreline. On the sand, a version of you is building something that wants to be a lighthouse and keeps becoming a table. You realize you’ve been preparing for both—signal and place to sit—this whole time.

“Time,” says the proctor-that-is-you, but they’re smiling, and the word doesn’t mean “stop” so much as “begin.”

You flip to the last page. There is only one prompt, printed neat and plain:

**Final Question:** Write the instructions for your future to find you.

You stare until the words blur. Then you take off your watch—imaginary, but heavy—set it on the desk, and write:

* Start where you are.
* Knock on the door with the light under it.
* Bring water and a pen.
* When you hear the second hands, listen for the silence between them.
* Choose the answer that lets you be kind.
* If lost, ask for directions out loud.

You sign your name, and the signature opens like a hinge. The paper warms under your palm. The birds that were eraser shavings lift, real now, or close enough.

You stand to turn in the test, but there is nowhere to turn it in. There is only a doorway you hadn’t noticed, labeled “Submit.” You’ve written the label yourself. The proctor nods. You carry your glass, half-full, through the door.

On the other side is a desk, the same one, and a first page waiting, blank as morning.

You sit. You pick up your pencil. You begin.
