...and you feel an immediate, icy grip of panic clutch your chest. Your hands, usually so adept, feel suddenly clumsy, like they're made of thick, unbaked dough. You try to reach for the keyboard, but your fingers refuse to obey, hovering just above the keys as if caught in a thick, invisible syrup.

Your boss, who was just a normal person moments ago, seems to grow in size. Their head nearly brushes the low ceiling, and their eyes, though still technically looking at you, seem to pierce through you, seeing every moment of your impending failure. The air in the room thickens, becoming strangely resonant, amplifying every subtle shift of their weight. The single fluorescent light above your cubicle begins to hum louder and louder, vibrating so intensely that the papers on your desk flutter and then lift, suspended in the air.

You glance down at the project brief, hoping to find a familiar word, a starting point. But the words on the page are no longer English. They've morphed into a swirling vortex of impossible symbols – hieroglyphs that writhe and pulse, then shift into complex mathematical equations that dissolve into abstract art, then back again, faster and faster, making your head spin.

A single, red digit blinks on the corner of your monitor, a countdown you hadn't noticed before: **00:00:05**.

Your boss clears their throat, and the sound is no longer just a cough but a deep, rolling thunder that echoes through the now cavernous office. The walls begin to ripple like fabric, stretching and distorting, the cubicle dividers growing impossibly tall, forming a vast, inescapable maze around you. You realize the "project" isn't a document anymore, but a single, impossibly fragile glass orb glowing faintly on your desk, and you know, with a dream-like certainty, that if you touch it, the world will end. You have to *start* the project, but you can't touch it.

The countdown blazes: **00:00:01**.

You try to cry out, to explain, but your voice is gone, replaced by a desperate, silent scream caught in your throat. The walls close in, the air grows impossibly dense, and the glass orb on your desk starts to glow with blinding intensity, pulsing faster and faster, until...

You bolt upright in bed, gasping, tangled in your sheets, your heart pounding a frantic rhythm against your ribs. The digital clock on your nightstand glows peacefully: 3:47 AM. The room is quiet, still. The only impossible deadline you face is getting back to sleep before the alarm goes off.
