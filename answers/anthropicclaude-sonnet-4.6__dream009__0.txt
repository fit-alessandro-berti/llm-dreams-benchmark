# The Dream Continues...

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find your place before the sun sets.**

---

The air smells of woodsmoke and wet earth. You're lying in tall grass, and when you sit up, the skyline hits you like cold water — **no towers, no wires, no hum of anything electrical.** Just rolling hills, a dense forest at the edge of a valley, and a village perhaps half a mile away, its thatched rooftops catching the amber afternoon light.

*Medieval,* some part of your sleeping mind whispers. *Definitely medieval.*

Your clothes are wrong. You're already drawing stares from a boy herding geese along a muddy path nearby. He's maybe ten years old, wearing rough-spun linen, and he's looking at you the way you might look at someone who just fell from the sky.

Because, from his perspective, you essentially did.

You stand up slowly and raise your hands — *friendly, harmless* — and offer the only currency you currently have:

**A smile.**

He doesn't run.

That feels like a beginning.

The village bell begins to toll somewhere in the distance, low and bronze and ancient, and you take your first deliberate step forward — toward the smoke, toward the people, toward whatever this dream decides you're supposed to learn here.

Your heart is pounding. But underneath the fear, something else stirs.

**Curiosity. Pure and wild and alive.**

*What happens next?*
