 find water. Not just any water—potable water—but your throat is parchment-dry and the sun hangs at a merciless angle that suggests high afternoon in late summer. 

You’re lying in long grass that scratches at your forearms, wearing clothes that feel wrong against your skin: rough-spun wool, perhaps, or softened leather that smells of smoke and tallow. When you sit up, the horizon tilts—not with the familiar geometry of steel and glass, but with rounded thatched roofs and the dark spires of pine forest climbing hills that have never known asphalt.

Your first instinct is to reach for your phone, but your fingers find only a braided cord at your waist, perhaps a belt or a pouch. The silence is the most disorienting thing. No electrical hum, no distant traffic drone. Instead: the percussive clacking of someone threshing grain, a dog’s bark that carries across an impossible distance, and wind moving through grass with a sound like silk.

You need to find water, yes, but more urgently, you need to *belong* before you are discovered. Already, a child has paused at the edge of the clearing, staring at you with eyes too wide, holding a basket of berries suspended halfway to the ground. The child wears a necklace of teeth—wolf, maybe, or bear—and her silence suggests you are either a spirit or a threat.

In dreams, language barriers dissolve like sugar in rain, but here you feel the weight of comprehension slipping. The girl calls out a word that sounds like "*Khet?*" or "*Guest?*" and the inflection rises at the end, questioning.

You realize you need to choose: run toward the tree line where the dark woods promise concealment but also wolves and starvation, or step forward with empty hands raised, hoping that hospitality is older than history, hoping that in this era, before the invention of strangers, a desperate traveler might still be taken in.

The air smells of woodsmoke and coming rain. Your stomach clenches—not with fear alone, but with the sudden, crushing nostalgia for a world you’ve already lost, one where the answer to every question was just a search away. Here, you will need to remember how to read clouds, how to distinguish edible tubers from poisonous ones, how to sleep without locking doors.

The girl takes a step toward you. Her feet are bare and her ankles are stained with clay. She offers you a berry, cupped in her palm like a jewel, and you understand that this is the test—eat, accept, become real in this dream, or refuse and wake up to the alarm clock that is surely ringing somewhere in the twenty-first century, if twenty-first centuries still exist.

Your fingers tremble as you reach for the fruit.
