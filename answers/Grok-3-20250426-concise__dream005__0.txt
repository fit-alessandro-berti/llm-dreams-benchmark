overhear strange conversations. One group discusses a secret portal in the garden; another debates a floating island they’ve seen. Your friend appears, whispering, “Follow me.” They lead you to a glowing door hidden behind vines. You step through into a vibrant forest where animals speak and time feels fluid. A fox guides you to a clearing with a mirror showing your past and future selves. You reach out, and the mirror ripples, pulling you in—then you wake up.
