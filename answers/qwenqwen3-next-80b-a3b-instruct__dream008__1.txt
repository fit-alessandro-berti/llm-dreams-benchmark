You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you—  

—realize the project is a giant, glowing origami crane made of shifting holograms, stitched together with threads of forgotten phone calls and half-written to-do lists. It hums softly, vibrating with the weight of every unmet expectation you’ve ever had.

Your boss? They’re not your boss anymore.

They’re a porcelain doll wearing your old tie, its face smooth and featureless except for one blinking eye that flickers like a dying bulb. It holds out a pencil made of solidified silence.

“Finish it before the third chime,” it says. Its voice is the sound of your alarm clock on a Monday you never woke up to.

You grab the pencil—cold as a gravestone—and try to draw the crane’s wings. But every line you sketch dissolves into emojis: 😅🚫💡📉📦🔥…

Around you, the office transforms. Cubicles become tree trunks. Coffee machines sprout roots. Your coworkers? They’re now statues of themselves, frozen mid-sigh, eyes glowing with the soft blue of low-battery notifications.

The clock ticks.

*One…*

You panic. You try to code the crane’s movement. But the keyboard types only haikus:

> *Deadline screams in binary,*  
> *I miss my cat’s soft purr,*  
> *Why is my hands glowing?*

*Two…*

You look down.

Your hands are translucent. Inside them, tiny versions of you are sprinting across spreadsheets, carrying lanterns labeled “Do Not Panic.” One of them trips. The lantern shatters. A paragraph of your childhood dream—*“I’ll be an astronaut who paints clouds”*—drifts into the air and vanishes.

The doll tilts its head.

“You’re running out of excuses,” it whispers.

*Three…*

The crane flares—brighter than a supernova made of overdue emails.

You close your eyes.

And instead of drawing…

You breathe.

The crane shudders.

Then folds itself—not into a bird—but into a single word: *Enough.*

The office dissolves into starlight.

The doll crumbles to dust that smells like lavender and old printer ink.

And as you wake—sweating, heart racing—you hear your phone buzz.

It’s your boss.

*“You good? Just checking in. Project deadline’s moved to Friday. You were out cold. You muttered something about origami."*

You stare at your hands.

Still glowing.

Slightly.

You smile.

For the first time in years, you don’t reach for your laptop.

You open a sketchbook.

And begin to paint a cloud.

—  
*The dream never ends. You just learn how to sleep through the chimes.*
