speak, but instead of words, bubbles filled with colorful fish erupt from your mouth, floating up toward the ceiling lights. The audience gasps in delight, not horror, and starts applauding wildly as the fish-bubbles multiply, raining down sparkles over the crowd.

You try to steady yourself, gripping the podium, but it morphs into a giant banana peel under your hands, slipping you forward. Suddenly, you're sliding across the stage on your belly like a penguin on ice, the crowd cheering louder. Spotlights swirl into candy cane stripes, and the microphone in your hand turns into a live microphone—wait, no, a microphone that sprouts tiny wings and flies away, singing opera in a squeaky voice.

Panic sets in as you realize your suit has vanished, replaced by a tutu made of glowing feathers. You stand up, twirl involuntarily, and the audience joins in, all wearing matching tutus, dancing the Macarena in perfect sync. Just as you're about to belt out the chorus in whale song, the stage tilts like a funhouse mirror, and you tumble into a cotton candy cloud.

You wake up laughing, tangled in your sheets, the echo of applause still ringing in your ears. What a weird dream!
