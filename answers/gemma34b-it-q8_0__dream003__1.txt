You are given a mysterious locked wooden chest - not ornate like a jeweler's or a king’s, but sturdy and practical, the wood darkly stained moss-grey with veins like silver threading throughout it. It's cold to the touch, strangely cool like polished river stone. No latches or obvious hinges are visible. Just solid timber. 

As I examine it keenly, I notice intricate patterns. Not carved into the surface – they seem to shift and ripple beneath my fingers when I glance away, like water reflecting sunlight on a still lake. They aren't visible linearly; they form fleeting patterns, spiralling downwards into what could be swirling storms or expanding galaxies. And they pulse with a faint heat, just barely perceptible, a living warmth that draws the eye back time and again. 

Drawn closer, I realize the patterns are actually tiny, almost microscopic, representations of faces - not individual faces, exactly. But a composite of millions of tiny faces, merging and separating like waves crashing against each other, arguing then yielding to calm. Each tiny profile has an undeniable sense of sorrow, of remembered memories. 


As I lean in closer still, a sound begins –a whisper, so faint I can’t quite understand the words spoken, but I instinctively know they are coming from *within* the chest itself. The patterns accelerate, brighter now, and one particular spiral intensifies, highlighting a single, stark representation within it - a boy, maybe eight years old, lost looking into an eternally grey and foggy forest. <0xC2><0xA0> 


Touching the chest one last time, the whisper builds into a single sentence: 'He doesn't remember.’ 

Then, suddenly, I am falling.

Would you like to tell me what happens next, or would you like me to flesh out the dream further in a specific direction (e.gl., what’s inside the box? What do I do? Do I get any further fragmented flashes of memory)?
