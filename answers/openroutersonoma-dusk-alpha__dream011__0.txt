You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a swirling, ancient script that shifts like sand dunes under a desert wind—symbols that morph into faces, whispering secrets about your deepest fears and forgotten memories. The proctor, a shadowy figure with eyes like glowing embers, leans in and murmurs, "Answer with your soul, or the ink will consume you."

Panic surges as the first question uncoils: "What is the weight of a forgotten promise?" Your pen trembles, but instead of words, it spills colors—vivid reds and blues that paint the room into a labyrinth of floating doors. You choose one at random, stepping through into a marketplace where merchants hawk dreams like ripe fruit. There, you barter for clues, trading pieces of your childhood laughter for a riddle: "The career you seek is not forged in steel, but in the echoes of what might have been."

The dream twists; the exam hall becomes a vast ocean, questions bobbing like buoys. You swim toward the next one—"Define the horizon of regret"—only to find it's a mirror reflecting infinite versions of yourself, each pursuing a different path: astronaut, poet, thief, healer. A whale surfaces, swallowing the paper, and you dive after it into abyssal depths where bioluminescent fish spell out the final query: "Will you wake, or claim this fate as your own?"

As the pressure builds, the dream fractures. You grasp a glowing answer key, but it dissolves into stardust, pulling you upward through layers of sleep. Just as clarity dawns—your true career is the dreamer itself—the alarm of reality blares, and you jolt awake, heart pounding, wondering if the exam was ever real.
