You are dreaming. Can you complete the following dream?

You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to realize that you have forgotten your notes. Panic starts to set in as you try to remember the words you had so carefully prepared. 

As you approach the podium, you suddenly notice that you're not wearing any clothes. The realization sends a wave of embarrassment through your body, and you feel exposed and vulnerable in front of the sea of faces. 

You try to cover yourself with your hands, but it's too late. The audience has already noticed your state of undress, and you hear a mixture of gasps and laughter rippling through the crowd. Your face flushes red with shame, and you feel the urge to run off the stage.

But then, something unexpected happens. A voice from the back of the room shouts, \ doesn't matter what you're wearing! We're here to hear your message!\d begins to cheer and applaud, and you feel a surge of confidence wash over you.

You take a deep breath and begin to speak, your words flowing effortlessly despite the absence of your notes. As you share your ideas and insights, the audience listens intently, nodding and smiling in agreement. 

As you reach the end of your speech, the crowd rises to their feet, giving you a standing ovation. You feel a sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing that you have overcome your fears and delivered a powerful message.

As the dream begins to fade, you wake up with a smile on your face, realizing that sometimes the greatest obstacles we face are the ones we create in our own minds.
