 …open your mouth, but no sound emerges—only a slow, spiraling ribbon of silver light that drifts toward the audience like smoke. You panic for a moment, grasping for your notes, but the paper has turned to wet clay in your hands, crumbling into dust that smells like your grandmother’s attic.

The crowd doesn’t seem to notice. Instead, they’re changing. The faces in the front row elongate, not grotesquely, but like reflections in water during a rainstorm. A woman in a blue dress becomes a tree; a man in a suit becomes a door standing slightly ajar. You try to step back, but the stage has grown impossibly wide, the floorboards now sand that shifts beneath your feet, each grain humming a different note.

You realize with that strange, accepting logic of dreams that you were never meant to speak words at all. Your speech is supposed to be woven from the threads of your sweater, which is unraveling into golden yarn that writes itself across the air in cursive light. The audience—now a murmuration of starlings, now a field of sunflowers turning to face you—leans in, not with judgment, but with hunger for the taste of the color you’re exhaling: a shade of violet that exists only in the pause between lightning and thunder.

You begin to dance, or maybe you’re swimming upward through honey-thick air. The podium has become a piano, and when you place your hands on the keys, the music that comes out is the memory of rain on a window you’ve never seen, yet somehow lived inside. The crowd sighs as one, and their breath lifts you, weightless, until you’re floating above them, looking down at a thousand faces that are all your own, smiling back with eyes closed, knowing exactly what you were going to say before you forgot.
