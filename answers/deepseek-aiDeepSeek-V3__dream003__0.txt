symbols etched into its surface, spiraling and intertwining like ancient runes or forgotten scripts. The box seems to hum faintly, a soft vibration that resonates in your chest, as if it’s alive. Your fingers trace the patterns, and they feel warm to the touch, almost as if they’re guiding your hand.  

As you continue to explore the box, a strange sensation washes over you—a feeling that this isn’t just any box, but something deeply connected to you, as though it holds a piece of your own story. The symbols begin to glow faintly, pulsating in rhythm with your heartbeat.  

Suddenly, a voice whispers in the air, not from anywhere in particular, but all around you. It’s soft, yet commanding, and it speaks words you don’t understand, yet somehow, you sense their meaning: *“Only the key within can unlock the truth.”*  

You pause, confused. There’s no key, no lock visible. But then, your hand instinctively moves to your chest, as if drawn there by an unseen force. You feel something beneath your skin—a warmth, a presence. Closing your eyes, you take a deep breath, and in that moment, you realize the key isn’t something physical. It’s within you.  

You focus, quieting your mind, and imagine that warmth growing, spreading from your chest into your hand. When you open your eyes, you see a faint glow emanating from your fingertips. Slowly, you press your hand against the box, and the symbols flare brightly, casting an otherworldly light.  

The box clicks, and the lid begins to open on its own. Inside, you see...  

The dream shifts, and the box fades into a mist, leaving you with an overwhelming sense of clarity. You don’t know what was inside, but you know it was something important—something that has always been a part of you, waiting to be discovered.  

You wake with a start, the feeling still lingering, like a question unanswered, a mystery just out of reach. The dream fades, but the sense of connection remains, as if the box and its secrets are still there, waiting for you to unlock them again.
