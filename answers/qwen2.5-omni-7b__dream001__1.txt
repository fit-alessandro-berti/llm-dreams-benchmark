search for clues on your phone, but there's no signal. As you walk around, you notice strange symbols etched into the walls of buildings and on the ground. You decide to follow one of them, hoping it might lead you to your destination.

As you continue down the street, you come across a group of people gathered outside a large building. They seem to be waiting for someone or something. Curious, you approach them and ask if they know anything about your meeting. One of them recognizes you from earlier that day when you were looking for directions and tells you that he knows where the meeting is taking place.

He leads you through a maze-like alleyway until you reach a hidden door. The door opens to reveal a grand ballroom filled with people dressed in formal attire. Your meeting partner is already there, waiting for you. You exchange pleasantries before getting down to business.

After the meeting, you thank your new acquaintance for his help and ask him how he knew where to find you. He smiles and says, "I'm just a bit of a local, I guess." And with that, he disappears back into the crowd as you make your way out of the building.
