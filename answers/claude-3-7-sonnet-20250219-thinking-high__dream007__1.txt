You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to...

...take a deep breath and suggest walking together instead of continuing to stand face-to-face in confrontation. As you both begin walking, the setting around you shifts strangely - the room elongates into a beach shoreline, the sound of waves replacing the echo of raised voices.

Neither of you acknowledges this impossible change. You walk in silence for a while, your footprints leaving glowing impressions in the sand behind you. The physical distance somehow creates space for your thoughts to realign.

\ you said,\d of what it means.\, their face simultaneously familiar and shifting like water. They reach out, but their hand transforms into a small bird that flies circles around you both, carrying your unspoken feelings between you.

You understand something profound without words being exchanged. The argument wasn't about the surface issue at all, but about a deeper fear of losing connection.

The dream begins folding in on itself, the sky and sand merging into a gentle swirl of light. Before you wake, you feel the warm certainty that when you see your friend tomorrow in the waking world, you'll both remember what really matters.
