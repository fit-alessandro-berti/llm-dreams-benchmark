You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a shifting, ancient script you can’t decipher. Frustrated, you squint harder—and suddenly the words rearrange into fragments of your own memories: *"Why did you abandon piano lessons?"* *"Was it fear that made you walk away?"* 

Your pulse quickens as you scribble an answer, only to watch the ink dissolve and the question morph again—this time into a future you don’t recognize. *"What will you sacrifice to succeed?"* The room tilts; the walls ripple like water. 

Desperate, you grip the desk, but the exam paper turns blank. A whisper echoes in your mind: *"The test isn’t the questions. It’s whether you’ll keep asking them."* The room fades to white, and you awake with a gasp—the taste of unfinished thoughts lingering like smoke.
