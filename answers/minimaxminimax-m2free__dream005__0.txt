You continue through the crowd, your eyes scanning for familiar faces. 

The first group you approach are laughing and passing around a strange, glowing orb that seems to pulse with their collective heartbeat. When you ask if they've seen your friend, they look at you with knowing smiles but speak in languages that shift between words you understand and sounds that feel important but make no logical sense.

You move on through a dimly lit corridor lined with mirrors, each reflection showing you in different clothes - sometimes formal attire, sometimes pajamas, sometimes as a child. In one mirror, you glimpse your friend across a vast dance floor, but when you turn to look, the mirror shows only empty space behind you.

The next group sits in a circle on the floor, sharing what appears to be crystallized memories that shimmer and reform as they pass them around. They invite you to join, and for a moment you can almost taste the memory of the first time you met your friend - coffee and autumn leaves and the sound of laughter. But when you reach for the memory crystal, it dissolves into butterflies that flutter toward the ceiling.

The crowd thins and thickens like ocean waves. You find yourself in a room where conversations are happening entirely through song, in another where people exchange objects that look like emotions - some glowing warm yellow, others sharp and crystalline blue. You ask each person about your friend, and they all nod as if they know exactly who you mean, but their directions contradict each other.

Your friend's voice finally reaches you, seemingly from everywhere and nowhere: "I'm right here, I was always here, you just have to remember what you're really looking for."
