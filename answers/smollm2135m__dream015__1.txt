I have made my decision just like that. I am in our post-apriciation area - an unforgiving landscape of scavenged metal from your ruins and remnants scattered throughout - surrounded by a swarm of hostile creatures that demand food or anything else they can find for themselves. The air is thick with the smell of smoke, ozone, and sweat hanging over you like it's a living shadow. I have no time to focus on myself, just as quickly as I would give that back to the world. It feels almost... alive, like I'm being guided through a labyrinth of survival-like activities while still keeping an eye out for threats from within my own heart itself.


A sense of hunger seeps into your stomach and senses startle you to realize there's food in those crates outside - maybe even something tasty that's been stored up. A flurry of hooting silhouettes draws closer, and I know what it is: edible plants scattered upon the ground, with bits of meat glistening in their warm hands for a glimpse into human nutrition. But I'm also aware of my growing unease because these things won't just kill anyone... but will be here to do so - or worse, if you're too weak to make such decisions. It's time to take the next step, and before that I need something: more food. Maybe some fresh water nearby might help me find it; a makeshift basket, perhaps? Something in my hands could reveal what happened to me...
