...follow the flow of people, hoping to pick up on some visual clue. The city pulsed with a strange, internal rhythm, a symphony of car horns honking in a melody I couldn't decipher, conversations in tongues I didn't understand swirling around me. Every building seemed to lean inwards, their glass facades distorted, reflecting the sky in fractured shards.  

Heightening my anxiety was the insistent tug in my pocket. I fumbled for my phone, but it was gone. Panic threatened to overwhelm me, but then a smell hit me: cinnamon and something slightly metallic. It was a scent I associated with warmth and comfort, a beacon in this strange, cold city.

I followed the aroma, weaving through crowds of faceless people, each strangely beautiful in their anonymity, their forms shifting and merging like smoke in the wind. The scent intensified, leading me to a narrow alleyway choked with discarded flowers and vibrant murals that seemed to breathe with their own luminescent life. 

In the center of the alley, perched precariously on a stack of rusted metal sheets, sat a steaming cauldron. A woman with eyes like molten gold stirred it with a silver spoon, the same metallic tang emanating from the brew.

"Lost, child?" she asked, her voice like crackling embers.

"I need to get to a meeting," I stammered, "but I have no idea where it is."

She chuckled, a sound like wind chimes, and gestured  towards the cauldron. "The answer lies within," she said, plumping a rose petal into the bubbling liquid. "But it comes at a price."


What do I do next?
