*grips the wheel as salt spray stings my face*

...feel the wood groan beneath my hands like something alive and afraid.

The lightning splits the sky and in that flash I see my crew's faces—but they're wrong somehow. My first mate has my mother's eyes. The cabin boy is a version of myself at twelve, rope-burned palms and all.

\d steady!\ar, but my voice comes out as music, a low cello note that the wind carries away.

The waves rise into shapes. I recognize them now—every decision I've avoided, every conversation I've postponed, forming walls of black water around us.

I realize I'm not steering *through* the storm. I'm steering *toward* something. There's a light beneath the waves, golden and patient, and my hands turn the wheel on their own.

\Captain,\ the crew calls, \where are we going?\ open my mouth to answer and find I'm no longer certain if I'm the captain, the ship, or the sea itself. The boundaries have gone soft. 

The storm wants an answer. The light below wants me to dive. My crew—these fragments of everyone I've ever been—wait.

I breathe in the salt and chaos, and I choose to—

*the dream flickers, waiting for what comes next*

What do I choose?
