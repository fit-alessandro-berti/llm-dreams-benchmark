...and you gratefully accept, a wave of relief so profound it feels like stepping into warm water.

The strangers don't pull out a map or a phone. Instead, the eldest of the group, a woman with eyes the color of a twilight sky, simply smiles and holds out her hand. "The way isn't on a street," she says, her voice like the rustling of old paper. "It's in a sound. You just have to listen for it."

Another, a young man with a flute, brings the instrument to his lips. He doesn't play a melody, but a single, clear note that hangs in the air like a perfect glass bead. As you focus on it, the chaotic noise of the city—the screeching tires, the shouting voices, the distant sirens—begins to warp and bend around that one pure tone.

The world tilts. The towering, grey skyscrapers soften at the edges, their sharp lines blurring into watercolour strokes. The pavement beneath your feet is no longer hard concrete but soft, springy moss that glows with a faint phosphorescence. The strangers guide you forward, not by pointing, but by simply walking, and you follow the pull of that single, unwavering note.

You walk through alleyways that are now tunnels of woven willow branches, strung with lanterns that hold captured fireflies. You cross a street where the cars are silent, flowing streams of liquid light, and the traffic signals are gently pulsing constellations. The feeling of being lost is gone, replaced by an awestruck sense of discovery. You weren't lost; you were just on the wrong map.

Finally, the note leads you to a small, unassuming wooden door nestled between a laundromat that smells of ozone and rain, and a bakery venting the impossible scent of cinnamon and forgotten memories. The young man lowers his flute, and the note dissolves, leaving a ringing silence.

The woman with the twilight eyes gestures to the door. "Your way is through here," she says.

You turn to thank them, but they are already fading, becoming translucent, their forms dissolving back into the shifting, dream-like texture of the city. You are alone again, but not lonely.

With a deep breath, you push the door open. Inside isn't a room, but a vast, quiet field under a sky full of brilliant, unfamiliar stars. In the center of the field is a single, comfortable armchair, waiting just for you. The bustling city is a distant, gentle hum on the horizon. You sit, and you feel perfectly, wonderfully, found.
