…you reach out and the surface breathes under your fingertips, cool as moon-thought. It is not empty so much as expectant: a silence folded into linen, waiting. Around you the sky unravels into ribbons of teal and copper that knot themselves into laughing birds; the ground becomes a slow, revolving geometry of hands and clocks. The blank canvas holds none of that, and because of that it contains everything.

A brush appears in your hand—no bristles, just a filament of light that tastes of memory. When you touch it to the canvas the first color you make is not one you have words for: a quiet green that smells like rainy afternoons and the inside of a pocket. The stroke unrolls across the white and becomes a small doorway. Through it you see the corridor of a childhood house that never existed exactly as you remember, and for a second the corridor looks back.

You realize, without thinking in ordinary terms, that every mark you make folds the landscape around you; every hesitation makes an echo. Nervous, you draw a circle and the world answers by softening its edges. You draw a mountain and somewhere a hill straightens into a jagged tooth. You paint a face and it smiles, then slides down off the linen and floats toward you, dripping colors that rearrange themselves into new constellations on the ground. When you try to paint something small—a paper boat, a pocket watch—the canvas obliges, but it also paints you into the scene: your hands on the boat, your breath fogging the watch glass.

There is a pull at the center of the canvas, a place where the fibers do not quite meet. If you press there the brush becomes a key. The landscape hushes, colors pausing mid-shimmer as if holding its breath. A thought comes—clear and startling: anything you give to the canvas will live there, and anything you take from it will live in you. You could paint a door and step through into a sunset forever, or paint away a fear until it unravels into confetti. You could sign your name and leave a part of yourself behind, heavy and bright, to anchor this shifting world.

You hesitate. The canvas is limitless and, because of that, dangerous in its tenderness. You extend the brush and lay a single, deliberate line: the outline of an open palm. The painted hand reaches out and curls around yours as if to steady you. It leaves a faint smear of the nameless green on your skin, which will not wash out. You smile because the smear feels like a promise: the place between making and being is not a boundary but a corridor.

Instead of finishing the picture, you let the canvas keep a little blankness—the promise of a future stroke. The world resumes its metamorphosis as if nothing paused at all, but now the changes are threaded with your line, the places you touched answering in a new dialect. You walk away with the taste of unnamed color at the back of your throat and the brush-light tucked like a sleeping thing in your pocket. Behind you, the canvas breathes and keeps its blank, waiting for the next dreamer to decide whether to create, confess, or step inside.
