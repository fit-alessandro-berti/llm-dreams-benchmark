You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly shifting like liquid glass under a prismatic sky. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and a shimmering brush that hums with your thoughts. The moment your fingers touch it, the canvas awakens—rippling waves of emerald and sapphire erupt from the center, twisting into fractal trees that whisper forgotten melodies.

You paint a door, and it swings open to a floating city of crystal spires, where clockwork birds with feathers of fire dart between inverted waterfalls. Gravity flips; you tumble upward into a marketplace of living ideas—bouncing orbs of laughter that pop into confetti storms, sorrow-clouds raining silver tears that taste like honeyed regret.

A shadowy figure approaches, its form a mosaic of your own memories: childhood swingsets melting into starships, lost loves blooming as thorned roses. "What do you dream next?" it asks, handing you a palette of impossible hues—colors for emotions unspoken, shapes for paradoxes unsolved.

You dip the brush and stroke boldly: a bridge of woven light spans to a horizon where the sun chases its own tail. Crossing it, the world folds inward, colors inverting to reveal the canvas's secret—it's not blank; it's the back of your eyelids, and you're waking... or are you?

The dream pulses on—what do you paint now?
