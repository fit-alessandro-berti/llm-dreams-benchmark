You start to walk faster, the sidewalks rippling like water under your feet. Street signs change when you look away—FIRST AVENUE becomes FROST AVENUE, then FOREST—until the letters loosen and drift off like paper birds.

A man at a newspaper stand is selling maps, but every map is blank except for a small red dot labeled *YOU*, pulsing as if it has a heartbeat. You ask him where your meeting is.

He doesn’t look up. “You’ll know it when you’re late,” he says, and flips a page that isn’t there.

You weave through crowds that move like schools of fish, always parting just before you collide. The buildings are too tall, tilting inward as if listening. Somewhere above, a clock tower tolls, but the sound arrives before the bell swings.

You check your phone. The screen shows an appointment you don’t remember making:

**MEETING — 1 hour — Location: HERE**

A thin arrow appears on the screen, pointing straight down.

You stop. People stream around you as if you’ve become a lamppost. You look at the pavement, expecting a trapdoor, a subway grate, anything. Instead there’s a seam—an almost invisible line in the concrete, like the city was poured in two halves and never fully fused.

You kneel and press your fingertips to it. The seam warms under your touch and then, quietly, unzips.

The street opens like fabric.

Below is not darkness but a lit corridor with carpet that looks oddly familiar, the sort you’ve seen in hotels you stayed in briefly and forgot. The air smells like lemon cleaner and rain. A sign on the wall points both directions:

**CONFERENCE ROOMS A–M**  
**CONFERENCE ROOMS N–Z**

Your name is printed beneath each arrow, as if you have two futures and both are waiting.

You choose left because your body moves before your mind agrees.

As you descend, the sounds of the city fade, replaced by the soft hum of fluorescent lights. The stairs don’t end so much as decide to become a hallway. Doors line the walls, each with a small window. Through one you see a classroom. Through another, a kitchen from a childhood home. Through another, a hospital waiting room with your own reflection seated in the chair, staring at you with exhausted patience.

You keep walking, counting doors to stay calm.

At door seven, your phone buzzes.

**10 minutes remaining.**

At door eight, you hear your own laugh—faint, behind the glass, as if someone is watching an old recording of you being happy.

At door nine, you stop. The plaque beside it reads:

**ROOM 9: THE MEETING**

You smooth your clothes, suddenly aware you’re not sure what you’re wearing. Your hands come away dusted with glitter, or maybe it’s glass. You wipe your palms on your thighs anyway. You practice a neutral expression, the kind you use when you’re not sure if you’re in trouble.

You reach for the handle.

It’s warm, like someone on the other side has been holding it, waiting for you to arrive.

You open the door.

Inside is a long table made of dark wood that reflects the ceiling lights like still water. At the far end sits a person in a suit, their face obscured by the glare. There are other figures too—some upright, some slumped—like coats draped over chairs, like thoughts you meant to finish and didn’t. Name placards line the table, but they don’t have names. They have dates. They have “maybe” and “someday.” They have “if only.”

A chair near the middle is empty, pulled slightly out. The placard in front of it reads:

**NOW**

The suited figure gestures to it. “We were beginning to think you weren’t coming.”

Your mouth is dry. “What is this?”

“An update,” the figure says, voice echoing with the softness of a familiar room. “A review. A negotiation.”

A projector clicks on by itself. The screen comes down. Instead of slides, it shows a live feed of the city above—your city from a high angle, the streets rearranging themselves into a pattern. The pattern is a fingerprint.

The suited figure taps the table, and the image zooms in until the streets become lines on skin. You recognize the whorl. It’s yours.

“You’ve been trying to find the place,” they say, “but the place has been trying to find you.”

You glance at the other chairs. In one sits you at sixteen, ankles bouncing, too much energy for any room to hold. In another sits you at some age you haven’t reached yet, eyes calm in a way that makes your chest ache. In another chair there’s only a pile of notebooks, open to pages full of unfinished sentences.

“Why am I here?” you ask, though the answer is already forming like a bruise you haven’t touched yet.

The suited figure slides an envelope across the table toward you. It makes no sound. On the front, written neatly, is a single word:

**DIRECTIONS**

You open it. Inside is not paper but a small mirror, the kind you’d find in a compact. In it you see your face—but slightly out of sync, like a bad video call. Your reflection blinks a half-second late. When it smiles, you feel it in your cheeks before you decide to.

The figure says, “Tell us where you’re going.”

“I don’t know,” you whisper.

“Then choose what you’re not,” they reply, and the room grows quieter, as if even the lights are listening. “That’s always been easier for you.”

The mirror in your hand fogs with your breath. Words appear in the condensation as if someone is writing from the other side:

**YOU HAVE ONE HOUR. YOU HAVE ALWAYS HAD ONE HOUR.**

Your phone buzzes again.

**1 minute remaining.**

The suited figure stands, and when they move, the glare shifts just enough for you to see their face.

It is yours, but with the expression you wear when you’re about to say something honest.

They lean forward, palms on the table. “The meeting is with yourself,” they say. “And you’re the only one who can sign.”

A pen appears beside the mirror—silver, heavy. The paper you’re meant to sign is nowhere. The table is suddenly covered in forms, all identical, all titled:

**AGREEMENT TO ARRIVE**

Under the title are blank lines:

**Where:**  
**When:**  
**As whom:**

The suited you points at the third line. “Start there.”

Your throat tightens. The other versions of you watch without blinking. Even the pile of notebooks seems attentive, pages lifting in a draft that isn’t there.

You pick up the pen. It’s cold, the way metal is cold when it’s been waiting in a drawer. The tip hovers over the line: **As whom:**

You think of the city above, of how it moved under you, how it shifted whenever you demanded certainty. You think of all the times you waited until you were “ready,” and how readiness never arrived, only time did.

Your hand begins to write.

But the moment the first letter forms, the lights flicker and the room tilts gently, like a ship changing course. The ink on the page writhes, refusing to settle. The letters you wrote don’t spell what you meant. They spell what you avoid.

You press harder. You try again. The pen skates as if the paper is ice.

The suited you watches you struggle, and their expression softens—not pitying, just exact.

“You can’t sign as an idea,” they say. “Only as a person.”

The clock somewhere above tolls, but this time you hear it after the bell moves, the sound arriving properly, like the world is learning to follow rules again.

Your phone buzzes a final time.

**0 minutes remaining.**

The other you reaches out and touches the edge of the paper. The entire stack shivers like a living thing. “Time’s up,” they say, but their voice isn’t final. It’s an invitation.

The door behind you opens. You didn’t hear it. A wind rushes in smelling of rain and lemon cleaner and something electrical, like a storm about to break.

In the doorway stands the man from the newspaper stand, holding a map. This one isn’t blank. It’s drawn in careful ink, streets and landmarks and a tiny circle around a single building. At the top it reads:

**THIS WAY BACK TO YOUR LIFE**

He offers it to you. “You can still go,” he says. “But you’ll go as the version of you who didn’t sign.”

You look at the paper in front of you. At the line waiting for **As whom:** At the mirror that shows your face lagging behind itself.

You look at the map, at the building circled, and you realize with a jolt of recognition that the building is not in the city at all. The building is the room you’re in. The meeting has been the destination, the panic your way of keeping from arriving.

The suited you holds out their hand—not for the map, but for the pen.

“No one can do it for you,” they say. “But we can stop pretending you don’t know what to write.”

Your heart pounds, but the pounding is steady now, like footsteps.

You put the map down on the table.

You lift the pen again.

This time you don’t aim for the perfect word. You aim for the true one.

You write, slowly, as if teaching your hand a new language:

**As whom: Me.**

The ink settles. The letters stay.

The room exhales. The fluorescent hum warms into something almost like sunlight. The other versions of you begin to fade—not disappearing, but folding inward, becoming weight you can carry instead of ghosts you drag.

The suited you smiles, and for the first time the expression fits comfortably on your face.

“Good,” they say. “Now we can begin.”

The table dissolves into the street above, the conference room peeling away like wallpaper. You’re standing back in the city, but it looks different—less like a maze, more like a place. The signs hold still. The buildings stand upright. The crowd no longer parts for you; you move among them.

In your hand is the mirror from the envelope. It’s clear now, your reflection synced perfectly, eyes meeting yours without delay.

You look down at your phone.

The appointment is still there, but the location has changed.

**MEETING — Completed**  
**Next: WALK — Location: Anywhere**

You start walking.

And the city, finally, follows your lead.
