Okay, sinking deeper into the dream...

...you notice the questions are **glowing faintly**, written not in ink, but in shimmering, iridescent light. As you try to focus on the first one, the letters seem to squirm like tiny silver worms, rearranging themselves constantly.

You squint, trying to make sense of it. One moment it seems to ask about advanced theoretical astrophysics (a subject you've *never* studied), the next it morphs into a complex recipe for invisible soufflé, and then shifts again to demand you draw a detailed map of your own childhood fears using only the color blue.

Panic begins to rise in your chest, cold and sharp. You look around desperately. The other students seem utterly unfazed. One is calmly knitting with strands of what looks like boiled spaghetti. Another is meticulously building a tiny, perfect replica of the Eiffel Tower out of chewed gum on their desk.

The proctor, who you now realize is your childhood teddy bear grown to human size and wearing a stern academic gown, taps its furry paw impatiently on a large hourglass where the sand is flowing *upwards*.

"Begin," the teddy bear rumbles, its button eyes fixed on you.

You look back at the shimmering, nonsensical questions. Your pen feels strangely heavy in your hand, almost glued to the desk. You try to lift it, but it won't budge. The glowing script on the page brightens, and you hear a faint, high-pitched humming sound coming from it. The first question settles momentarily into something readable:

*"Describe the taste of the color purple."*

Your heart pounds. Your future depends on this. You take a deep breath, close your eyes, and try to remember what purple tastes like... maybe lavender? No, grapes? Panic? The humming gets louder... the room starts to slowly spin...
