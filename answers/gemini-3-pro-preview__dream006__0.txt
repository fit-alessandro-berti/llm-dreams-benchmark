…open my mouth, but instead of words, a flock of small, yellow canaries flies out. They circle the microphone, chirping a melody I remember from childhood.

I look down at my notes, but the paper has turned into a block of melting ice. As the water drips onto the stage, the wood beneath my feet softens and expands until the entire stage transforms into a giant lily pad floating on a dark lake.

The audience is no longer sitting in chairs; they are standing waist-deep in the water, but they are all wearing tuxedos and evening gowns, completely dry. They applaud slowly, but the sound is that of heavy rain hitting a tin roof. I realize then that I don't need to finish the speech because the speech is the rain, so I lie down on the lily pad and dissolve into the fog rolling in from the wings.
