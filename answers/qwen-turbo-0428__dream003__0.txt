You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and symbols etched into its surface—some glowing faintly as if responding to your presence. The metal is cool to the touch, yet it hums with an almost imperceptible vibration, like a heartbeat just beyond hearing.

As you trace the patterns with your fingers, a soft click echoes in the silence. The lid creaks open slightly, revealing a swirling darkness within, like a portal to another realm. From the depths, a whisper rises—not in any language you know, but in a tone that resonates in your bones.

"You have awakened the Keeper."

Before you can react, the box begins to glow, and the room around you shifts. The walls dissolve into a vast, star-filled void. You stand on a platform of light, and before you, a figure materializes—a being of shifting forms, neither male nor female, neither young nor old. Its eyes hold the weight of eons.

"It has been long since one sought the Box of Echoes," it says, its voice layered with countless others. "Will you accept the trial?"

The box closes again, now resting in your hands, heavier than before. A choice presents itself: to open it again and face whatever lies within, or to leave it sealed and return to the world as you knew it.

What will you do?
