...reach out to take their hands, and as soon as your fingers touch, gravity seems to lose its hold.

The gray pavement beneath your feet dissolves into a river of flowing starlight. We don't walk; we glide. The towering skyscrapers around us soften, morphing into giant, swaying trees made of stained glass and whispering leaves. The noise of the traffic melts into a symphony of humming voices, a song I feel I’ve known my entire life but somehow forgot.

As we float through this canyon of light, I look at the strangers' faces. They keep changing—one moment they are people I knew in childhood, the next they are faceless figures made of warm clouds. They point forward, not to a street or a station, but toward a giant, golden door floating in the sky between the buildings.

I realize I don't need a map anymore. The fear evaporates, replaced by the sensation that I was never actually lost; I was just waiting to remember how to fly. We pass through the golden door, and I wake up with a lingering feeling of warmth in my chest.
