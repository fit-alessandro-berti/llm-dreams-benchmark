You are dreaming. This world shimmers around you - a pulsating amethyst mountain melts into a citrus-yellow river that, just then, sharpens into a spangled line of obsidian blocks. Above, the sky breathes, swirls of crimson and emerald chasing each other like startled birds. It feels warm and yet profoundly disquieting, this shift and flux. 

As you explore, weaving cautiously around a blossoming spiral of cobalt petals that were a jagged square moments ago, you come across a blank canvas. It seems utterly ridiculous, a static, *stable* thing, in this chaos reigning supreme. It's suspended from the constantly reforming branches of a pearlescent tree - a tree that currently resembles something vaguely like a playful jellyfish, tendrils gently bumping your shoulder. 

The canvas isn’s rectangular, though. Its form isn't even immediately recognizable. It feels… responsive. As I look at it, the emptiness begins to warp slightly, mimicking the fluid geometry of the surrounding dream-scape.  Then, it ripples outward, almost inviting me closer. 

Fear and an impossible pull mingle in my stomach. I reach out, tentatively. As my fingers brush its pristine surface, they don't feel solid. Instead, they sink in. 

Immediately, the canvas *reconfigures* again, mirroring the feeling of my fingertip, subtly. Where my hand pressed, a small patch of the dream-scape *materializes*. First, it's just a swirling haze of silver – then gradually coalescing – forming a perfect, miniature hummingbird, emerald feathers buzzing slightly, it hovers as if observing me, a single, curious eye shimmering sapphire blue. 

I stare, stunned, and, without conscious thought, imagine a feeling of quiet – the serene stillness of a lake mirroring moonlight. The canvas ripples again. This time, it expands further – the turquoise mirror forming now takes up an entire section of the sky, calm and perfectly reflective. I can see *myself* mirrored in the lake, a fleeting image shifting with every subtle ripple of the dream.

Emboldened I feel an urge to push further. I focus with all my attention imagining… stories. Not just visuals and feelings, but the feeling of narrative, of character, of resolution. I picture a little girl, gathering wild orchids, in an emerald meadow. With a rush of colors and textures the meadow blooms out of the canvas, vibrant and impossibly perfect. She dances in the petals, her laughing bright as sunshine, her clothes woven from threads of gold.

The hummingbird, seeing this new emergence, suddenly dives downward and begins to collect flower nectar, a trail of glittering gold dusting the air.  But something's *shifted*. A crack, hairline thin and violet, has appeared at the edges of my miniature world. And from the crack, I begin to perceive a faint, melancholy song... It feels…unfinished. Like this perfect dream world needs something I haven’t yet created. A struggle, a challenge... 

The violet crack continues to extend… threatening to overwhelm the girl and the meadow…and the hummingbird… 

Is this a mirror? Or an open window *to* something? 



The dream begins fading at the edges, a swirling grayscale vortex… and the blank canvas…. it’s slowly shrinking... back into nothingness...




...leaving me to wake up, with the distinct, inexplicable feeling that I was just on the brink of something important.....
