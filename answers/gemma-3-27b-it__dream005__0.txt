...and each group seems to be engaged in a *very* specific, and slightly unsettling, hobby.

The ballroom was enormous, all glittering chandeliers and swirling gowns, but the music was…off. Not bad, exactly, but like a slightly warped record, perpetually on the verge of skipping. I was desperately scanning for Amelia, the one friend who’d dragged me to this “Annual Society of Curious Collectors” event. She’d promised it would be “interesting,” but hadn’t mentioned *how* interesting.

I rounded a cluster of velvet ropes and nearly collided with a group meticulously arranging miniature porcelain teeth on a tiered cake stand. They weren’t dental models, these were…individual teeth, each painted with tiny, unsettlingly realistic gums. One woman, with a magnifying glass perched on her nose, was arguing vehemently about the proper placement of a molar.

“No, no, Beatrice! The occlusion is all wrong! It needs to *bite* into the incisor!”

I mumbled an apology and hurried on, feeling a prickle of unease.  Further on, I found a circle of people intensely focused on…knitting with human hair. Not yarn that *looked* like hair, actual strands of different colors and textures, being transformed into elaborate, lacy shawls.  A man with a particularly impressive grey braid wound around his finger offered me a strand.

“Lovely texture, isn’t it?  This one’s a particularly fine specimen.  From a retired opera singer, you know.  Holds the music, they say.”

I politely declined, backing away slowly.  Each group was more bizarre than the last.  A team was building a replica of the Eiffel Tower entirely out of bottle caps. Another was engaged in a competitive staring contest with a collection of taxidermied squirrels.  And then there was the group meticulously cataloging the dust bunnies found under antique furniture, assigning each one a Latin name and detailed description.

Panic started to bubble in my chest. Where *was* Amelia?  I called her name, but my voice felt swallowed by the strange, humming energy of the room.  

Suddenly, I bumped into someone.  I turned, bracing for another encounter with a peculiar hobbyist, but it wasn’t a person. It was a…giant, sentient teacup.  It wobbled slightly, its porcelain surface gleaming, and a voice, surprisingly deep and resonant, emanated from within.

“Lost, are we?  Looking for someone?  Everyone here is looking for something…a missing button, a forgotten memory, the perfect shade of beige.  But what are *you* looking for?”

The teacup tilted, and I saw, swirling within its depths, not tea, but a miniature replica of the ballroom itself, complete with all the strange collectors.  And in the center of that miniature ballroom, I saw Amelia…not talking to anyone, but *conducting* the warped music with a tiny silver spoon.  She looked…completely at home.



And then, the teacup winked.



I woke up with a jolt, the warped music still echoing faintly in my ears.
