wake up early to gather resources for survival. The sun is just beginning to rise, casting long shadows across the landscape. You find yourself in what appears to be a small village, its thatched-roof huts clustered together. The air smells of wood smoke and earth, and the sounds of animals and distant chatter fill the morning.

As you stand there, disoriented, you notice people moving about their daily routines—some tending to livestock, others preparing tools for the day’s work. You realize you have no idea where you are or how you got here, but one thing is clear: you need to adapt quickly if you’re going to survive.

Your first priority is food and water. You see a nearby stream, its surface shimmering in the early light. You head toward it, cupping your hands to scoop up some water. It’s cool and refreshing, but you know you can’t rely on this alone. You’ll need to find something more substantial to eat.

The village seems peaceful enough, but you don’t want to draw unnecessary attention. You decide to observe from a distance before approaching anyone. You spot a garden outside one of the huts, filled with unfamiliar plants. Some of them look edible, but you’re not sure which ones are safe. You’ll need to be cautious.

As you wander further, you come across a group of villagers working in a field. They’re using simple farming tools—hoes, sickles, and baskets. You watch them for a while, trying to learn from their movements. One of them notices you and approaches, looking curious but not hostile. 

“Stranger,” they say, “where did you come from?”

You hesitate, unsure of how much to reveal. Instead, you ask, “I’m new here. Could you show me how to find food and water? I don’t want to be a burden.”

They nod thoughtfully. “We can help, but you must learn to fend for yourself eventually. Come, follow me.”

They lead you to a nearby grove where wild berries grow in abundance. They teach you which ones are safe to eat and which to avoid. You also learn how to identify edible roots and leaves. The villagers are kind, but they make it clear that you must contribute to the community if you wish to stay.

As the day progresses, you begin to understand the rhythms of this world. You help with tasks like gathering firewood and tending to animals. In return, you’re given a place to sleep in one of the huts, a bowl of stew, and a sense of belonging.

But as night falls, you lie awake, wondering how long you’ll stay in this time, and whether you’ll ever find your way back to your own era. For now, though, you focus on the present, on learning and adapting, and on building a life in this strange, yet strangely familiar, world.
