...written in ancient hieroglyphs that shift and morph like living tattoos on the paper. Your heart races as you stare at them, pencil hovering uselessly over the blank answer sheet. The proctor, who looks suspiciously like your childhood goldfish but with the mustache of a 19th-century philosopher, clears his throat and announces, "Time starts now. Remember, the fate of galaxies depends on your multiple-choice selections."

Panic surges. You flip through the pages desperately. Question 1: *Depict the emotional trajectory of a raindrop falling from a cloud shaped like your ex's regrets.* Options A through D are doodles—squiggly lines that whisper secrets when you lean in close. You pick B, the one that tastes like regret and espresso, and suddenly the room tilts. Desks slide across the floor like icebergs in a fever dream, colliding with a chorus of chalkboard screeches.

The girl next to you—wait, is that your future self, with hair made of circuit boards?—giggles and hands you a cheat sheet. It's a grocery list: *Milk, quantum entanglement, three regrets, unicorn tears.* You scribble it down as your answer to Question 2: *Solve for X in the equation of why cats knock things off tables.* Boom—the paper ignites in harmless, rainbow flames, and the fire spells out "Correct!" in cursive smoke.

But then the questions evolve. They crawl off the page, tiny ink spiders skittering up your arms, demanding: *What color is Tuesday in binary? Recite the periodic table backward while juggling existential dread.* Your mind fractures into fractals, each shard replaying forgotten memories— that time you ate cereal for dinner in college, the scent of rain on hot asphalt, the way your dog used to chase shadows like they owed him money.

The clock melts into a Salvador Dalí puddle, dripping seconds onto the floor. You stand, shouting answers at the ceiling: "42! Schrödinger's cat is just hangry! And love is a glitch in the matrix!" The proctor nods approvingly, his fish eyes twinkling. "Outstanding. You've passed. Or have you? Wake up."

You jolt awake in your bed, sheets tangled like exam bluebooks, heart pounding. The alarm blares—it's just another Tuesday. But on your nightstand, a single Post-it note: *Hieroglyphs optional. Keep dreaming big.*
