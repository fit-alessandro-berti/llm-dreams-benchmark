**Dream Continuation:**

You decide to venture toward the rumored Sanctuary of Echoes, a place whispered about by scavengers around dwindling campfires. Legends say it’s a bastion of green in the ashen wastes, where water flows clean and the air doesn’t scorch the lungs. Your pack holds a rusted canteen, a knife, and a map etched on frayed cloth—your most precious relic.  

The sun bleeds orange through toxic clouds as you trek across a shattered highway. Rusted cars, long stripped of parts, stretch like skeletons. Your throat burns, but you ration the canteen, counting sips. Suddenly, a groan cuts through the wind. Behind a derelict truck, a figure lies crumpled—a woman, her leg trapped under debris. Her eyes lock onto yours, equal parts desperation and defiance.  

**Choice:** Do you help? Resources are precious, time is danger… but her jacket bears the symbol of the Sanctuary—a phoenix rising. You heave the rubble aside, sharing a sip of water. She murmurs gratitude and warns, "The Sanctuary’s real, but the path’s a maze. The Scourge guards it—not beasts, but men. They worship the old world’s greed."  

Together, you navigate blighted forests, where trees twist into claw-like shapes. Nights are spent in hollows, trading stories. Her name is Lys, a botanist who fled the Sanctuary’s tyrannical enclave. "They hoard seeds, control growth… it’s not salvation, it’s a cage," she rasps. You dream of a glowing tree that night, its roots pulsing like veins, whispering, *"True refuge is woven, not taken."*  

At dawn, you reach a valley. Below, the Sanctuary’s walls gleam, but armed figures patrol. Lys grips your arm. "We could burn their stores, free the seeds—let the land reclaim itself." Or sneak in, blend with the crowd, and survive. The dream’s edges waver, the sky flickering between void-black and dawn-gold.  

**The Final Image:** You grip a seed pouch Lys smuggled to you. The world trembles—is the ground shaking, or is it your waking mind tugging back? As the dream dissolves, the seed sprouts in your palm, a single green shoot piercing the dust. You don’t know if you’ll wake to ruin or rebirth… but for now, the choice is *yours*.

The dream ends here, lingering in the liminal space between sacrifice and hope, leaving you to wonder: Will the Sanctuary bloom or burn?
