...and the wind immediately begins to howl, whipping the branches into a frantic dance. The peaceful dappled light of the canopy is instantly snuffed out, replaced by a bruised, heavy purple that smells intensely of ozone.

I look up just as the first enormous drops of rain—drops the size of coins—splatter on the mossy ground. A deep, resonating crack of thunder shakes the earth, and I realize this is not a shower; it is a violent, primal breaking of the sky.

My body moves before I consciously decide to, and I sprint, pushing through thick ferns and brambles. I am desperately searching for any natural shelter, a dip in the ground, an overhang.

Then, through the curtain of gathering rain, I see it: a massive, ancient standing stone, almost completely overgrown, with a dark, narrow recess at its base. It looks less like a cave and more like the hollowed-out root cavity of a forgotten god.

I slide headlong into the opening just as the storm unleashes its full fury.

The moment I cross the threshold, the deafening roar of the storm is entirely silenced. It is not muffled; it is *gone*. The contrast is so absolute that my ears ache from the sudden, profound quiet.

I push myself up, breathing heavily, but the air inside the hollow is cool and utterly still, smelling faintly of clean, dry dust.

I realize I am not in a simple root cavity. The space opens up behind me into a vast, cathedral-like chamber. The walls are not made of rock or soil, but of perfectly smooth, polished obsidian that seems to absorb all light, yet simultaneously holds a deep, internal shimmer.

In the very center of the chamber, supported by nothing, floats a sphere of water. It is about ten feet across, suspended in the air like a perfect, trembling bubble, reflecting the smooth obsidian floor beneath it. It glows with a faint, pulsing emerald light.

As I slowly approach the floating orb, drawn by the soundless light, I realize the water isn't moving. It’s impossible, heavy, and perfectly spherical. And then, I see what is within it.

Swimming slowly in the crystal sphere are thousands of tiny, glowing golden fish, each leaving a shimmering, comet-like tail behind it. They are circling, tracing constellations inside their aqueous prison. They are completely silent, moving in a timeless, deliberate orbit.

I reach out a hesitant hand toward the water, half expecting it to explode or collapse. But as my fingers draw near, the air between my hand and the sphere suddenly ripples, and the fish pause in their endless circling.

The sphere of water begins to descend, slowly, until it settles perfectly onto the obsidian floor, transforming instantly into a solid, cold disc of polished jade. The fish are gone, replaced by an etched map of stars I have never seen.

I look back toward the entrance, but the opening is closed now. There is no trace of the storm outside—only solid, black stone behind me.

I am alone in the silent chamber, standing before a newly formed jade map of impossible constellations, and I know, with the strange certainty only dreams provide, that I have not taken shelter from the storm, but have instead walked directly into the heart of the sky it was trying to hide.

Suddenly, one of the etched stars on the jade map blazes white hot, and a whisper, which seems to originate not from a voice but from the vibration of the ground itself, echoes:

**"Welcome back. You were missed."**
