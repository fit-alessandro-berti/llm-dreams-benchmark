…each group seems to be in the middle of its own tiny universe.

First you drift toward the kitchen because kitchens always feel like they’re allowed to be loud. A circle of people is arguing—earnestly, politely—about something that should be simple, like the correct way to cut a sandwich. They keep demonstrating with invisible knives in the air, hands slicing through nothing, and every time someone reaches for an actual loaf of bread it vanishes from the counter as if the house itself is offended by proof. You laugh to show you’re friendly, but the laugh comes out a beat late, like it had to travel a long hallway before it reached your mouth. No one notices. Someone presses a napkin into your palm like it’s an invitation or a warning. When you unfold it, there’s a smudged map drawn in pen—only it isn’t a map of the house; it’s a map of your attention. Arrows point to things like “LISTENING,” “WAITING,” “ALMOST THERE.”

You move on.

In the living room, a cluster of people are playing a party game that doesn’t have rules, only rituals. They keep handing one another small objects—button, coin, key, pebble—and each time an object changes hands, the room shifts subtly, furniture sliding an inch like tectonic plates. A man in a sweater vest holds out a key to you as if you’ve been expected. When you take it, it’s warm, like it’s been in someone’s pocket for years. He says, very clearly, “This opens the hallway that wasn’t here a minute ago,” and everyone nods as if this is ordinary conversation. You turn, and sure enough: a thin door stands where there had been blank wall.

You don’t remember deciding to open it, but you do.

Behind it is a hallway with the wrong kind of distance—too long for the size of the house, stretching like a thought you can’t finish. The light is dim and amber, and the carpet has the pattern of shallow water. You walk, and your footsteps sound like pages turning. Along the walls are framed photographs from the gathering, except the pictures show you in places you haven’t been yet: you laughing with strangers, you leaning close to someone’s shoulder, you finding your friend near a window. In every photo, your face is slightly blurred, as if the camera couldn’t decide who you are.

Halfway down the hall, you hear your name spoken in the exact voice of the one person you know. Relief snaps through you so sharply it almost hurts. You quicken your pace.

The hallway empties you into a room you don’t recognize, though it feels familiar in the way a childhood smell feels familiar. The room is filled with people standing very still, as if someone said “freeze” and never said anything else. Their eyes are directed toward the center, where a record player spins without a record. The needle drags across nothing, making a soft, constant hush.

At the center is your friend.

Only it’s not quite your friend—more like the idea of them assembled from the details you remember: their posture, the tilt of their head, the way they hold their hands when they’re listening. They look up when you approach, and their face brightens with the exact expression you’ve been searching for all night.

“You found me,” they say.

You step forward, and the people around you exhale in unison, like an audience released from suspense. The room warms. Colors deepen. Sound returns in layers—the clink of ice, a distant laugh, the low rumble of conversation, music you didn’t notice until now. You feel the tension in your shoulders loosen, like a knot sliding undone.

“I’ve been trying,” you say, and the words feel true in a way waking life words sometimes don’t.

Your friend nods and holds up their hand. Wrapped around their wrist is a thin ribbon, the kind you get at events to prove you belong. You notice your own wrist is bare.

“You’re not checked in,” they say gently, as if this is a small administrative thing and not the central mystery of the universe. “That’s why everything keeps changing when you look away.”

They reach behind them and produce another ribbon. It’s the same color as the napkin map—pale, almost white, with a faint sheen. They tie it around your wrist with practiced fingers.

The moment the knot tightens, the room clicks into place. The record player stops hissing. The frozen people blink and begin to move again, each returning to their own conversation as if no pause ever happened. Someone laughs too loudly near the door. Someone drops a glass and it doesn’t break, it just bounces once and rolls like a marble. The house breathes, settling.

Your friend takes your hand—not urgently, just firmly, the way you hold on to someone in a crowd so you don’t drift apart.

“Come on,” they say. “I want to show you something.”

They lead you through the room and toward a window that’s been covered by heavy curtains. As you get closer, you can hear something outside: not traffic, not wind, but a kind of vast, patient sound, like the ocean heard from far away. Your friend pulls the curtain aside.

Instead of a backyard or a street, there’s a night sky that goes down as well as up. Stars below your feet, constellations under the lawn. The world outside is an inverted dome, and the house is balanced on nothing at all. The gathering continues behind you—warm, noisy, human—while beyond the glass is a quiet so large it feels alive.

“You don’t have to stay here,” your friend says. “You can, if you want. But you don’t have to.”

You look at the ribbon on your wrist. You can feel it, a small band of certainty. You look back at the room full of strangers who no longer seem quite as strange.

And then you realize what you’ve been looking for all along wasn’t just your friend. It was an anchor. A proof that you weren’t wandering alone through shifting rooms and half-rules.

Your friend squeezes your hand once, as if to say: decide.

Somewhere, faintly, a phone begins to ring—muffled, distant, insistent. The sound comes from the direction of the hallway that wasn’t there a minute ago. The stars outside the window flicker, as if reacting to it.

You open your mouth to answer your friend, but the words turn into breath, and your breath turns into the hush of the record player, and the hush turns into—

—into morning light on your eyelids.

Your wrist still feels like it’s wearing something.

When you open your eyes, the ribbon is gone.

But the knot, somehow, remains.
