You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to navigate the rigid social hierarchy of a feudal kingdom. The villagers speak in an archaic dialect, and your clothes mark you as an outsider. To avoid suspicion, you mimic their mannerisms and offer to fix their broken irrigation system using your knowledge of basic engineering. Your success earns you temporary trust, but whispers of a coming famine spread. You discover that an unjust tax demands all grain be sent to the lord’s castle, leaving the people to starve. Using your modern understanding of economics and resource management, you organize the villagers to store food secretly and barter with neighboring towns. As tensions rise, the lord’s soldiers come to investigate the “rebellion.” You must choose: flee to safety, risking the villagers’ lives, or stay and face the consequences of defying the system. In that moment, you realize this era is not just a test of survival—it’s a mirror, forcing you to confront how far you’d go to fight for justice in any time.  

As the soldiers approach, you rally the villagers to the hillside, where you’ve hidden sacks of grain and crafted crude but effective signal fires to mimic larger forces. The lord’s men, wary of a trap, retreat. The villagers cheer, but their gratitude feels bittersweet. You’ve altered the course of their history, yet you know your time here is borrowed. That night, you find a strange compass in the rubble of an old mill—its needle spins wildly until it locks onto a star you don’t recognize. When you touch it, the world dissolves into light.  

You awaken in your bed, the compass gone, but the scent of damp earth and the echo of villagers’ voices linger. On your desk, a single parchment lies: a hand-drawn map of the kingdom, annotated with notes in your own handwriting. The dream feels too vivid to dismiss. You realize now—it wasn’t just a dream. It was a call.
