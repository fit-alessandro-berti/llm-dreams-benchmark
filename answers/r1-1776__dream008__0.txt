…feel your chest tighten as the clock on the wall ticks louder, each second stretching into a heartbeat. Your boss leans over your desk, their shadow swallowing your keyboard. "This needs to be perfect," they say, tapping a pen against a stack of papers that weren’t there a moment ago. The deadline? Yesterday. The project? A blur of spreadsheets, code, and client demands written in a language that flickers like static when you try to read it.  

Your hands hover over the keyboard, but the keys keep rearranging themselves—numbers become symbols, then hieroglyphs. The office around you warps: fluorescent lights buzz like hornets, your coworkers’ voices melt into white noise, and the walls creep inward. You open your mouth to ask for help, but your voice is gone.  

Suddenly, your screen glows blindingly bright. A single sentence appears: **"Compile the paradox."** You type frantically, not knowing what it means, but your fingers move autonomously, weaving logic from chaos. The clock’s hands spin backward. Your boss’s face fractures into a mosaic of expressions—anger, pride, fear.  

Just as you hit "send," the project dissolves into confetti. The office floor cracks open, and you’re falling—until you jolt awake, drenched in sweat, your phone buzzing with a deadline reminder… for a task that doesn’t exist.
