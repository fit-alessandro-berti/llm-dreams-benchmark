You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you feel the old, familiar tremor of destiny settle against the hull, as if the waves themselves are humming a question to your hands.

The sky above becomes a churning bruise of violet and bruised metal, with lightning that flickers in slow, deliberate breaths. The wind, relentless, is a choir of unseen fingers, each tugging at a line, each call answered in a hiss of steel. Your crew, small silhouettes against the dark, stir in a shared hush, their eyes wide, searching for a beacon in the gloom.

You breathe deeply, and the sound is a metronome that steadies the ship. With each inhale, a hidden rope slides into position; a new rope, a command whispered into the creaking galley of the compass. The galaxy of stars flickers far below the horizon, and in the throat of the great swell, you sense a pulse—an echo, a memory of the first voyage when the sea roared and you were sure you could steer it whole-heartedly into the storm.

You grip the wheel with a force that doesn’t seem like force at all, as if you’re laying a hand upon the very skin of the sea. A new thought, wild and bright, flashes in your mind: the storm is no longer opposition, but revelation. You look to your crew and see their form waver in the reflection of the overhead waves; the world's image dissolves into a watercolor of canvases that bleed into one another. You meet their eyes and, through the blinding eyes of the storm, you offer them the one thing they need—an unshakable calm from within.

Without hesitation you order: “Cut the anchor,” you say. The hull shudders, and a rustle of loose sails fills the air. The wind roars a different note now—as if the contours of the ship have moved in harmony with the rhythm of the heavens. The arms of the sea extend around the vessel like a giant, gentle embrace. The crew follows your lead, windwise, each stroke a rhythmic pulse that unites their breathing with your own. Their grip tightens, but the spirit flickers, for you have steadied them in a liquid moment.

A figure of light breaks through the clouds—a wayward fish of moonlight, li­ght as a silver comet, dancing between the waves. The fish glides slowly, its tail dripping a gleaming stream of starlight, weaving a path through the white foam as if painting a path for your ship.

You feel a tug once more, a shift at the very core of the storm itself. The waves, hot and furious, begin to fold over themselves against an unseen tide. The darkness of the sky brightens, and glimpses of arcs of translucent colors—turquoise, lavender, amber—appear, swirling like an ancient whirlpool that lifts up the surface of the sea, revealing tints of deep-sea turquoise as far as the eye can see.

The rest of the crew, who once trembled, now see this unfolding, and the collective breath of the ship becomes a calm thread threading from the heart of the storm to the lighthouse of the horizon. The gulls, that once mirrored only the wind’s memory, fold into a graceful band, echoing your instinctive, bold steering—till they are swallowed by a silken, breezy braid, and their cries turn into the song of the tiny wind that grazes the horizon's edge.

Your heartbeat rises as the storm’s roar turns into a lullaby. The chapter of the tempest, once unevitable, now fades, because you have decided that a storm is nothing but a soap bubble that is ready to be painted with hope, and you host the paintball in that morning sky that will catch the wind—that which is the only eternal truth in the ship’s heart: you are a captain for one who guides rather than commands.

When the moon's silver lantern looks upon you, the sea finally gives respite, a sea that can be a dream or a day, only determined by the people on the ship. Your crewmates find their calm, and one past-ace of a thought is born from the storm: you are as much part of that storm as you are simply a ship that lies there in the heart of that turbulent sea.

Your hair, wet with spray, sings to your ears, the waves a tender breath. And as the storm calms, you feel your heartbeat aligning with the pulse of the sea; the ship loves the calm after its birth, and you, the captain, feel the peaceful wind as come into relief, the thrumming of swirling of the world appears, and the ocean lifts to its own song of shimmering light.

The dream fades to a new dawn, a new style of ocean winds awaken the ship and its crew, a reminder that a calm end is ‘just another in the wind.’ The storm ends, and in the calm, your heart is steady and your ship true—ready again to sail, again to abide in your personal star, a true captain for all yes.
