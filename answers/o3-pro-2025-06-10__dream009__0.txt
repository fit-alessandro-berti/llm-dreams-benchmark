…figure out three things fast: where you are, who you can trust, and how to stay alive until sunrise.

You step onto a muddy lane that winds between timber-framed cottages. The air smells of peat smoke and wet earth, and in the distance a church bell clangs the hour—seven strokes. People in rough wool pass you, eyes lowered, clutching baskets of turnips and bundles of kindling. They stare at your strange clothes—cotton tee, elastic waistbands, neon running shoes—so you tear off the shirt’s printed tag, turn it inside out, and pull a tattered cloak from a nearby clothesline. The owner shouts, but a passing oxcart splashes through a puddle, drowning out her curses as you disappear into the crowd.

1. Find out where you are.  
A faded proclamation nailed to the tavern door proclaims the reign of “King Æthelric, Year of Grace 1124.” Medieval England—early Norman period, if your half-remembered history classes are right. Carriages are scarce, literacy scarcer. You quickly note the language: Middle English mingled with Old Norse loanwords. You practice under your breath: “Gōd dæg, friend.”

2. Identify allies.  
Inside the tavern, smoky with tallow candles, you notice a lanky youth sketching constellations on a scrap of parchment. The diagram matches tonight’s sky perfectly. You compliment him in stumbling Middle English; his name is Wulfstan, an apprentice to the village “stargazer,” a healer-astronomer suspected of sorcery. Outsiders stick together, so you buy Wulfstan a mug of weak ale, trading your plastic wristwatch—“a sundial that works in darkness,” you claim—for information. He warns you the sheriff will arrive at dawn to arrest his master on witchcraft charges. You see a chance: if you save the astronomer, you might earn protection, maybe even a place to stay while you search for a route back home.

3. Survive the night.  
Wulfstan leads you to a low stone cottage at the edge of the woods. Inside, old scrolls cover every surface—star charts, herbal recipes, crude mechanical drawings. The astronomer, Osric, gaunt and wild-eyed, peers at you as if you were a comet: omen or opportunity. You explain in cautious fragments—“I hail from a far land where iron birds fly the skies.” He laughs, not disbelieving, merely delighted. He shows you his latest invention: a hollow metal sphere with a fuse—primitive fireworks. It’s meant to impress the local ealdorman, but in the wrong hands it looks like treason.

You propose a plan. At dawn, when the sheriff’s men arrive, Osric will ignite the sphere atop a nearby hill. The sudden thunderclap and burst of sparks will convince the townsfolk that heavenly powers guard him. Superstition is your ally tonight.

Dawn’s first light smears pink across the hills. You, Osric, and Wulfstan drag the contraption up the dew-slick slope. The sheriff’s horses clatter into the clearing below just as Osric touches the smoldering reed to the fuse. A hiss, a sputter—then silence. Misfire. The sheriff laughs, spurring his horse forward.

You sprint downhill, heart hammering, remembering a trick from high-school chemistry. Friction can finish what flame would not. You yank off your neon shoelace—polyester, flammable when frayed—and saw it viciously against the fuse. Sparks leap; the powder inside the sphere catches. You hurl the ball skyward. For a breathless moment it arcs like a slow planet. Then—BOOM! A burst of white light and rolling thunder shakes the valley. Horses rear; peasants shriek and cross themselves. The sheriff, pale, orders his men to retreat. “The heavens speak for the sage!” someone cries.

Osric is safe—for now. He clasps your forearm. “You are a traveler between stars and centuries,” he whispers. “I will help you seek your road home.”

As evening falls again, you sit outside the cottage. Wulfstan hands you fresh parchment, goose-quill, and a challenge: “Draw the world you came from.” You sketch skyscrapers, airplanes, satellites. Osric studies the drawing, eyes glittering. “If time is a river,” he says, “perhaps knowledge is the boat.”

The dream starts to fade—the campfire, the cool night, the far murmuring fields. You feel the tug of your own century pulling you back. Osric’s voice echoes as everything blurs: “Remember, traveler—ideas outlive their makers.”

You gasp awake in your own bed, smartphone buzzing on the nightstand. But your neon shoelace is missing, and a fleck of strange, ancient parchment lies on your pillow, smelling faintly of woodsmoke and stars.
