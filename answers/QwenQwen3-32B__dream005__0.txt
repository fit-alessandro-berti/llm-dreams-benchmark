You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and...  

...and the room itself seems to breathe. Chandeliers hover without wires, their crystals humming in dissonant harmony. A cluster of guests in Victorian-era attire stands in a circle, all laughing—but their mouths are sealed with golden thread, soundless. When you approach, one turns to you, eyes wide and pleading, and suddenly *you* are the one laughing, a creaky, mechanical sound that isn’t yours. You stagger back, and the thread on their lips dissolves into moths.  

Further in, a corridor of mirrors splits the crowd. Each reflection shows not your face, but fragments of the person you’re searching for—their hand waving from one pane, their eyes flickering in another. You reach out, but the glass warps, pulling you into a hallway that loops backward. You pass the same guests twice: a group of floating children stacking upside-down birthday cakes, their laughter echoing from below; a debate circle where participants speak only in riddles, their words materializing as birds that scatter into ink.  

Then, a door materializes where there was none before. It’s carved with your name. Beyond it, a garden of upside-down trees roots into the sky, and there they are—sitting on a branch, smiling. But as you climb toward them, the trunk twists into a spiral staircase, and their voice echoes, layered and distant: *“You already knew how to find me. You just forgot to look where the maze ends.”*  

When you reach them, the party vanishes. You’re alone on a beach, holding a seashell that pulses like a heartbeat. Somewhere, a wave washes ashore, and in its foam, the outline of a familiar face briefly rises before dissolving into sand. You smile, or maybe sigh, and the dream tilts—gravity flipping as you wake, still clutching the shell, unsure if you’ve found what you were seeking or lost something else.
