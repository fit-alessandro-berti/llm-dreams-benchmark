written in a language you’ve never seen before—swirling symbols that seem to shift and rearrange themselves as you stare at them. The room around you begins to warp, the walls stretching like taffy, and the other students dissolve into shadows. A voice whispers, *"The answers are not in the words, but in the spaces between them."*

Suddenly, the exam paper bursts into flames, but instead of burning, the fire forms into a glowing path leading to a door at the back of the room. The door creaks open, revealing a vast, star-filled void. A figure steps forward—it’s your future self, holding out a hand. *"The test was never about what you know,"* they say, *"but whether you’re ready to step into the unknown."*

Do you take their hand? Or do you turn back to the smoldering exam, trying to decipher the shifting symbols one last time?

(How would you like the dream to end?)
