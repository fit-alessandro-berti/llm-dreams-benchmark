Of course. This feels so real...

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to find a source of clean water. The sun is high, and a deep thirst has taken root in your throat.

The air smells of dust, woodsmoke, and something else... animal dung. You're crouched behind a rough-hewn wooden cart, its wheels solid but crude. Peering around its edge, you see a dirt street rutted with wagon tracks. People, dressed in coarse wool and linen tunics, move with a purpose you don't understand. Their speech is a foreign melody, a clamor of guttural sounds and sharp vowels you can't decipher.

Your heart hammers against your ribs. *Where am I? When am I?* Panic starts to bubble up, but you force it down. Panic is a luxury.

A woman walks by, balancing a clay jug on her hip. Water. She has water. You need to follow her, to see where she got it. You mimic the way people walk, trying to blend in, your modern clothes feeling like a bizarre costume. You get a few odd looks, a furrowed brow, but no one stops you.

She leads you to the edge of the settlement, where the packed earth gives way to a well-trodden path leading into a grove of trees. And then you hear it. The beautiful, life-giving sound of running water. A stream.

You hurry forward, forgetting caution, and drop to your knees at the water's edge. You cup your hands, ready to drink, but you stop. A memory, distant as the world you came from, surfaces: *Giardia. Dysentery. Bacteria.*

You can't just drink it. You need to find a way to boil it. You need fire.

As you sit back on your heels, despair washing over you, a shadow falls across the stream. You look up. A young girl, no more than ten, stands there. She has a kind, curious face, smudged with dirt, and she holds a small, empty bucket. She looks at your strange clothes, your clean hands, your desperate eyes.

She says something in that melodic, incomprehensible tongue. You just stare, helpless. She tilts her head, then points to your mouth, then to the water, and shakes her head vigorously. *No.* She pantomimes drinking, then clutches her stomach and pretends to be sick.

She knows.

Then she points to herself, taps her chest, and says, "Aelia." She points to you, a question in her eyes.

You manage to say your name.

She smiles, a bright flash in a world of uncertainty. She gestures for you to follow. She isn't leading you back to the village, but further along the stream, to a small, tidy hut nestled against the tree line. An old woman sits outside, grinding grain on a stone.

Aelia speaks to her rapidly, pointing at you and the stream. The old woman looks you up and down, her eyes sharp and knowing. She doesn't seem surprised. She simply nods, gets up with a grunt, and retrieves a fired clay cup from inside the hut. She dips it into a large pot sitting by the door—a pot you suddenly realize is steaming slightly over the cold ashes of a fire. Boiled water.

She hands you the cup. It's warm. You drink. It's the most profound, most delicious thing you have ever tasted. It isn't just water; it is safety. It is trust. It is a thread of connection to this strange new world.

You have your water. But as you hand the cup back, your stomach rumbles loudly. The old woman and Aelia laugh. The dream shifts, the immediate crisis solved, but a new, more profound journey is just beginning. You realize your next need is to find a way to communicate, to earn your keep, and to understand the rules of this place you now call home.
