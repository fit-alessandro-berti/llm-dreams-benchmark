...open your mouth, but instead of words your breath comes out in shimmering soap bubbles that float lazily up to the rafters. The microphone in your hand bends and blossoms into a white lily. You look down and realize that you are barefoot, standing not on a wooden stage but on a surface of warm sand. The rows of faces in front of you ripple like heat mirages and melt away, replaced by a horizon of calm blue water.

For a heartbeat you panic — you had something important to say — but the panic dissolves as the first of your bubble‑words touches the ceiling and bursts into soft rain. The audience raises their hands and catches it, laughing like children. Someone in the front row, who now looks suspiciously like your third‑grade teacher, gives you a thumbs‑up.

You clear your throat. This time a flock of small, bright birds pours from between your teeth and arcs above the crowd. They carry your message better than you ever could. You watch them go, feeling lighter and lighter until you are rising with them, lifted by an invisible breeze, the stage shrinking beneath you.

Somewhere far below, applause and the sound of waves blend together. You realize you never had to remember the speech at all — you just had to let go. As you drift toward the skylight, the light grows warmer against your skin, and you wake up with the echo of the ocean still in your ears.
