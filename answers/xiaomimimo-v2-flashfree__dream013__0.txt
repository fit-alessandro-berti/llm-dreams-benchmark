...feel the air grow thicker, humming with a low, vibrating frequency that seems to resonate inside your very bones. The walls, once cold stone, now pulse with a faint, bioluminescent glow, shifting colors from deep indigo to electric violet with each beat of your heart.

The puzzle before you is no longer static. It is a **Living Labyrinth of Light.**

**The Current Puzzle: The Prism of Intent**

You stand in a circular chamber. In the center floats a crystalline prism, suspended by nothing. Six beams of colored light converge on it from the walls, but the prism remains dark.

*   **Red Beam:** Pulse Rate: Fast (Anxiety/Fear)
*   **Blue Beam:** Pulse Rate: Slow (Calm/Sadness)
*   **Green Beam:** Flickering (Confusion/Chaos)
*   **Yellow Beam:** Steady (Hope/Clarity)
*   **Purple Beam:** Dim (Hidden Knowledge)
*   **White Beam:** Absent (The Goal)

**The Logic:**
You realize this isn't a math problem; it is a test of emotional control. The maze is reading your mind. To activate the White Beam, you must synthesize the opposing colors into pure light.

1.  **Focus on the Red Beam (Fear).** Do not fight it. Acknowledge it. Then, push your mind to find the logic within the fear. Visualize the Red and Blue beams intertwining. The anxiety of the Red slows down; the sorrow of the Blue speeds up. They merge, swirling into a violent **Violet**.
2.  **Now, the Green (Chaos).** It is erratic, blinding your thoughts. You must introduce the **Yellow (Clarity)**. Imagine a strict grid overlaying the flickering green. Force the chaos into a pattern. The green stops flickering and holds a solid, deep Teal.
3.  **The Final Synthesis.** You now have **Violet** (Fear + Logic) and **Teal** (Chaos + Order). You guide these two beams toward the center. They strike the prism simultaneously.

The prism shatters, not into debris, but into a cascade of blinding **White Light**. The White Beam finally ignites, cutting a path through the wall ahead.

The wall dissolves, revealing what lies deeper in the maze. You see a hallway lined with mirrors, but the mirrors do not show your reflection. They show **you, but at different ages**.

**What do you do next?**
