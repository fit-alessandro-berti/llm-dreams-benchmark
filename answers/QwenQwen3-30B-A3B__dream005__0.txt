You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and...  

The room shifts like a mirage—what was once a ballroom now stretches into a labyrinth of floating platforms, each tethered by glowing threads that hum with forgotten melodies. You step carefully, your shoes making no sound on the air. A group of strangers hovers nearby, their faces blurred as if seen through water. They speak in overlapping whispers, their words dissolving before they reach your ears. One leans closer, offering a glass of liquid that shimmers like mercury. You decline, and they dissolve into smoke, leaving behind a single feather that lands in your hand.  

Further in, you stumble upon a circle of dancers frozen mid-motion, their bodies twisted into impossible angles. Their laughter is a sound like wind through broken bells. You try to pass, but the floor beneath you ripens into a field of soft, glowing mushrooms. A child with too many eyes approaches, holding a compass that spins wildly. "They’re all around you," the child says, pointing to the ceiling, where silhouettes of people drift like bubbles. "But you’ll only find them if you stop looking."  

You press on, weaving through a crowd of faceless figures who pass you items: a key that fits no lock, a photograph of a place you’ve never been, a song written in a language of clicks and sighs. Then, a sudden silence. The room ahead is empty, save for a single door made of polished obsidian. Your breath fogs the surface as you reach for the handle, but it’s not there—only your reflection, staring back with someone else’s eyes.  

When you turn, the person you’ve been seeking is there, standing in the doorway of a hallway that wasn’t there before. They smile, but their mouth doesn’t move. You open your mouth to speak, and the dream fractures.  

You wake up clutching a feather, the echo of a song still humming in your bones.
