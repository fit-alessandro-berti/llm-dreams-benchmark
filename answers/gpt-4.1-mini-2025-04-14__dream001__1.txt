You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to walk briskly, your footsteps echoing on the cobblestone streets as towering buildings loom above you. The air is thick with the scent of rain and distant chatter. You glance around for a landmark or a sign, but the city seems both familiar and strange, as if it’s shifting subtly with every step you take.

Suddenly, a street vendor offers you a small, glowing map. It unfolds itself in your hands, showing a labyrinth of twisting alleys, floating bridges, and shimmering gateways. The destination is marked by a pulsating blue dot at the heart of the city. As you follow the map, the surroundings evolve—walls shimmer into translucent crystal, and the sky morphs from gray to a kaleidoscope of stars swirling above you.

The closer you get, the more you sense a chorus of whispers, encouraging and inviting. You turn a corner, and there it is: an ornate building with golden doors that open silently as you approach. Inside, the room is filled with people waiting, all smiling and nodding. You realize this meeting is more than just a business appointment—it’s a gathering of souls, a convergence of purpose.

Just then, the clock chimes, and you feel a calm certainty wash over you. Whatever happens next, you are exactly where you need to be.
