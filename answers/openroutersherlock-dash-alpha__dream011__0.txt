You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are all written in ancient hieroglyphs, glowing faintly like fireflies in the dim room. Panic rises as you realize you can't read them—but then your pencil begins to levitate, scribbling answers on its own in perfect English. Suddenly, the proctor morphs into a wise old dragon who winks and whispers, "The real test is trusting the dream." The paper dissolves into butterflies that carry you soaring through a candy-cloud sky, your career no longer a worry but a constellation of infinite possibilities. You wake up smiling, pencil still clutched in your hand.
