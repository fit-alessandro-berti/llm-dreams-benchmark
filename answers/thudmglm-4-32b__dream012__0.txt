...stand tall at the helm, gripping the wheel with weathered hands.

Your chest swells with a calmness that seems to cut through the howling wind and the spray that crashes against the deck. You scan the tumultuous waves, searching for the tell-tale signs of a break in the clouds, a fleeting moment of calmer water. The wind whips your hair and shouts at you, but you listen for the deeper currents, the rhythm of the sea beneath the chaos.

Your eyes lock onto each face of the crew clustered behind you, their expressions ranging from fear to desperate trust. You can hear their ragged breathing, the creak of the timber underfoot, the groan of the massive sails straining against the gale.

"You see that flash!" you call out, pointing towards the jagged edge of the turbulent water ahead. "We ride it! Full sail, lads! Bear off just a degree!" Your voice, though raised, remains steady, a beacon in the midst of the tempest. You watch as the First Mate immediately relayed the order, his own hands tight on a line, his face grim but resolute.

The ship banking, leaning sharply into the turn as if it knew your command. The deck tilts, threatening to spill men overboard, but the crew plants their feet, eyesFixed on you. You feel the collective power – the strong arms pulling on the ropes, the solid backs braced against the rails, the shared heartbeat of the vessel itself.

You guide the ship like an extension of your own body, anticipating the next crest, judging the safest path across the treacherous troughs. For every threatening wave that towers, you find the angle that lets the prow slice through, the moment to fall back to avoid being swamped.

The rain slashes down harder, but you don't flinch. Your mind is utterly focused – strategy, timing, the lives depending on your every decision. In this chaos, you feel strangely alive, a calculated peace mingling with the inherent danger. You are the thread holding them together, the only thing standing between this ship and being broken on the relentless waves.

You will not fail them. You will find the way through. You are the captain.
