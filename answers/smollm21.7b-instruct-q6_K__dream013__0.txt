continue working through each of them with the clarity and determination that defined your adventurous spirit while awake. You have spent countless hours studying various brain teasers from different fields such as psychology, physics, logic, and mathematics. Your goal was to increase the scope of puzzles that could challenge and satisfy your mind like no other source can.

As you navigated through thick shadows towards a light at the end of the maze - an elusive but promising solution for your current labyrinth-like situation - you noticed signs indicating several entrances leading out into different dimensions of perception. They were all adorned with various symbols: the Pythagorean triangle, binary code, fractals and some that looked like patterns based on the theory of relativity.

You quickly picked two signs up from different corners of the maze and held them in front of your eyes while continuing to unravel riddles given by those who placed you in this unique labyrinth for one reason or another: knowledge.

1. You see a number '27' appearing randomly, forming into an arithmetic operation. 
2. You recognize letters that form words with meaning which help interpret mathematical formulas involved within each set of symbols thus unraveling the mystery behind these multidimensional dimensions you are navigating across.

Upon using logic and combining both sets provided knowledge gained from two separate signs pointing towards different levels of understanding hidden patterns: 
1) The number 27 becomes 58 (by breaking the code related to numbers), which corresponds with a specific mathematical equation relevant to dimensional analysis mentioned in the equations given under the fractals.
2) Words "MULTIVERSE" & "WAVE FORCE", then relate directly to one another by finding connections among all parts presented since both deal with forces present across multiverses being considered here and their interaction properties, as well as how they influence perceptions when navigating through dimensions.
