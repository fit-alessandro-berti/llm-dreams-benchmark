You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **take a step back.  I feel the frantic thrumming in my chest calm slightly. The air crackles around us – a physical manifestation of frustration. Instead of blurting out another, likely scathing, response, I turn away abruptly, towards a wall covered in cascading bougainvillea. 

The petals are shockingly bright – vibrant fuchsia against cool, stucco gray. Each one feels hyperrealistic beneath my fingertips as I blindly touch a cascade of them.  Everything suddenly *moves*. Not abruptly, but in a slow, dizzying spin – the wall, my friend standing opposite me, even *my own feet.* It's like an elaborate film reel slowly disengaging. 

As the spinning slows, the scene resolves itself, but entirely different. I’d stepped out of the room – the argument forgotten – only to materialize in… a library?  Not a grand, intimidating library, but tucked inside a gingerbread house.  The walls are bookshelves, naturally, and the entire construction, smelling faintly of ginger molasses, glows from within.

Shelves crammed with antique maps twist and coil, each depicting fantastical lands – maps of cloud cities, bottomless valleys paved with amethyst, continents shaped entirely of melting ice cream. A ridiculously cheerful gnome sits perched on the highest shelf, meticulously cataloging scrolls while wearing spectacles glued crookedly on.

He looks up, cringing slightly. “Oh dear! Not another one escaping. Do be careful with these… arguments.” He points vaguely at a shimmering vortex emanating from a slightly out of alignment map of Greenland.  

"Arguments form portals. Feed on disagreement.  That 'Map of Greenland' is particularly volatile.  Led someone straight into a conversation about squirrels." He sighs, wiping flour (apparently he bakes in his spare time too).

I want to ask how, why *squirrels*, but the world begins to tilt again.  Another spin, this one faster, and suddenly I’m... dancing. 

Barefoot beneath a vast, starlitched sky, twirling, light and carefree, with *fifty* versions of your friend.  Each one wearing a shimmering tunic and silently urging my hands to connect, to turn from my rigidity. Not an attempt to resolve anything, but simply to feel the flow, to experience the *release.* 



I open my mouth to laugh, tears springing up in my eyes, a silly joyous bubble of nonsense taking over my mind. Then, just as abruptly, the dream dissolves. I wake with the lingering sensation of starlight on my skin and a vague, inexplicable urge to rephrase everything I felt in the moment into a haiku… about sparkly dancing friends.
