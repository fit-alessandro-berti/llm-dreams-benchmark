As the storm brews, the once-hushed forest pulses with restless energy—a whisper of wind and a drop of rain that threatens to erase the path ahead. I dodge through the storm’s fingers, my footsteps muffled by the sudden howls of wild animals. The sky, once a canvas of clouds and light, darkens with a storm cloud that threatens to swallow the light. Trees sway in protest, their leaves fluttering like alive insects. A single drop of rain falls from the sky, then another, illuminating my path. I clasp a hand over my eyes, the storm passing like an old ally. Now, I can turn back to the forest, knowing I’ve weathered the storm and its power—alive, unpredictable, and full of change.
