…freeze for a moment, your heart thumping so loudly you’re sure the entire office can hear it. The bright fluorescent lights of the cubicle maze above you warp and pulse like the interior of a heated kaleidoscope, while your boss’s face—so calm and expectant a moment ago—now stretches and frays at the edges, as though it’s being pulled through taffy.

You know you have to start, but when you flip open your laptop it’s gone blank—no operating system, no files, just the faint outline of a ticking clock where the screen’s glow should be. Panicking, you tap at the keys; each keystroke echoes like thunder down the aisles of cubicles. The chairs scuttle away from you, and the office plants sprout enormous roots that twine around your ankles, anchoring you in place.

Swiveling in your chair, you see your boss drifting across the sea of desks—no longer a person, but an expressionless silhouette made of winding corridors of paperwork. Behind them, tachometers spool out impossibly fast, their needle buried deep in the red. You’re supposed to deliver a full-scale project—perfectly designed, fully tested, ready to ship—by the close of business today. You glance at your watch: the hands have snapped off and now revolve like a merry-go-round.

Desperate, you shove your chair forward and sprint down the aisle; the floor tiles ripple under each footstep, dominoing into a wave that nearly unseats you. You fling yourself into the boss’s office—which has doubled in size and shifted into a glass-walled chamber floating above a yawning void—and slam a sheaf of blank pages on the desk. They flip open to reveal… nothing. A mocking gust of wind scatters them into the abyss below.

Heart pounding, you close your eyes. When you open them again, you’re back at your own desk. The glow of your real laptop greets you, screen filled with code and half-finished diagrams. The boss looms over your shoulder—solid, flesh‑and‑blood once more—but smiling gently.

“Ready to get started?” they ask, voice echoing like distant church bells.

You inhale deeply, your pulse finally slowing to a manageable rhythm. The impossible deadline still looms, but this time, with the taste of surreal terror fresh in your mind, you feel… oddly awake.
