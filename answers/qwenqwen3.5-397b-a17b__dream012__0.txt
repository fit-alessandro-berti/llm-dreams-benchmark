realize the wheel is warm, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath your palms. You stop shouting orders and instead begin to hum a lullaby your mother never sang. The sound ripples outward, visible as golden rings. Where the rings touch the waves, the churning water instantly turns to dry, white sand. The thunder softens into the rhythmic rumble of a distant train.

Your crew drops their ropes, their uniforms dissolving into loose threads that float away like dandelion seeds. You look down at your hands and see they are made of the same driftwood as the deck. The ship isn't sinking; it is taking root. The storm was just the world growing around you. You close your eyes, and when you open them, you are the lighthouse, standing still, watching the memory of the ship sail safely into the dawn.
