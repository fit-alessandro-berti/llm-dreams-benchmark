### **You Are at a Large Social Gathering Where You Only Know One Person...**

As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and…

---

**…you notice that each group you pass seems to exist in its own little bubble of reality.** One circle of people is laughing loudly over a table cluttered with vintage board games, their laughter echoing like music. Another group is silently seated on floor cushions, eyes closed, holding hands as if meditating together. A third cluster is animatedly debating art, their voices rising and falling in a rhythmic cadence, while a young man nearby sketches their expressions with uncanny speed.

You weave through the crowd, scanning faces, searching for the one familiar one—you know only their smile, the way they push their hair back when they’re nervous. But everyone you pass feels… *off*. Not hostile, just *unknown*, as if you’ve never truly met them before, even though their eyes meet yours with recognition.

Then you spot a group that makes you pause.

They are standing under a string of mismatched fairy lights, and they are *dancing*—not to any music you can hear, but moving in perfect, silent sync, their bodies swaying like trees in a breeze only they can feel. Their eyes are closed, and their faces are serene, almost serene *too* much. You feel a strange pull toward them, as if they know something you don’t.

As you approach, one of them opens their eyes and looks straight at you. They smile—not warm, not cold, but *curious*. They mouth three words, though no sound escapes their lips:

**“Are you lost?”**

You open your mouth to answer, but before you can speak, the scene shifts.

**Suddenly, you are in a hallway.**  
The music and chatter fade into a low hum behind you. The walls are lined with old photographs, each one slightly damaged—corners torn, eyes in the faces scratched out. You walk slowly, drawn forward by a faint glow at the end of the corridor.

And then you see *them*.

Your one person.  
They are sitting cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by a ring of candles that flicker despite there being no wind. They look up at you with eyes that seem too deep, like pools reflecting stars that shouldn’t exist in this place.

“Hi,” they say, their voice soft but clear. “I’ve been waiting for you.”

You kneel beside them, the warmth of the candles enveloping you like a secret. For the first time in this strange gathering, you feel *seen*.

But just as you begin to speak, the candles gutter out—one by one. The photographs on the walls begin to peel off, fluttering to the ground like butterflies with torn wings. The room grows darker, and the silence heavier.

Then, from the shadows beyond the ring of darkness, you hear a whisper—*your own voice*, saying:

**“You don’t really belong here.”**

**What do you do next?**  
Do you step into the darkness… or stay seated beside the person you came to find, even as the world around you begins to unravel?
