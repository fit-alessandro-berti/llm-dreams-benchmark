take a deep breath. As you exhale, you notice the surroundings slowly shifting, softening into blurred edges. The tense atmosphere gently dissolves into calmness. You find yourself standing with your friend in a serene forest clearing, filled with pale moonlight and quiet rustling leaves.

Your friend's anger gradually fades, and their eyes soften as they reach out to you. You reach back and touch their hand, feeling warmth and forgiveness flow freely between you. Together, you sit beneath a vast, peaceful sky, realizing the dispute wasn't as important as your bond.

In this gentle clarity, you exchange quiet words of understanding, relieved that closeness has triumphed over misunderstanding. You know the strength of your friendship persists beyond conflicts, and you both promise to communicate better, trusting each other fully. As the peaceful dream fades, the feeling of warmth, reconciliation, and mutual understanding stays with you, comforting you upon awakening.
