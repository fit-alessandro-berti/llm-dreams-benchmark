…travel towards the faint glow on the horizon, the last sign of electricity you’ve seen in weeks. Every step crunches on broken glass and gravel. Ahead, blackened skyscrapers loom like ancient tombstones, their windows hollow eyes in the pale dawn.

As you move, you come across an empty bus, rusty and overgrown with weeds. Inside, you find a half-empty canteen and a faded photograph of a family. You tuck both into your backpack, deciding they might bring luck—or at least comfort.

You press on, keeping to the shadows, always alert for movement. Once, the distant howl of a scavenger pack makes you pause, heart pounding. You crouch behind a shattered wall until the noise fades.

The glow ahead grows brighter, resolving into string lights wrapped around a barricade. Figures stand atop it, armed but not hostile. You hesitate, then raise your hands in peace. One of them waves. “Traveler! Safe passage if you barter!”

Despite exhaustion, hope stirs. You approach warily, negotiating away the last of your batteries for a bowl of hot stew and a cot for the night. 

For the first time in ages, you sleep under shelter, the sounds of other survivors breathing softly all around you. Even in this ruined world, you realize, community—and dreams—can still endure.
