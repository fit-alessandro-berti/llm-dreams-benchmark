…grip the wheel with both hands, feeling the wood shudder beneath your fingers as lightning fractures the sky. The wind screams like a thousand voices in your ears, tearing at the sails, pulling you toward the jagged silhouette of unseen rocks ahead.

Your crew’s eyes—wide, pale in the ghostly light—search your face for a plan. You shout a command, your voice almost stolen by the gale, and they move in unison, grappling ropes, reefing sails, trusting you more than the elements themselves.

The sea rises like a living thing, a black wall crowned with foam, and for a heartbeat you wonder if it has chosen you, specifically, to test. Then a flash of lightning freezes the world in a split-second tableau: the wave, towering; the deck, slick and tilting; the faces of your people illuminated like statues; and far in the distance, between the cracks of darkness, the faint glow of something… impossible.

It’s not a lighthouse—too high, too strange, shifting in colors you’ve never seen. It seems to pulse with intent, as if watching.

You feel a pull inside your chest, stronger than the sea’s drag, whispering to steer toward this light—though you know the current heads elsewhere, toward safer waters.

Your hands tighten on the wheel. The storm roars, waiting for your choice.  

Do you:  
**A)** Turn toward the strange, unearthly glow?  
**B)** Fight the storm to keep to the known, safer route?  

Which way should the dream go?
