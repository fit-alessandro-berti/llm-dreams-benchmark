grip the helm tightly, seawater spraying across your face as the ship lurches over a swollen wave. The sky is a bruise of purple and gray, lightning splitting it open like a jagged wound. Your crew—hardened sailors with salt-crusted beards—shout over the howling wind, their eyes wide with a mix of fear and trust. You’ve sailed through storms before, but this one feels different, alive with a fury that rattles the timbers beneath your boots.
“Steady the mainsail!” you bellow, voice cutting through the chaos. The crew scrambles, ropes slipping through calloused hands as the ship groans under the strain. You squint through the torrential rain, searching the horizon for a break in the tempest. There—a faint shimmer of calm waters, a promise of respite if you can just hold course.
The wheel fights you like a wild beast, but you lean into it, muscles burning, resolve hardening. A monstrous wave rears up, towering over the deck, and for a moment, time slows. You see the crew brace, see the splintered wood of the railing, feel the icy dread clawing at your chest. Then the wave crashes, a deafening roar, and the ship tilts perilously. You hold fast, barking orders—“Pump the bilge! Secure the lines!”—as the sea tries to claim you.
But you’re not done yet. The storm may rage, but you’ve got a crew to lead and a ship to save. With a deep breath, you steer toward that distant calm, the taste of salt and defiance on your tongue. The dream blurs here, the edges softening, but you know one thing: you’ll see this through, or go down with the ship trying.
