…written entirely in ancient Sumerian cuneiform, but that’s not the weird part.

The weird part is that every question is about *you*. Not the course material. You.

Question 1: “Describe, in detail, the exact moment in third grade when you lied about finishing your vegetables and hid them in your napkin. Include emotional motivation and long-term karmic consequences.”

Question 2: “Rank the following people you ghosted in 2023 from ‘most deserved it’ to ‘still thinks about you at 2 a.m.’ Provide citations.”

Question 3: “Translate your most crippling insecurity into a haiku. Then solve for x.”

The proctor (who looks suspiciously like your childhood dentist, except he has the eyes of your ex) leans over and whispers, “No pressure, but if you get less than 92%, you will wake up tomorrow as the version of yourself that never learned to parallel park. Forever.”

Your pencil is suddenly a live salmon. It’s flopping. It’s judging you.

You flip to the last page. There’s only one final instruction:

“Explain why you deserve to pass… using only the lyrics to the song that was playing the first time you ever slow-danced.”

The salmon winks.

What do you do?
