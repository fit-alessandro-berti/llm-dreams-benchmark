...find a way to communicate. The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth, and the low morning sun filters through thatched roofs. You’re standing in a muddy village lane, flanked by wattle-and-daub cottages. Chickens peck at the ground, and a woman in a coarse woolen dress pauses mid-step, eyeing you with suspicion.

Your modern clothes—jeans, a graphic tee, sneakers—mark you as an outsider. Worse, you don’t recognize the language she’s muttering under her breath. Panic prickles your skin. *No phone. No ID. No way home.*

You need to **blend in, survive, and understand**. First, the clothes. You spot a clothesline behind one cottage—rough-spun tunics and linen wraps flutter in the breeze. Stealing feels wrong, but shivering in damp jeans as night falls feels worse. You’ll barter: you’ve got nothing but your wits… and a stainless-steel watch on your wrist. To them, it’s a curious trinket—maybe worth a meal or a spare tunic.

Next, the language. You mimic gestures: point to your mouth, rub your stomach. The woman’s eyes narrow, then soften. She tosses you a hard loaf of bread. *“Grās,”* she says. Grass? Grain? You nod eagerly, “Grās! Thank you!” She barks a laugh and beckons you inside.

Over a firepit, her family watches you like a stray dog—wary but curious. You mimic their actions: chew slowly, sip the bitter herbal brew from a wooden cup. One child drops a carved wooden horse at your feet. You pick it up, trace the grain, and whisper, “Beautiful.” The word is the same in any age.

That night, wrapped in scratchy wool near the hearth, you realize: survival isn’t about technology. It’s about reading eyes, sharing silence, and the universal language of kindness.  

But as embers fade, a deeper need claws at you: *How did I get here? And will I ever wake up?*  

Outside, an owl calls—three sharp notes. In your dream-memory, that sound meant something… a signal? A warning? You drift toward sleep within the dream, chasing the echo.
