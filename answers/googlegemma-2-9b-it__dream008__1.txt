...feel a surge of panic.  My throat tightens, and I struggle to form words. The air around me seems to shimmer, the fluorescent lights buzzing like angry hornets. I stutter, "Sir, the deadline... it's... impossible!"

My boss, always impeccably dressed even in his sleepwalking state (he was wearing a size-too-small suit that strained across his taut, pale chest), sighs dramatically. "Nothing is impossible, (Your Name)," he drones, his voice echoing oddly in the cavernous, empty office. "Find a way."

He turns and glides away, leaving me staring at a mountain of folders spilling out on my desk. Each folder is labelled with cryptic symbols that seem to shift and writhe before my eyes. The deadline, written in glowing, crimson font, pulses like a malevolent heart: 00:00 - T+1. Zero hours, minus one day.

Suddenly, the room begins to spin. I stumble, clinging to my chair as the walls melt away, replaced by a swirling vortex of colours and shapes. I hear a chaotic symphony of distant, disembodied voices whispering, "No time... no time..."


Then, I open my eyes.

Sweat clinging to my brow, I realise I'm back in my bedroom, the glow of my alarm clock casting an eerie orange light on the wall. Five minutes till morning. The dream fades, leaving a lingering sense of unease. But something else rumbles inside me, a spark of defiance. 

I might not be able to conquer impossible deadlines in my dreams, but maybe... just maybe... I could learn to say no in real life.
