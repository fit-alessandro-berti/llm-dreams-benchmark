You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air grows heavy and electric around you. The trees begin to whisper in a language you almost understand, their leaves turning silver-white as the wind picks up.

The sky shifts from a warm amber dusk to something altogether stranger — a deep bruised violet, streaked with threads of green light that pulse like breathing. Thunder rolls in from somewhere impossibly far away, so low you feel it more in your chest than hear it with your ears.

You should be frightened. But you aren't.

Instead you feel **called**.

Your feet move forward without quite deciding to, and the forest opens into a clearing you are somehow certain has been waiting for you specifically. In the center stands an enormous oak tree, ancient beyond reckoning, its bark carved with symbols that seem to rearrange themselves when you look away.

The rain begins — but it falls *upward*. 

Droplets rise from the moss and the dark earth, lifting in slow spirals toward the churning sky, carrying with them the smell of deep roots and old stone and something sweeter underneath, like a memory you lost before you knew to keep it.

A figure stands at the base of the oak. 

Not threatening. Not quite human either. Built from the same materials as the forest itself — bark-skin, hair like Spanish moss, eyes that are simply two gaps of starlight.

It holds out one hand.

In its palm rests a single object — small enough to close a fist around. You step closer and see that it is...

**a compass with no cardinal directions**. 

Instead of North, South, East, West, its four points are marked with words that shift as the lightning flashes:

*Remember. Forget. Return. Begin.*

The needle spins and spins and then, with a sound like a held breath finally released —

It points directly at you.

The figure speaks. The voice arrives not through the air but through the soles of your feet, up through your bones:

*"You already know which one."*

And the extraordinary thing — the thing that will stay with you even after waking, glowing at the edges of ordinary Tuesday mornings for weeks afterward — is that you **do**.

You reach out your hand.

The storm holds perfectly still, waiting.

And you choose.
