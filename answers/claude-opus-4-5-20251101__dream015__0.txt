*The dream shimmers and takes shape around me...*

I decide to **plant a garden**.

It seems absurd at first. The sky is that perpetual amber-grey, and somewhere in the distance, twisted metal groans against the wind. But I've found this cracked concrete courtyard behind what used to be a library, and there's soil underneath—real soil, dark and waiting.

I'm on my knees, pushing seeds into the earth with dirty fingers. I don't know where the seeds came from. Dream logic. They're just *there*, warm in my palm like small promises.

A child watches me from a collapsed doorway. Then an old woman with a shopping cart. They don't speak, but eventually they kneel beside me. The woman produces a dented watering can from nowhere. The child starts clearing rubble with small, determined hands.

We work in silence as the amber light shifts.

I realize I'm not trying to survive. I'm trying to **remember**—or maybe *teach*—that things can grow. That the impulse to nurture doesn't die just because the world did.

When I look up, green shoots are already pushing through the cracks, impossibly fast, the way time moves in dreams. The child laughs—the first sound anyone has made—and it echoes off the ruins like water.

*The dream doesn't end. It just... expands.*
