completely blank. The pages are crisp, the ink smudges where your fingers touch, but there are no words. You flip through the entire booklet—nothing. 

A whisper echoes through the exam hall. You glance up, but the proctor, a tall figure with an indistinct face, only stares at you. The other students scribble furiously, their pens gliding over their pages as if the questions are clear to them. You try to ask the person next to you what’s happening, but when you open your mouth, no sound comes out.

Panic sets in. The clock on the wall moves faster than it should, hands spinning in jerky motions. You grip your pen and press it against the paper, hoping something will appear. 

Suddenly, ink seeps from the pen tip, spreading like dark tendrils across the page. Words begin to form—not in the exam’s neat typeface, but in your own handwriting. The letters rearrange, twist, shift. The questions are not about the course material. They are about **you**. 

"Who are you, really?"  
"What do you fear the most?"  
"What will happen if you fail?"  

The words pulse like they are alive. The whisper returns, growing into a chorus of voices—some familiar, some distant. The proctor steps closer. You look up and realize they now have your own face. 

The room fades, dissolving into a swirling void of pages and ink, and just as you're about to fall—  

You wake up.
