run through the streets, your heart pounding with urgency. As you turn a corner, you see a group of people gathered around a street performer who seems to be predicting the future. Intrigued and desperate for any help, you approach the crowd.

The performer, an old man with wise eyes and a kind smile, looks directly at you as if he can see right through to your anxious soul. He gestures for you to come closer. As you lean in, he whispers, "Do not fear the unknown paths; they often lead to where you need to be."

Feeling a strange mix of reassurance and confusion, you thank him and continue running. Suddenly, you notice that the city's architecture is changing subtly around you—buildings shift and blend into one another in ways that defy logic. You realize this must be a manifestation of your subconscious mind, reflecting your anxiety and uncertainty.

You come across a small, quaint café that you somehow recognize from a dream or perhaps a memory. Inside, you see a familiar face—someone who has always been supportive and encouraging. They hand you a map with a route marked out in red ink leading straight to your destination. It’s as if they knew exactly where you needed to go.

With renewed confidence, you follow the path on the map. The route takes you through hidden alleys and over bridges that weren’t there moments ago. Each step feels more natural, and the city begins to feel less alien.

As you arrive at your meeting location, you find that you are not late after all. The room is empty except for a single person waiting for you—a colleague or friend, someone who understands the importance of this meeting. They smile warmly and say, "I’m glad you made it. We have a lot to discuss."

In this dream, you realize that the journey itself was the true destination, and that sometimes, the most important meetings happen within ourselves.
