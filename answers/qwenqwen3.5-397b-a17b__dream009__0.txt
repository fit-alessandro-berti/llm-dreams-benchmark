...you realize you need to find a clock that ticks backwards to fix something you haven't broken yet.

The air smells of woodsmoke and wet iron. You are wearing clothes that feel unfamiliar against your skin—heavy wool, rough linen, laced tight at the throat. The street you stand on is cobblestoned, glowing under the light of a moon that is far too large and fractured into three distinct crescents.

People pass you, their faces blurred as if seen through frosted glass. They do not speak, but their intentions ripple through the air like heat haze. You feel an urgent weight in your pocket. Reaching in, you pull out a brass key that is warm to the touch, pulsing slightly like a heartbeat.

You know, with the absolute certainty of dream logic, that this key opens the clock tower looming at the end of the alley. You run, but your feet feel heavy, as if you are running underwater. The tower grows no closer, yet the ticking sound grows louder. It isn't a mechanical tick, but the sound of water dripping into a deep well. *Drip. Drip. Drip.*

When you finally reach the base of the tower, there is no door, only a curtain of hanging vines that shimmer like silver thread. You push through them. Inside, there are no stairs, only a spiral of floating stones. You step onto the first one, and it holds. You climb.

At the top, there is no clock face, only a mirror framed in gears. You look into it, but your reflection is not you; it is an older version of yourself, holding a lantern. The reflection mouths the words, *"Not yet."*

The brass key in your hand turns to dust. The tower begins to dissolve into mist. The sound of the dripping water becomes the sound of your alarm clock, rhythmic and insistent. The three crescent moons merge into one bright sun pressing against your eyelids.

You wake up, the taste of iron still on your tongue, and for a fleeting second, you could have sworn your heart was ticking backwards.
