You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to settle it once and for all by challenging them to a duel... but not with swords or fists. No, in this dream logic, it's a duel of giant inflatable sumo suits on the edge of a volcano.

Your friend laughs maniacally, slipping into a neon-pink sumo bubble that inflates like a balloon animal gone wrong. You squeeze into your own—a glowing blue monstrosity that smells faintly of cotton candy and regret. The ground beneath you morphs into a bubbling lava trampoline, hot air whooshing up in bursts that send you both bouncing wildly.

"Last one standing wins!" you shout, charging forward. But as you collide, the suits pop like overripe watermelons, spraying confetti and feathers everywhere. Suddenly, you're both plummeting into the volcano, but instead of burning, you land in a pool of warm chocolate pudding. Your friend surfaces, covered head to toe, and bursts out laughing.

"Truce?" they gasp, offering a pudding-smeared hand.

You grin, shaking it. "Truce." The volcano erupts into fireworks, spelling out "Best Friends Forever" in the sky. Then, the dream fades, and you wake up with a chocolate stain on your pillow, wondering if it was real.
