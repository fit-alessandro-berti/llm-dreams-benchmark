you quicken your pace, glancing up at the darkening sky. The trees around you seem to shift slightly, their branches creaking and swaying as if they're alive. Lightning flickers in the distance, casting eerie shadows on the forest floor. You hear the faint sound of thunder rumbling, growing louder with each passing moment.

Before you can fully comprehend what's happening, the first raindrops begin to fall—small, cool droplets that quickly turn into a torrential downpour. The ground beneath your feet turns soggy, and you find yourself slipping and sliding as you try to find shelter. 

Suddenly, you notice a small, glowing clearing just ahead. It seems untouched by the storm, its light illuminating a path through the thick canopy of trees. Without hesitation, you run toward it, the wind howling around you, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.

As you reach the clearing, you see a figure standing there—a silhouette barely visible through the mist. The figure holds out a hand, and for a moment, you hesitate, unsure whether to trust this unknown presence. But something about the glow around them feels warm and inviting.

You take a step forward, and as you do, the storm begins to recede. The wind quiets, the rain slows to a gentle drizzle, and the sky above starts to clear, revealing a patch of blue between the clouds. The figure steps closer, and you realize it's not a stranger at all—it's someone familiar, someone you've been searching for in your waking life.

You exchange a knowing glance, and in that moment, you both understand that this dream is more than just a random sequence of events. It's a sign, a message, or perhaps even a memory from your past.
