written in a language you've never seen before. The letters shift and glow on the paper, rearranging themselves just as you think you might recognize a word. 

Panic rises in your chest. You glance around, but none of your classmates seem alarmed—they're all furiously writing, as if the strange script makes perfect sense to them. You flip the pages, hoping for a question you can understand, when suddenly, the professor appears at your side. 

"You already know the answers," they say in a voice that echoes strangely. "You just have to remember." 

Their words trigger a sensation deep in your mind, like something forgotten stirring awake. The letters on the paper shift again, but this time, they begin to make sense. Memories you've never had flood your thoughts—flashes of places you've never been, symbols etched into walls, whispered incantations. 

You pick up your pen. 

The exam has begun.
