You decide to pause the argument and seek a middle ground. You tell your friend you want to hear them out first, then speak without heat. As you speak, a doorway hums into existence at the edge of the room. You both step through and find yourselves in a quiet, moonlit library where memories and values float like lanterns. You take turns describing what you each fear and what you truly need from the outcome. The tension loosens as you realize the dispute is less about the issue and more about feeling heard and respected by someone you care about. After listening, you agree on a small, concrete step you can take today and a reminder to revisit the conversation with kindness if it arises again. Hand in hand, you walk back through the doorway, and the argument settles into a calm, honest talk, the dream ending with a shared sense of clarity and connection.
