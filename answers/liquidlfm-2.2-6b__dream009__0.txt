...find water. The air feels crisp and different, filled with the scent of pine and damp earth. No smartphones, no screens, just the hum of a bustling town that moves at a slower, more deliberate pace. You spot a river winding through the landscape, its surface shimmering. I stumble toward it, my heart pounding.

I remember the way people used to gather around hearths, share stories, and rely on one another. Here, a wooden bridge crosses the river, supported by weathered timbers. I scan the bank, hoping to see some signs of habitation. A plume of smoke rises ahead—brown, steady, coming from a cottage. Mist hangs in the air, clinging to the stone walls of the building.

I push open the door, and a warm glow spills out. Smoke curls from a small stove inside, carrying the smell of wood and something sweet—a baked bread, perhaps? My hands tremble as I search through the clutter of driftwood furniture and handwritten recipes. I pull out a chipped ceramic bowl and a small, wooden spoon. The table is set with a breakfast typical of this past era: thick crust bread, butter, cheese, and fresh fruit from a nearby orchard.

A woman in an apron with flour smudged on her cheeks winks at me. “Come in, traveler,” she says, her voice soft and familiar. “We’ve been expecting you.”

And here I am, suddenly anchored in a world without time zones, no money or screens, just story, season, and the quiet rhythm of a life older than modernity. For now, I fall into a basket chair by the hearth, listening to her speak in whispers about a friend far away—their lives and seasons mingling in a strange, warm, simple bond across centuries.
