As you move deeper into the maze, the air grows cooler, and the walls seem to close in slightly, heightening your sense of focus and urgency. The puzzles become increasingly intricate, challenging your mind in new and unexpected ways.

1. **The Crystal Cube Puzzle**:
   You come across a large crystal cube suspended in mid-air. On each of its six faces, there is a series of glowing runes. You need to rotate the cube to align the correct runes on opposite faces. The correct sequence is hidden in a riddle carved into the pedestal below the cube:
   *"I am taken from a mine, and shut up in a wooden case, from which I am never released, and yet I am used by almost every person. What am I?"*
   You ponder the riddle and realize the answer is a pencil lead. With this insight, you rotate the cube to align the runes.

2. **The Mirror Labyrinth**:
   Next, you enter a room filled with mirrors, creating an infinite reflection of yourself. The goal is to navigate through the labyrinth without touching the mirrors. You notice a pattern in the reflections that hints at the correct path. You walk carefully, using the reflections as a guide, and successfully make your way through.

3. **The Whispering Shadows**:
   In a dimly lit chamber, shadows on the walls whisper clues to a hidden door. Each shadow reveals a piece of a phrase when illuminated by a specific color of light. You find a lens that can split the light into different colors and use it to decode the shadows. The phrase "The key is in the light" is revealed, leading you to a small, glowing key hidden in a niche on the wall.

4. **The Gravity Shift Room**:
   The final challenge is a room where gravity shifts in unpredictable patterns. You must navigate through a series of platforms that only appear when you stand on the correct spot. Using your logical thinking, you solve the pattern of the shifting gravity and leap safely from platform to platform, reaching a lever that opens the exit to the maze.

As you step through the exit, the maze transforms into a lush, green forest. You feel a sense of accomplishment and relief, knowing you've conquered the maze and its puzzles. The sun is setting, casting a warm glow over the forest, and you take a moment to savor the tranquility before waking up.
