…you start to walk briskly through the dense, labyrinthine streets, the buildings towering above you in surreal mismatched architecture—gothic cathedrals leaning against glass skyscrapers, treehouses sprouting from clock towers. The sky above shifts in color like an oil spill—blue then gold then deep indigo—as time seems to slip between your fingers.

You reach into your pocket for your phone, but instead you pull out a folded, old-fashioned map. The paper is warm to the touch, and the streets on it seem to rearrange themselves the longer you stare. Somewhere toward the center, in looping calligraphy, is your destination: **The Hall of Recognition**.
