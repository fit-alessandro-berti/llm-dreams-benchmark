a kaleidoscope of unfamiliar faces. A wave of polite laughter washes over you from a circle discussing something you can't hear. You nod and smile, your eyes scanning the room, looking for the one anchor you have in this sea of strangers.

You spot a familiar silhouette near a grand fireplace and feel a surge of relief. But as you get closer, the person turns, and it's not your friend at all, just a stranger with a similar haircut. Your hope deflates.

Pushing through a bit of awkward small talk about the art on the walls with a couple you've never met, you finally catch a glimpse of them. They are across the room, their back to you, talking animatedly with a small group. You start making your way over, navigating through the hum of conversations and the clinking of glasses.

Just as you are about to reach out and tap their shoulder, you notice their posture is stiff, their laughter a little forced. You see them subtly glance towards the exit, a flicker of the same social fatigue you're feeling flashing in their eyes.

In that moment, you don't say their name. You don't interrupt. Instead, you understand. You both are islands here, and your shared secret is the desire to escape.

You catch their eye from across the group and give a small, almost imperceptible nod towards the door. Their face lights up with genuine relief. A few minutes later, you meet by the coats, share a conspiratorial smile, and step out into the cool, quiet night, the muffled sounds of the party fading behind you. You found them, and in doing so, you found your way out.
