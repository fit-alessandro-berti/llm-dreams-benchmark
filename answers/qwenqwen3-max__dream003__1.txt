...symbols etched into its surface—swirling vines that seem to shift when you tilt the box, constellations that reconfigure themselves like living star charts, and a faint hum resonating from within, as if something were breathing.  

Your fingers trace the grooves absentmindedly, and suddenly, the patterns warm beneath your touch. A single phrase glows softly along the lid in a language you’ve never seen—but somehow understand: *"Only the dreamer may open what the dreamer has forgotten."*  

Confused, you close your eyes, searching your memory. Fragments surface: childhood laughter, a lullaby your grandmother used to hum, the smell of rain on hot pavement… and then—a key. Not a metal one, but a melody. The lullaby.  

You hum it, softly at first, then with more certainty. The box pulses in time with the notes. With a final, resonant chord, the lid clicks open—not with a snap, but a sigh, as if relieved to be remembered.  

Inside lies not treasure, but a smaller version of the same box… and a note that reads: *"You were never looking for what’s inside. You were looking for why you locked it away."*  

Just then, the dream begins to fray at the edges—light bleeds in from beyond the darkness, and the ground beneath you softens like sand slipping through your fingers. You wake with the echo of the lullaby still in your ears… and the unsettling sense that somewhere, another you is still dreaming, holding a box just like this one.
