you hear the distant rumble of thunder rolling through the hills. The leaves around you begin to shiver as a sudden wind snakes through the trees, carrying with it the scent of rain and something… unfamiliar, like cold iron.

The sky darkens unnaturally fast, the rich greens of the forest fading into shadow. You look up through the swaying branches and see clouds boiling together, spiraling toward a single point directly overhead. The air grows heavy, pressing on your chest as if the forest itself is holding its breath.

In the hush before the first drop of rain, a flicker of light dances between the trunks—a faint, ghostly shimmer that seems to beckon you deeper into the woods. The wind carries a whisper, too soft to fully understand, but it sounds almost like your name.

A brilliant flash of lightning strikes somewhere close, yet there’s no thunder. The forest path seems to split in two directions: one leading toward the light, the other toward the sound of rushing water that wasn’t there a moment ago.

You realize you can only choose one…  

Would you like me to **continue the dream by exploring the path toward the light**, or toward **the sound of the water**?
