As you begin the final exam, the room transforms into a sanctuary of purpose and ambition. The questions spiral like a thousand threads weaving through your mind—each one a challenge, a thought, a step toward unlocking the future you’ve been working toward. The exam’s question is a mirror reflecting your journey: “How do you envision your career path in three years?” followed by a prompt like, “What roles will you be managing as a result of your unique abilities?” Each answer is a testament to growth, resilience, and the courage to explore beyond convention. The dream fades into a stillness of thought and purpose, leaving you with the clarity that this is not just an end but the beginning of something even greater.
