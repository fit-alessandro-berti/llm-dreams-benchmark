...you weave through the lively crowd, the din of laughter and chatter a distant hum beneath the pounding of your own heart. You recognize the back of their head—the familiar slope of their shoulders—across the room, but as you move closer, the crowd shifts like a tide, and they are swallowed by the sea of strangers.

A group of art enthusiasts passionately debates the use of chiaroscuro in a painting you haven't seen. One of them, a woman with kind eyes and a silk scarf, turns and includes you with a smile. "Don't you agree the light seems to originate from within the subject itself?" she asks. You mumble something about the emotional weight of light, and they nod earnestly before you excuse yourself, your eyes scanning frantically.

Next, you pass a circle of people engrossed in a story. "…and then the ferret, I swear, was riding the Roomba like a chariot!" howls a man, and the group erupts. Their joy is infectious, and for a split second, you forget your search and smile. But the moment passes. You are a ship set on a single course.

You finally spot your friend near a grand piano, their hand resting on its polished lid. A wave of relief washes over you. You push past the last few people, your hand beginning to rise in a wave.

And as you reach them, they turn. But the face that looks back at you is not the one you were searching for. It's a stranger, wearing your friend's jacket, their expression one of polite confusion. You stammer an apology, your certainty crumbling.

You turn, completely disoriented now, the crowd seeming to press in closer. And then, you feel a gentle tap on your shoulder.

You spin around.

And it's them. The real them. Their familiar face breaks into a wide, warm smile.

"There you are," they say, their voice cutting cleanly through the noise. "I've been looking everywhere for you. Come on, the best part is about to start."

They take your hand, and the crowd seems to part effortlessly before you both.
