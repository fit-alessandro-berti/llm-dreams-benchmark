You realize the walls are no longer made of stone or hedge, but of shifting geometric light. The silence of the maze deepens, and the puzzles begin to mutate. Where once there were logic gates and mathematical sequences, now there are doors that only open when you stop thinking, and corridors that lengthen or shorten based on your heartbeat. 

You reach the center, expecting a final exam of wit, but instead you find a simple mirror. The reflection isn't your waking self, but someone you used to be, holding the answer you’ve been looking for. As you reach out to touch the glass, the maze dissolves into the sky, and you wake up with the lingering sensation that you solved the riddle not by thinking harder, but by finally letting go.
