You are dreaming. You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and… they *shift*. Not physically, but like looking at an optical illusion. The swirling designs, initially resembling vines and leaves, subtly morph into constellations, then into faces – fleeting, almost recognizable faces of people I haven’t seen in years. My grandmother, a childhood friend, even… myself, but younger.

The box is cool to the touch, made of a dark, polished wood I can’t identify. It feels ancient, yet strangely…alive. There are no hinges visible, no obvious seams. Just smooth, unbroken surfaces covered in these mesmerizing, changing patterns. 

I run my fingers over the surface, tracing the constellations as they bloom and fade. As I do, a faint humming begins, resonating not in my ears, but *within* my chest. The humming grows stronger, and the patterns accelerate, becoming a dizzying kaleidoscope. 

Suddenly, a single symbol glows brightly amidst the chaos – a stylized eye, weeping a single, silver tear. As I focus on it, a voice, not spoken but *felt*, whispers in my mind, “Remember what you’ve forgotten.”

Forgotten? What have I forgotten? I rack my brain, trying to grasp at a lost memory, a hidden truth. The box vibrates now, almost violently. The eye symbol pulses, and the humming reaches a fever pitch. 

Then, a small indentation appears on the side of the box, perfectly shaped for… a fingertip. Hesitantly, I press my index finger into the indentation. 

The box doesn’t click, it *sings*. A clear, bell-like tone rings out, and the patterns on the box solidify, resolving into a single, breathtaking image: a field of lavender under a twilight sky.  And in the center of the field, a small, wooden swing set, just like the one my grandfather built for me. 

A wave of intense nostalgia washes over me, so powerful it almost knocks me to my knees. I *remember*. Not a specific event, but a feeling. A feeling of pure, unadulterated joy, of being utterly safe and loved. 

The box slowly begins to open, not with a creak, but with a sigh. Inside, nestled on a bed of velvet, isn’t gold or jewels, but a single, dried lavender sprig.  As I reach for it, the dream begins to dissolve, the lavender scent growing fainter and fainter… and I feel a single, warm tear roll down my cheek, mirroring the silver tear on the box.



Then, darkness. And the unsettling feeling that I’m still forgetting something important.
