…leave the cracked highway behind and climb the skeletal remains of a radio tower to get a better view. Wind whistles through the rust‑eaten lattice, sounding almost like voices humming an ancient lullaby. From the top you see three things:

1. A faint ribbon of green sprouting across the shattered concrete riverbed—living plants.
2. A lone signal light blinking in a long‑abandoned metro station—possible shelter.
3. A moving shape that glitters like broken mirrors—something (or someone) unknown.

You decide hope is worth the risk and head toward the riverbed first. The ground is baked to porcelain, but beneath a slab you uncover a trickle of water. Kneeling, you cup it in your palms and taste spring instead of rust. Beside the stream grows a single sunflower, its face turned not to the gray sky but to you, as if measuring your resolve. You pluck a handful of its seeds, whisper an apology, and pocket them—future life insurance.

Night falls fast. Fluorescent clouds roll overhead, flashing purple like bruises. You hurry to the metro entrance. Inside, phosphorescent fungus paints the walls aquamarine. Broken posters flap like moth wings. In the central concourse you discover the blinking light: an antique radio, jury‑rigged to a car battery that somehow still holds a charge. You spin the dial. Static. Then a voice—calm, steady, impossibly clear:

“If you can hear this, follow the glass wolves.”

Glass wolves? Your breath fogs in the cold tunnel air, and footprints begin to materialize ahead—each pawprint a small shard of mirrored ice reflecting your puzzled face. You follow.

Deep in the service corridor the walls melt into frost‑covered trees, and you realize the metro has become a forest without transition, as dreams often do. The glass wolves pad silently between the trunks, refracting moonlight into rainbows. They lead you to an amphitheater of frozen water, a lake flash‑frozen mid‑wave. At its center rests a greenhouse made of scavenged windowpanes, glowing amber from within.

Inside, refugees from a dozen ruined towns tend rows of tomatoes, herbs, and baby fruit trees fed by a network of reclaimed pipes. A small girl approaches, holding out a clay pot. In it is a sprouting sunflower. You reach into your pocket and hand her your seeds. She smiles, places them in the soil, and says, “We were waiting for a gardener.”

As you kneel to help her pat the earth, the aurora outside flicks brighter, flooding the panes with electric green. The glass wolves sit at the threshold like sentinels. The radio crackles once more, but this time the voice is your own, echoing softly:

“Grow, even here.”

The dream ripples, the greenhouse panes dissolve into sunrise, and you wake with the taste of sunflower seeds on your tongue and the faint scent of tomato vines clinging to your clothes.
