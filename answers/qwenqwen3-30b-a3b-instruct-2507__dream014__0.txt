...you stumble forward, disoriented, the city's roar a wall of sound—honking horns, shouted conversations, the rhythmic clatter of a distant train. Then, a hand gently touches your shoulder. You turn.

A woman with kind eyes and a worn scarf smiles. "You look like you need a cup of tea," she says, her voice calm against the chaos. "Come with us."

Before you can protest, two others step forward—a man in a painter’s smock, a young girl clutching a sketchbook. They don’t ask your name, just gesture toward a narrow alley you hadn’t noticed, hidden by a curtain of ivy and paper lanterns glowing amber.

The alley opens into a hidden courtyard, small and serene. A tiny tea stall hums with quiet life. Steam curls from a kettle, and the scent of jasmine and ginger fills the air. There are no other people—no noise, no sirens, just the soft chime of wind-bells.

The woman pours tea into a chipped blue cup. "We’ve waited for you," she says, not unkindly. "You’ve been walking through city after city, trying to find someone who sees you. But you never needed to go far. You just needed someone to notice."

As you sip the tea, warm and sweet, the city’s sounds fade—not gone, but softened, like a memory. In the sketchbook, the girl draws your silhouette, not as lost, but as someone standing at the edge of something new.

And suddenly, you realize: **you’ve been here before. Not in this place—but in this feeling.** The warmth in your hands, the quiet breath in your chest, the sense of being seen *exactly as you are*—that was always the home you were searching for. The strangers aren’t guides. They’re echoes of your own courage, remembered.

You smile. And for the first time in a long time, you feel found.
