…fall into step beside them, letting the current of their easy confidence carry you through the chaos.

They guide you down an alley painted with neon murals that ripple like water when you pass. One stranger, a woman with silver‑tipped braids, asks your name; when you answer, the syllables drift upward and fuse with the city’s hum, as though the streets themselves have been waiting to hear it.

You reach a market square where vendor stalls float a handspan above the ground, tethered by strings of paper lanterns. The strangers buy steaming cups of jasmine‑ginger tea and pass one to you. The first sip evaporates the tight knot in your chest. Its warmth spreads outward, turning car horns into faint wind‑chimes and traffic lights into slow‑beating hearts.

As you walk, the strangers begin to share tiny, shimmering stories—fragments of dreams they once had about courage, patience, and laughter. Each tale settles on your shoulders like a feathered cloak, and you realize you are no longer cold or invisible.

Soon you arrive at an overlook where the whole city sprawls beneath a violet twilight. Roads twist into constellations; skyscrapers rise like crystal mountains. One stranger, a lanky youth with constellation tattoos, points to the skyline. “See that path of lights? It spells the way back to yourself.”

You follow his gesture and watch the pattern shift until it becomes an outline of your own silhouette. The strangers form a circle around you, linking hands. Their faces glow with the same color as the horizon. In unison, they whisper, “Ready?”

You nod.

The circle tightens gently, and the city lights flare, folding inward like origami stars. Suddenly you are standing alone on a quiet street that you recognize—your street—but everything feels lighter, as if someone opened a window inside your ribcage.

You exhale—and wake in your bed, morning sun filtering through the curtains. Though the bustle of real life soon returns, you carry the taste of jasmine‑ginger tea on your tongue and the certainty that, even when you feel lost again, there will always be kind strangers—outer or inner—ready to point you back home.
