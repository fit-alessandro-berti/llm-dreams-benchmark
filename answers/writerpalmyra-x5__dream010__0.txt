...each challenge starts to blur the line between skill and surrealism. One moment you're pitching a flawless campaign to stone-faced judges who scribble notes in a language that shifts between Latin and binary, and the next, you're racing across a library suspended in the sky, solving riddles whispered by floating books that dissolve into moths when answered.

The final round drops you into a room with no doors—just mirrors. Each reflection shows a different version of you: one dressed in the exact outfit you imagined for your dream job, another frozen mid-laugh at a job you rejected years ago, one silently crying, and another calmly walking away. A voice says, “Choose the one who deserves to win.”

But instead of picking, you ask, *“What if they all do?”*

The mirrors ripple. One by one, the reflections nod, then step out—not as copies, but as collaborators. Together, you rebuild the room into a studio, an office, a stage—your ideal workspace, shaped by every version of you that ever tried.

The trophy, when it appears, isn’t a solid object. It’s a quiet certainty: *this is already yours.*

Do you remember what the dream job was… or does it change depending on who’s asking?
