...panic. Your throat tightens. The index cards you’d clutched in your hand—your carefully rehearsed notes—are gone. Vanished. You pat your pockets frantically, but they’re empty. The spotlight burns, and a thousand faces blur into a single, expectant sea of eyes.

Then you notice something odd. The audience isn’t just waiting—they’re *leaning in*, almost as if they already know what you’re about to say. In fact, the person in the front row—a woman with silver-streaked hair and kind eyes—smiles faintly and whispers, “It’s alright. Just tell them about the birds.”

*Birds?* You don’t remember preparing anything about birds. But as you open your mouth to stammer an apology, your voice surprises you. It’s calm. Steady. Familiar, even though you’ve never heard it quite like this before.

“You know,” you begin, “birds don’t rehearse their songs. They just… sing.”

A ripple of quiet laughter runs through the crowd, warm and encouraging. You take a breath and glance out the tall windows behind the stage. Outside, the sky is streaked with twilight hues, and hundreds—no, thousands—of starlings swirl in a murmuration, their wings beating in perfect, chaotic harmony. For a moment, you forget the speech entirely. You just watch them, mesmerized.

And then you realize—you *are* the speech. Your life, your stumbles, your quiet joys, your unspoken fears—they are all part of this moment. The audience isn’t waiting for perfect words. They’re waiting for *you*.

So you speak. Not from notes, but from somewhere deeper. And as you do, the birds outside fall silent, as if listening too.

The dream ends not with applause, but with a shared breath—yours and theirs—hanging in the air like a promise.
