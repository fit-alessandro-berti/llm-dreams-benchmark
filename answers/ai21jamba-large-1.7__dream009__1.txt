…find a way to adapt to this unfamiliar world. The air feels different, crisp and untouched by the hum of machinery. The buildings, if you can call them that, are made of stone and wood, their rough-hewn surfaces telling tales of a simpler, yet harsher, time.

People bustle around you, dressed in garments that seem handcrafted, their speech carrying the lilt of a language you barely recognize. You catch snippets of conversation, gestures, and expressions, piecing together that you’ve arrived in a bustling marketplace of some sort. Vendors call out, their wares displayed on makeshift stalls—freshly baked bread, strange fruits, woven fabrics dyed in vibrant hues.

Your pockets are empty, and you quickly realize that money, at least as you knew it, holds no value here. Barter is the currency of the day. A thought strikes you—what skills or knowledge from your own time could you trade to survive?

As you mull over this, a stranger approaches. Their eyes, warm yet curious, seem to pierce through your uncertainty. “You are not from around here,” they say, their voice soft but firm. “Where do you come from?”

How will you answer? And more importantly, what will you do to navigate this world where every moment feels like walking a tightrope between wonder and danger?
