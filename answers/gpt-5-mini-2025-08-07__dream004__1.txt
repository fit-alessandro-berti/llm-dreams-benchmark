…it hums. The rectangle is not empty so much as patient, a hush of possibility framed in thin wood. When you lean closer you see that the blankness holds a faint pulse, like the memory of color just before dawn. Your breath fogs the surface and, for a single heartbeat, a smear of blue spreads where your exhale touched. It shivers and becomes a ribbon of sound — a low, whale-like note — then loosens into a river that runs off the canvas and pours into the ground at your feet, altering the landscape where it lands.

You reach out. The first fingertip leaves a mark that is not paint but a new law: a circling teal, and everywhere that teal touches the world, the trees rearrange into lattices of glass, leaves like stained panes. You think of a childhood laugh and the canvas sprouts tiny suns that orbit you, each one playing a different memory. You think of grief and a soft gray blooms, gentle and honest; it does not erase color but teaches the bright to be quieter, more patient. The shapes respond to intention: triangles bend toward answers, spheres cradle questions, and when you drag your hand stubbornly through a streak of crimson the streak peels off as a paper bird that flutters away writing sentences in the air with its wingbeat.

As you paint, the horizon rewrites itself. Mountains fold like origami; roads become rivers and rivers become constellations. People who pass become brushstrokes — a wandering musician leaves a blue smear that hums a tune long after they vanish; an old woman smiles and a lattice of silver threads sprouts from the canvas, connecting scattered fragments of the world into a slowly coherent tapestry. You realize the canvas is less an object than a listening thing: it takes what you give, but in its answering it gives you back a world that sometimes surprises you more than your own intentions did.

You have choices. You could fill the canvas with orderly maps and tidy cities and wake to a predictable day, or you could let it remain a mirror and paint only the questions, watching the world learn to be curious. You dip your fingers again and, without deciding, trace a small, imperfect circle at the center. The circle glows, expands, and becomes a doorway. From its depths there is no single scene but a shifting procession of possible lives — a child learning to swim, a stranger offering you a spare coat, a midnight train, a garden that grows every language as a different plant. They are all true for a moment.

You press your hand to the warm surface of that doorway. The canvas gives, like skin parting to welcome you in, and the landscape leans toward the choice you make. You could step through and live inside the painting's unfolding; you could step back and let the world hold what you've made; or you could close your eyes here, where colors are possibility, and catalog the shapes until they teach you how to paint the waking day. For a long time you simply listen to the hum, and the dream waits with you, generous and wide, until you make the smallest, bravest stroke.
