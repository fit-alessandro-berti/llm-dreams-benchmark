stand firm at the helm, the salty spray whipping across your face like a thousand icy needles. Lightning cracks the sky, illuminating the crew's wide-eyed faces—fear mingled with unyielding trust. "Steady now, lads!" you bellow over the howling wind. "Reef the mainsail! Batten down the hatches! We've danced with worse than this devil's brew!"

The ship groans under massive waves, plunging into abyssal troughs before clawing back up. In the chaos, your first mate shouts, pointing starboard: a colossal shadow looms through the froth—a leviathan's fin, or perhaps a rift in the sea itself, swirling with unearthly green light. Your heart pounds; this is no ordinary storm. With a surge of dream-fueled resolve, you spin the wheel hard to port. "Full sails on the jib! We're riding this beast straight through to dawn!"

The crew springs into action, ropes flying, voices rising in a defiant chorus. The ship surges forward, cresting a monstrous wave that hurls you toward the glowing rift. Time warps—colors bleed, the sea whispers secrets—and suddenly, you're through. The storm shatters like glass, revealing a tranquil lagoon under twin moons, islands of floating crystal drifting lazily. Your crew cheers, but as you turn, the wheel dissolves into mist. The dream fades, the ship's bell tolling softly... wake up, Captain. The real voyage awaits.
