...you weave through the crowd, each cluster of strangers revealing a different facet of this mysterious event. The room, bathed in a soft amber glow, seems to stretch infinitely in all directions; there’s no clear sense of walls or exits, just a steady hum of conversation punctuated by laughter or a clink of glass.

Your first encounter is with a group of three people standing near a sprawling dessert table. They wear elegant evening attire, but their accessories are odd: one man sports a pair of antique opera glasses around his neck, a woman cradles a porcelain teapot in the crook of her arm, and another man’s jacket is embroidered with detailed, moving images of koi fish. As you approach, they talk quietly among themselves about something called “the cloud garden.” When you ask if they’ve seen your friend, they tilt their heads in unison, as though choreographed, and shrug. The teapot woman smiles serenely. “No, but perhaps you will find them among the musicians,” she says. Her voice sounds distant, like it’s traveling through a dream of its own.

You move on, gently pushing past a small knot of people discussing the shapes of shadows thrown by antique lanterns. At a corner—though it’s not truly a corner since the space refuses to define itself so neatly—you come upon a trio of musicians tuning an array of bizarre instruments. One plays a sort of elongated mandolin made of silver glass, another has a cluster of wooden flutes strapped to their back, and the third holds a violin that hums softly even when the bow is still. They look at you expectantly, as if waiting for a request. You explain you’re searching for a familiar face. The violinist gives a tiny nod. “We played for them earlier. They were drawn to the dancers.” Their fingers move along the neck of the violin, as if drawing invisible maps in the air. “Go where the floor seems to ripple,” they add.

You leave them, following the subtle hint. You begin to notice that the wooden floorboards are not entirely steady beneath your feet. With every step, there’s a gentle undulation, as if the crowd stands atop a giant raft floating in calm waters. You follow this sensation until you see a patch of people wearing shimmering outfits that catch and refract the amber light. They are dancing, but not to any music you recognize. The motions are fluid and slow, each dancer moving in time with some silent current. You try to speak with them, but they only smile and spin away, their clothing sending little prisms of light into your eyes.

As you circle the dancers, you notice a quiet figure leaning against a column—or what passes for a column, a swirling pillar of fog that somehow holds up an arch overhead. This figure wears simple clothing, stands still amidst all the motion, and their face is partially obscured by the shifting haze. Something about their stance strikes a familiar chord. You approach, carefully. They do not turn around immediately, but you sense they know you’re there.

“Do you remember me?” you ask softly. The figure nods, and as they half-turn, you recognize your friend’s features, blurred a bit at the edges like someone seen through frosted glass. They look both relieved and slightly confused, as if they’ve also been navigating strange social currents in search of you. You reach out, and your hand passes through a swirl of mist before gently resting on their shoulder. The heat of contact is reassuringly real.

They blink slowly. “I was looking for you,” your friend says, their voice breathy and distant. Behind them, the crowd continues to shift and hum like a living tapestry. “People told me you were with the storytellers, or near the invisible fountain,” they continue. “I wandered for hours, or maybe minutes—time is so odd here.”

You step closer, standing side-by-side, trying to make sense of the dreamlike gathering. “I think we’re meant to find something here,” you say, uncertain whether you mean a clue, an answer, or simply each other. Your friend’s hand slips into yours and you feel a subtle pulse, a kind of gentle heartbeat under the surface of everything. Somewhere behind you, the musicians begin to play a soft, meandering tune that seems to draw the dessert-table trio closer, their teapot and opera glasses glinting. The dancers slow, their shimmering garments dimming as if the show is coming to an end.

In the quiet that follows, you and your friend look at each other, no longer lost, and know that whatever reason you had for attending this gathering—this strange and endless hall of luminous whispers and drifting figures—has led you back to each other. The dream’s logic is complete: the journey was the key, and the reunion is the door it opens.

As your surroundings fade, the murmurs and the glowing light fall away, leaving you with the faint memory of that warm touch and the lingering knowledge that you were never truly alone in the crowd.
