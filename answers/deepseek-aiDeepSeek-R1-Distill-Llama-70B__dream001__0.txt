run, your feet pounding against the cold, unfamiliar pavement. The city around you is a maze of towering skyscrapers and narrow alleyways, their reflections glinting in the windows like a fractured mirror. You clutch a crumpled piece of paper in your hand—a address scrawled in haste, but it might as well be written in another language for all the sense it makes to you now.

You stop to catch your breath, leaning against a lamppost as people rush past you, their faces blurred and indifferent. You try to ask for directions, but no one seems to understand you. One person shrugs and mutters something in a language you don’t recognize. Another laughs and points down a random street before hurrying away. You spin around, feeling a growing sense of panic as the minutes tick by.

You pull out your phone to check the time, but the screen is cracked and unresponsive. You shake it, but it stays dark, as though the city itself has swallowed your connection to the outside world. You glance up at the sky—clouds swirl in strange, unnatural patterns, and the sun seems to be in the wrong place entirely. Time feels… off, as though it’s stretching and compressing in ways that don’t make sense.

You start to move again, your sense of direction failing you completely. Every street you turn down looks unfamiliar, and the numbers on the buildings seem to jump around as you try to read them. You pass by a shop with a sign that reads “221B” one moment, and when you glance back, it says “314.” You quicken your pace, your heart in your throat.

Suddenly, you hear footsteps behind you. They’re light, almost too light, as though someone is trying not to be heard. You spin around, but there’s no one there—or at least, no one you can see. The sound stops, and for a moment, the city is eerily quiet. Then, a faint whisper seems to echo in your ear: “You’re running out of time.”

You take off in a sprint, not knowing where you’re going but driven by a primal urgency. The buildings around you begin to blur together, their colors bleeding into one another like watercolors in the rain. You feel like you’re trapped in a painting, one that’s shifting and warping as you try to navigate it.

Somewhere in the distance, you hear the faint chiming of a clock. It’s a familiar sound, but it’s muffled, as though it’s coming from underwater. You follow the sound instinctively, your legs burning with exhaustion. The chiming grows louder, and you turn a corner to see a massive clock tower looming above the skyline. The hands are spinning in circles, faster and faster, until they’re a blur.

You slump against the wall of the nearest building, your breath ragged and your mind racing. The clock tower feels like a cruel joke, a reminder of how little time you have. But then, something catches your eye—a small, unassuming door tucked between two much larger buildings. It’s slightly ajar, and you could swear you see a sliver of light coming from inside.

Without thinking, you push the door open and step through it. The city behind you fades into silence, replaced by the echoing stillness of… something else. You don’t know where you are, but you have a feeling you’re about to find out.
