nod quickly, pretending confidence, though your heart races like a trapped bird. The fluorescent lights above flicker strangely — no one notices but you. Every ticking second feels bloated, surreal.

You turn to your computer, but instead of your familiar desktop, the screen glows with endless lines of code in a language you’ve never seen, constantly shifting like waves. You reach for the keyboard, and it stretches away like taffy, your hands sinking into it like warm water. Panic flares — what are you even supposed to do?

Your boss, now inexplicably speaking in reverse, hovers at your side, scribbling mathematical symbols into the air, which hang there, pulsing. The office around you begins to dissolve into mist, partitions melting into fog. You try to ask for help, but when you open your mouth, a cascade of paper butterflies pours out instead of words.

Then — suddenly — a window opens in the wall, where no window has ever been. Sunlight streams through. Outside, you see a vast field of desks stretching to the horizon, each with a mirror version of yourself typing away, some asleep, some weeping, others staring directly at you.

One gets up.

It begins to walk toward the window, toward you.

You can’t move. You can only watch.

Just as this doppelgänger reaches the frame, your office floor tilts violently — and you begin to fall, not down, but sideways — through the desks, through the air, through a tunnel made of glowing file folders and unread emails, all laughing in voices that sound like your own.

And then — silence.

You land softly… in your bed.

The alarm clock flashes 3:33 a.m.

But as you sit up, heart pounding, you notice a sticky note on your bedside table that wasn’t there when you fell asleep. In your handwriting, it says:

**“Deadline: Midnight. Don’t trust the mirrors.”**  

Would you like to keep dreaming?
