I start to run. My bare feet slap against cool, polished marble floors that stretch out endlessly in all directions, reflecting a sky that is simultaneously a bruised twilight purple and a blinding, midday white.

The buildings aren’t made of brick or steel, but of shifting, translucent glass that shows scenes from my past playing out behind the panes—like television screens submerged in deep water. To my left, I see myself as a child learning to ride a bike; to my right, a version of me argues with someone whose face is blurred.

I reach into the pocket of my trench coat, expecting my phone, but instead, I pull out a handful of wet autumn leaves and a small, brass compass. The compass needle isn’t pointing North; it’s spinning lazily, aiming instead at the center of my own chest.

"Time is a circle," a street vendor says from a stand that sells floating lanterns. He has the face of a childhood friend but the voice of my current boss. "The meeting is always starting, and always ending."

I ask him for directions, but my voice makes no sound. The air tastes like ozone and cinnamon.

He points down a hallway that has opened up inside the side of a skyscraper. It’s a long, carpeted corridor lined with doors. One door is marked *‘Regret,’* another *‘Potential,’* and a third, slightly ajar, simply says *‘Tuesday.’*

I sprint toward the open door. As I get closer, the brass compass grows hot in my hand. I look down at it one last time and realize the needle has stopped moving. It is pointing straight up, toward the meeting that I know, with a sudden, sinking certainty, isn't a business conference at all, but the moment I am about to wake up.
