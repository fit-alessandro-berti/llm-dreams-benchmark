...as the storm worsened, and my face blurred beneath the lash of saltwater spray, I felt a knot tightening in my stomach—not of nerves, but of recognition. This wasn't a storm born of angry sky or surging tides. This was remembered. 

My ship – The Stalker – was ancient; crafted from a dark, dense ironwood I hadn't consciously placed there.  It wasn't responding to commands, neither shout nor flag. Instead, each time I issued an order, echoes rippled within me – ghostly whispers of voices that weren’t truly mine. They suggested deviations, subtly urging me away from solid tactics, toward… chaos.

My FirstMate, Silas, was wrestling with a sail, his broad shoulders straining with effort. He was younger than I expected, a startlingly blue-eyed boy beside grizzled veterans.  “Report, Elias!” he barked over the wind. “What course will you take?”

It was impossible to answer truthfully. Everything pulsed with the feeling of a half-memory, a submerged city struggling to recall its form out of the darkness. Looking down, I saw the waves weren't just churning; they *twisted*, spiraling inwards as if drawn to me, reflecting a fractured image in the deep: a skeletal hand reaching up.

"We... we need to steer *inward*!" I finally shouted, then coven the word with a panicked wave of my hand, pulling back as if a sudden, sharp pain had sliced across my brow. “Into the heart... toward the shadow…” The crew murmured, their faces etched with a strange blend of fear and longing.  

Behind Silas, old Bartholomew – our master gunner, a man who’d seen more than most – slowly lowered a pistol, his eyes fixed on something beyond me. “The sea… she responds to emotion, Captain. Feel it *hard.* Let the terror fuel our journey.”

And then I heard it, not a roar, but a single, clear thought, echoing in my very bones: *’Become lost. Remember the fall.’*  

Suddenly, I understood. This wasn't a ship fighting the storm; it *was* made *of* it. It craved darkness. It *wanted* to drown. Despair threatened to overwhelm, but with another forceful effort, I pushed against it. 


Instead of battling the relentless push into the deep, I did the opposite. I pictured a beacon blazing bright, a single point of unyielding gold in the encroaching black.  I didn’t order a course. I *felt* the desire for escape, not survival, a desperate hunger for recognition. 



Taking a shaky, deliberate breath, I gripped the helm, pouring all my will into that single point of light. 


And with a bone-jarring shudder, The Stalker began to move - not *away* from the heart of the storm, but *into* it... spiralling with it, swallowed whole by the tempest – only the gold, bright and unwavering, pulsed within the absolute black, a silent promise whispered across a boundless, chaotic sea. 


Then... nothing. Silence. 

And I woke, damp with sweat, the faint taste of salt on my lips – remembering suddenly, I hadn’t just *dreamt* the ship.  I had *built* it.
