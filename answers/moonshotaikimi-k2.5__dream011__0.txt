 ...written in a language that hasn't been invented yet, yet I understand them perfectly. The ink swims across the page like tadpoles in warm water, rearranging themselves into questions about moments I haven't lived.

**Question 1:** *Describe the sound of your mother's voice on the day you realize you've become her. Use only the color blue.*

**Question 2:** *If regret weighs 3.2 pounds, calculate the velocity required to outrun the version of yourself who turned left at the intersection in 2019. Show your work in the margins using coffee stains and moonlight.*
