You step toward the blank canvas, and as you do, the colors around you begin to shift in response—like a living, breathing entity. The canvas itself seems to hum, its surface rippling with latent energy.

A whisper cuts through the dream: *"Choose."*

Your hand hovers over the canvas. The moment you make contact, the world explodes into motion. The blankness becomes a swirling vortex of hues—deep violet bleeding into crimson, which twists into gold, which melts into emerald green. The colors don’t just *appear*; they *think*. They rearrange themselves in patterns that resemble faces, or constellations, or something far older.

Then, the shapes start moving. A triangle detaches from the canvas and floats into the air, stretching into a tower that reaches into the sky. It splits into two, then four, forming a labyrinth of geometric paths. You step onto one, and the ground beneath you dissolves into a mirror. Your reflection isn’t quite you—it’s a version of you with eyes made of stars.

The reflection lifts a finger and points. Beyond the mirror, a door appears, its surface carved with symbols that shift as you watch. The words *"Open me"* appear in a language you somehow understand.

You reach for the handle.

The dream doesn’t end. It *changes*.
