awaken from your dream, feeling grateful for the strangers who offered to guide you. As you take a deep breath, you realize you are in a familiar room, back in your own bed. The city in your dream may have been a metaphor for the complex emotions and challenges you've been facing in reality. The strangers who helped you might represent the friends, family, or support systems around you who are ready to assist you when you're feeling lost.
