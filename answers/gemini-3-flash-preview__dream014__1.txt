...reach out and take the hand of a woman whose coat seems woven from the city’s own neon lights. As your fingers meet, the deafening roar of the traffic softens into the rhythmic hum of a distant cello. The towering skyscrapers begin to sway like giant stalks of wheat in a gentle breeze, their windows shimmering like stars brought down to earth.

The strangers don’t ask for your address or a map. Instead, they lead you down an alleyway that smells unexpectedly of rain-drenched jasmine and old books. With every step, the heavy weight in your chest grows lighter, as if you are unlearning the very concept of being lost.

You realize the pavement beneath your feet has turned into a path of soft, glowing moss. The group stops before a door that wasn't there a moment ago—a door carved from a single, solid piece of moonlight. They smile, not with their mouths, but with a radiance that feels like a physical embrace, and you understand that they aren't leading you to a street or a landmark.

You step through the door and find yourself standing exactly where you started, in the heart of the square. But the city is no longer a maze of cold concrete; it is a vibrant tapestry where every shadow belongs and every light has a name. You realize that you weren't looking for a destination, but for the realization that you were never truly separate from the crowd. 

You breathe in the cool, silver air, and as the dream begins to dissolve into the morning light, you carry with you the one thing you came for: the quiet, unshakable knowledge that you are exactly where you are supposed to be.
