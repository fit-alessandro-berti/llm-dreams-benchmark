You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find water. Badly.** 

The air is thick with the scent of woodsmoke and something earthy, almost primal. Gone are the hum of electricity and the endless glow of screens. In their place, the rhythmic clang of a blacksmith’s hammer, the bleating of sheep, and the chatter of voices speaking a language vaguely familiar but largely incomprehensible. 

I’m standing on a dirt path, hemmed in by fields of golden wheat swaying in a gentle breeze. Houses, built of stone and timber, huddle together against the elements. People dressed in roughspun fabrics stare at me – my jeans and t-shirt feeling ridiculously out of place. A woman clutching a basket of herbs eyes me with suspicion.

My throat is parched, a sandpaper rasp. My head throbs. Panic prickles at the edges of my awareness. I try to speak, to ask where I am, but only a jumble of confused sounds escapes.  The woman shrinks back, muttering something in the unfamiliar tongue.

I push past the initial disorientation, focusing on the immediate need. Water. It's a primal imperative, overriding the fear and confusion. I scan the landscape.  There’s a stream glimmering in the distance, winding its way through the fields.  

My legs feel weak, my body heavy. This isn’t a vacation, it’s a survival situation. I need to reach that stream, and I need to find a way to understand… *everything*. But first, water. 

With renewed determination, I start walking towards the glimmering promise of the stream, knowing that the next few days will be a desperate scramble to adapt and survive in a world utterly unlike my own.  And I have a sinking feeling finding that water will be just the first of many challenges.
