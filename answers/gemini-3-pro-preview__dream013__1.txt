...notice that the logic begins to bleed into the physical world. The stone walls aren't made of rock anymore; they are constructed from the equations I just solved, vibrating with glowing variables.

The puzzles stop requiring math and start requiring feelings. To open the next gate, I don't have to calculate a trajectory; I have to remember the exact weight of a silence I once heard in a library. As I solve it, gravity shifts 90 degrees to the left, and I realize I am not walking through the maze—I am the maze, rearranging myself to find a way out before the alarm clock tears the walls down.
