delicate engravings swirling along its surface — patterns that seem to shift subtly in the corner of your eye. Tiny symbols, unfamiliar yet strangely comforting, glow faintly in shades of silver and deep indigo. You run your fingers across the etched lines, and a pulse of warmth spreads through your fingertips. The symbols rearrange themselves under your touch, forming a language you instinctively understand, though you've never seen it before.

It whispers: *"To open, recall what was never lost."*

Confused but intrigued, you remember something — not a memory exactly, more like a feeling — the scent of rain on old stone, the laughter of someone you miss but can't name, a familiar tune you can’t place. The moment you let yourself feel it without needing to control it, the box clicks softly.

The lid lifts on its own.

Inside is a small silver mirror with a swirling mist trapped beneath the glass. When you look into it, you don’t see yourself… instead, you see a path made of stardust stretching through a vast, dark sky. Floating above the path are glowing orbs — dreams, perhaps — each holding a fragment of a forgotten truth.

Do you step through and follow the path, or stay and examine the box further?
