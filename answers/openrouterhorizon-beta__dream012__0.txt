…plant your feet wide on the heaving deck and lift your voice above the wind.

“Hands to your stations! Reef the mainsail—now!”

The crew springs into motion, slickers flashing in the lightning, boots thudding on wet planks. The storm’s edge hammers the hull like a giant’s fist. You feel the whole ship shudder, the timbers groaning, every nail singing in its socket. Salt spray lashes your face, sharp as needles; the taste wakes something steady and old inside you, a muscle memory older than fear.

“Port ten!” you shout to the helm. The wheel fights back, knuckles blanching as your quartermaster leans his weight into it. The prow answers reluctantly, then with conviction, carving a new angle into the oncoming waves. For a heartbeat, the sky splits open: a white vein of lightning flares, painting the world in stark bone-light. In that flash you glimpse what lies ahead—not rocks, not reefs, but a towering wall of water rearing like a black cathedral.

“We ride it,” you say, and your voice is calm. “On my mark.”

Time narrows. The ship climbs—planks quiver, rigging screams—then hangs at the lip of the wave, a brief, breathless pause above a churning abyss. You count to three. On two, you exhale. On three, you drop your hand.

“Now!”

The bow knifes down the slope. Wind tears at your coat, flinging it like a flag. The crew’s cries blend with the storm’s roar into a single, ragged chord. The stern lifts, the keel shudders, then you burst through white water, through foam and thunder, and the ship finds the trough beyond with a bone-deep thud. She holds. She holds.

A cheer rises, exhausted but fierce. You allow yourself one heartbeat of relief, a thin smile, then scan the horizon. The storm is no less monstrous, but you can feel it: a path through, a seam in the chaos—a darker shade of dark where the clouds thin, where the wind shifts. A way out.

“Trim to the lee. Keep her nose where the wind wants to argue,” you call, moving toward the helm. The helmsman steps aside without a word. Your hands close on the spokes. The wood is slick and living under your palms, warm from the friction of survival.

As you steer, you speak—not orders now, but stories—to keep terror from taking root. You talk about the lantern-lit tavern you’ll all find when the storm breaks, about the way a deck smells in morning sun, about the gull that stole the cook’s hat in calm seas last summer and refused to return it. Laughter flickers—tired and small, but real. It threads you all together, a line no storm can sever.

The sea rears again, but not so high; the rain slants, then thins, then needles sideways. The thunder recedes like distant drums. One by one, stars pry open the sky: pinpricks of pale fire, then whole constellations, stunned and flawless, as if the world has been scrubbed and the heavens rewound.

“Hold her true,” you whisper to the ship. “You’ve done it.”

In the hush that follows, the ocean stretches glassy and black around you, the swells long and even, the air tasting of iron and rain. Your crew drifts toward you, faces upturned, lit by the ghost-blue glow of a clearing night. Someone presses a mug into your hands. It’s hot and sweet and bracing; steam curls up and vanishes into the starlight.

“Captain,” your first mate says softly, eyes on the horizon where a pale edge of dawn is sharpening. “How’d you know which way to turn?”

You consider the question. The answer arrives as simple as breath.

“Because we were already heading there,” you say. “I just kept us from forgetting.”

The ship hums under you, alive and listening. The horizon lightens by a shade—you can almost hear the color changing. Behind you, the storm spends itself against empty water. Ahead, the world opens like a door you’ve always known was yours.

You hand the wheel back, step to the bow, and let the wind thread your hair. The crew settles into that quiet working rhythm that follows ordeal, tools clicking, ropes coiling like tame snakes on the deck. Your chest fills with a calm so deep it feels like the ocean breathing through you.

When the first sunline breaks the sea clean in half, you lift your hand again. Not to command this time, but to greet it. And in the unclaimed space between storm and day, you realize you have never been alone here—that the ship, the crew, the sea, and the sky have always been your one body learning, over and over, how to turn toward the light.
