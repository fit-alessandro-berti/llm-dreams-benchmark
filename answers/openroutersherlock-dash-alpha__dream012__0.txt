You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you climb the slick rigging to the crow's nest, wind howling like a thousand ghosts. Lightning cracks the sky, revealing massive waves curling like the tentacles of some ancient leviathan beneath the surface.

"Steady her lads!" you bellow, voice cutting through the roar. But as thunder shakes the mast, the sea splits open—a glowing whirlpool, swirling with stars and forgotten treasures. The ship plunges in, crew screaming in awe, not fear. Time warps; you glimpse pirate kings laughing from coral thrones, mermaids weaving nets of liquid silver.

You seize the wheel from a spectral helmsman, steering not away, but toward the heart. The storm births a new dawn—your ship emerges on a crystal lagoon, crew transformed into immortals, sails billowing with eternal wind. You awaken, grinning, salt still on your lips.
