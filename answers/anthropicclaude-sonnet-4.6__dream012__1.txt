...grip the wheel with both hands, knuckles white against the salt-slicked wood. The wheel fights back like something alive.

"Captain!" your first mate Sera shouts over the roar, her red hair whipping across her face like flames. "The compass — look at it!"

You glance down. The needle is spinning. Not drifting. *Spinning.* Full rotations, lazy and deliberate, as though something beneath the water is pulling at it.

And then you see what she means.

The storm isn't moving the way storms move. It's *circular*. The clouds above are rotating around your ship like you are the center of something enormous and intentional.

You are not caught in a storm.

You are the eye of it.

One of the younger crew members — a boy named Dov, barely seventeen — grabs your sleeve. "What do we do?"

And here is the strange thing about being the captain in a dream: **you know.** The knowledge arrives not from memory or training but from somewhere deeper, the way you know things in dreams — completely and without explanation.

"We go *into* it," you hear yourself say.

"That's madness," Sera whispers. But she's already moving to her station.

You push the wheel hard to port, steering directly toward the darkest wall of water, a cliff face of the ocean rising forty feet high, black and green and *roaring* —

The ship hits it.

And then —

*silence.*

The other side is a sea of glass. Midnight blue. Perfectly still. Above, not stars but something like stars — lights that drift and breathe and rearrange themselves into shapes you almost recognize.

Dov stands at the bow, looking out, his mouth open.

"Captain," he says quietly. "Where are we?"

You join him at the rail. The water beneath the hull is so clear you can see what rests on the ocean floor — vast and pale and *architectural*, like a city built by something that had never seen land.

"I don't know," you say honestly.

And somehow, that is the most captain-like thing you have ever said. Not *I know the way.* But: *I don't know, and we will find out together, and I will not pretend otherwise.*

Sera appears at your shoulder. She's smiling, which is rare for her.

"The compass stopped spinning," she says, holding it out.

The needle points straight *down.*

You laugh — a real laugh, surprised out of you — and the lights above rearrange themselves again, and this time you are almost certain they spell a word in a language you once knew and have been trying to remember your entire life.

You lean over the rail.

The city below is lit from within.

Something down there is *awake.*

And it has been waiting —

*patiently,*

*specifically,*

*for your ship to arrive.*

You take a breath of air that tastes like rain and copper and the particular smell of a library in winter, and you say to your crew, all of them watching you now, all of them frightened and radiant with it:

**"Drop anchor. We're here."**
