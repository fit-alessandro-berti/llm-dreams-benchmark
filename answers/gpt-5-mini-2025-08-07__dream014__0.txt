take their hands.

They are warm. One hums a tune you almost remember; another points with a finger that leaves a faint trail of light in the air. Nobody asks where you’re going. Instead they listen, and when you try to say “I don’t know,” the word dissolves into something softer — a map that spreads beneath your feet like spilled ink, the street names rearranging themselves into promises.

As you walk, the city loosens its sharp edges. Horns become distant percussion, neon gutters pour into a river of blue glass, and the high windows blink like patient eyes. The strangers move without hurry, not because they know exactly, but because their presence makes the way easier to notice: doors you had missed stand slightly ajar; an alley blossoms into a courtyard where warm bread is already cooling on a table; a stairwell leads not down into subway fumes but up into a cluster of hanging gardens.

One of them — an old woman with paint-splattered hands — hands you a small, ordinary thing: a coin, a pebble, a folded scrap of paper. “For if you lose the road again,” she says, although what she actually speaks sounds like wind through leaves. You tuck the object into your pocket and feel something shift inside you, like a lamp lit in a room you had forgotten.

Conversations rise around you in dozens of languages, and you understand them all without effort. They aren’t giving you directions so much as offering choices: here is a market that sells songs, there is a bridge that remembers names, that way is a theater where strangers act out your better moments. You choose, then change your mind, then choose again. Every turn is generous, full of small miracles: a child who draws a compass that always points toward what matters, a stray cat that guides you by weaving between your legs. The group walks with you until the path you need appears — not on a printed map but in the quieting of your chest.

At the place you want to be, they pause. You feel the tremor of gratitude — not for the destination but for the fact of being seen. They smile like weather clearing. One by one they melt into the city: a bench that bears a new name, a mural brightened by an extra color, a lamppost that throws a softer light. Only the coin/pebble/paper remains in your pocket, warm as an ember.

You are not fixed, not saved, not alone — merely set moving again, with a lighter step and a clearer sky overhead. The city hums on, and you walk into it, knowing strangers can show you the way, and that sometimes the way is simply the company you keep.
