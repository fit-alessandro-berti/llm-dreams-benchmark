The wind howls like a wolf at the throat of the ship, tearing at the sails and sending waves crashing against the hull with a fury that seems to crack the very bones of the sea. The crew leans over the rails, their faces gaunt with sweat and terror, as the ship pitches and rolls like a dying beast. The mast, once proud and unyielding, now creaks under the strain, its rigging fraying at the edges. The sails, once a banner of hope, are now tattered shreds, whipping in the gale like the last gasps of a broken heart.  

You grip the wheel with white-knuckled hands, the wood splintering under your grip, and feel the weight of their eyes on you—their fear, their exhaustion, their silent prayers. You’ve seen this storm before, in dreams and in memory: the one that took your father’s ship, the one that carved the horizon into a jagged scar. But this is different. This storm is alive, and it’s testing you.  

“Hold the course!” you bellow, your voice raw, as the ship heels to the left, threatening to capsize. A sailor, his leg bloodied from a splintered deck, reaches for the helm, but you shove him back. “You don’t know the sea, boy. I do.”  

The wind rips the sails further, and the ship is tossed by a wave that seems to rise from the depths, a monster with eyes. You feel the ship’s soul, its ancient bones groaning in protest. You remember the old sea witch who told you, *“The storm doesn’t break—it only bares the soul of the sailor.”*  

Then, in the chaos, you see it: a glint of light through the storm, a fragment of the moon reflected in the water. You shout, “To the star! We’re not lost!” The crew stumbles to their feet, their fear momentarily eclipsed by the flicker of hope. You steer the ship toward the light, through the teeth of the storm, and for a moment, the world holds still.  

The ship is battered, the mast broken, and the horizon is a bruised gray. But the storm has passed, leaving the sea eerily quiet. You look down at the crew, their faces etched with exhaustion and awe. The star above is dim, but it’s there.  

You feel the weight of the storm in your chest, a scar that will never fade. The sea is still, but the horizon is a mystery again. And somewhere in the distance, the wind whispers a new question: *What will you face next?*
