…find two things as quickly as possible: water and answers.

1. The Thirst  
The sun that greets you is surprisingly sharp, the air unfiltered by factories or fumes. Your tongue, however, feels as if you have slept on desert sand. You stumble down a narrow dirt track bordered by waist‑high wheat. At its end a brook chatters over stones. You kneel, drink, and realize—almost with embarrassment—that the taste is the best you have ever known. No chlorine, no metal. Just water. Your first lesson: nothing here is effortless, but what you earn will be pure.

2. A Village From a Tapestry  
Following the brook, you crest a hill and see it: wooden palisades, thatched roofs, smoke curling from clay chimneys. 11th‑century? 12th? Enough history documentaries flicker through your mind to give you a rough estimate, but dates don’t matter when your stomach growls. Chickens scatter as you enter the main lane. A baker’s boy eyes your strange clothes—T‑shirt, sneakers—then scampers away shouting, “Cunning‑man! Cunning‑man!”

3. The Need to Blend  
You have seconds to decide: run, hide, or improvise. You remember rule one of every time‑travel story—belong or be burned. You pull off your printed jacket, turn it inside‑out so the logo vanishes, smear a little clay on your jeans, and slip behind the baker’s stall. When the villagers arrive, led by a bearded reeve gripping a staff, you are already kneading dough.  

“Stranger,” he says, suspicious, “whence come you?”  
You answer with the first accent that springs to mind—a half‑remembered Yorkshire lilt from a TV drama. “From up‑way, good sir. The old road by the quarry. Looking for honest employ.”  
He watches your fingers folding the dough with unsettling speed—one modern skill translates well: you’ve made sourdough during lockdowns. Impressed, he grunts. “Breadwright died o’ the fever yesterweek. Oven’s yours till Lammas if you keep the loaves light.”

Just like that, you have a place.

4. Reinventing the Future, Quietly  
Nights are lit by tallow, so you build tiny reflectors from hammered scrap to double the brightness. You sketch a simple lever press to spare the baker’s shoulders. Villagers nod at your “clever northern tricks,” unaware these are kindergarten‑level hacks from centuries ahead.

But one invention you keep to yourself: penicillin‐mold scraped from a forgotten crust. A fevered child in the cottage next door forces your hand. You brew a crude broth, administer it. The child lives; the reeve kneels, calling you saint. Panic grips you—saints become martyrs in the wrong rumor.

5. The Eclipsed Moon  
Word spreads beyond the palisade. One dusk, a horseman in chainmail dismounts. He carries a scroll sealed with dark wax: the Earl’s summons. You are to present yourself at the stone circle on the next full moon—an eclipse night—“to advise on matters celestial.” Translation: demonstrate your magic or die.

You could run into the forests and vanish, but you remember the eclipse tables you memorized for fun back home. Maybe the sky itself can be your shield.

6. The Stone Circle  
The night arrives copper‑red, the moon slipping into Earth’s shadow like a coin into water. Nobles and peasants gasp. You step atop a fallen monolith, speak loudly:

“This darkness is no curse but the turning of heavenly gears. Count the heartbeats: when I finish a hundred, light will return.”

You begin. The crowd holds its breath. At heartbeat ninety‑seven the first silver bite appears on the moon’s rim. Gasps turn to cheers. No one notices your own trembling—because at that moment the lunar light strikes the carved lintel behind you, illuminating a spiral identical to the one on your childhood night‑light.

The stones hum—or is it your pulse? The world tilts. The cheers fade like a receding tide.

7. Awakening, Again  
You jerk upright in your own bed. Morning traffic mutters outside, phone buzzing with notifications. You touch your lips: a phantom taste of brook water lingers. On your bedside table sits a single round loaf, perfectly baked, still warm.

Your dream gives you no grand machine, no gold. Instead it leaves you with simpler instructions scrawled on the crust in floury finger‑strokes:

Earn what is pure.  
Belong where you stand.  
Use what you know.  

You break the bread, letting the crumbs fall like tiny grains of unrecorded history, and start your day a century older and—somehow—years younger.
