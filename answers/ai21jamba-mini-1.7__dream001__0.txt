You start to panic slightly but quickly take a deep breath, calmly assessing your surroundings. The city skyline glimmers with towering skyscrapers, but something about the architecture feels strange—almost futuristic, with curved glass buildings and monorail tracks cutting through the skyline. In front of you, a massive digital billboard scrolls news headlines and weather updates in a language you don’t quite recognize but somehow understand.

You pull out your phone, expecting it to give you directions, but the screen flickers, and a holographic map appears. At the top, it reads, "You are at Nexus Point." Below, a trail of glowing blue dots appears, leading into the distance. You follow the trail, hoping it will guide you to your meeting.

As you walk, you notice the streets are unusually quiet for a city this size. The only sound comes from the occasional hum of electric vehicles passing above on elevated roads, leaving the ground level eerily still. People glide past on hoverboards or small personal drones, barely acknowledging you as they pass. Occasional holographic ads pop up, projecting in midair before vanishing.

You follow the glowing path, winding through narrow alleys adorned with neon graffiti that pulses like living art. The trail finally leads to a massive dome-shaped building shimmering with rainbow-colored glass. The entrance is guarded by two towering robots with glowing blue eyes. They scan you, then one says, "Meeting in progress—access granted."

You step inside, the door sliding shut behind you, and find yourself in a grand hall filled with holographic projections floating in midair. Each projection is a miniaturized 3D map of the city, glowing faintly as others interact with them. Your name is called, and a voice echoes, “You are exactly where you need to be.”

You step forward, and as you touch one of the holographic maps, the world around you shifts. Buildings fold into each other like puzzle pieces, and the city transforms into a massive, pulsating circuit board. At its center, a glowing node pulses with light, and you feel a strange sense of connection, as if you’ve been here before, in another time, in another dream.

The voice speaks again, clearer now: "The future waits for no one, but it never forgets."

Suddenly, you're no longer dreaming. You wake with a jolt, the memory of the city fading like mist, but the sense of purpose lingers. You realize you've been preparing for this meeting your entire life. The city? It was never just a place. It was you.
