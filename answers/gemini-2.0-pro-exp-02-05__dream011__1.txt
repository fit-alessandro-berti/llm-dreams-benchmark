...written in a language I've never seen before. It's not just that the words are unfamiliar; the *characters* themselves are alien. They swirl and twist, like miniature galaxies captured on the page, pulsing with a faint, inner light. My heart hammers against my ribs. I look around the vast examination hall, but everyone else is scribbling away furiously, brows furrowed in concentration.

Am I the only one seeing this?

I try to ask the invigilator, a stern-faced woman with a bun so tight it seems to pull her eyes back, but when I open my mouth, only a croaking sound emerges. My throat is dry, my palms slick with sweat. I pick up my pen, the familiar weight suddenly foreign and useless in my hand.

Then, one of the galactic symbols on the page seems to… *shift*. It morphs, briefly, into a single, recognizable word: “Breathe.”

I take a deep, shaky breath, trying to calm the rising panic. As I exhale, another symbol clarifies: "Imagine."

And that’s when it hits me. This isn't a test of knowledge, it's a test of… something else. Something I can't quite grasp yet. I close my eyes, forcing myself to clear my mind. I imagine a simple object – a red apple, the kind I used to eat as a child. When I open my eyes, one of the swirling symbols has resolved itself into a picture, not quite a photograph, but a perfect, shimmering representation of the apple I’d envisioned.

A thrill, a spark of understanding, ignites within me. This exam isn't about what I *know*; it's about what I can *create*. It's about shaping the raw, swirling potential of this strange language into something meaningful. This isn’t an exam; it's a conversation. A conversation with… what? My future? Myself? The universe?

Slowly, hesitantly, I begin. I imagine a question, a yearning that's been buried deep inside me for years: "What is my purpose?" And on the page, the swirling symbols begin to dance, forming a response… but it’s not words. It’s a feeling, a burgeoning sensation of flight, of soaring above towering mountains and shimmering oceans, a breathtaking vista stretching out before me, limitless and unknown. A feeling of… possibility.
