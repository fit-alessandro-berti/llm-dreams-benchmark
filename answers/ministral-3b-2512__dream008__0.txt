**Dream Continuation:**

The clock on the wall ticks loudly, but the numbers don’t seem to move—just spin in slow motion. Your boss, arms crossed, leans forward with that same tired smile, their voice dripping with urgency: *"We need this by tomorrow. No excuses. The client’s going to kill us if we’re late."* You swallow hard, your stomach twisting like a knot. The project? It’s a sprawling, multi-layered puzzle—one that’s been gathering dust in your inbox for months, with half-finished notes, scattered files, and a team that’s already half-heartedly working on it.

You glance at your desk. A half-empty coffee cup sits there, steam still curling from the surface. The keyboard is cold. The mouse is dead. The only thing that feels alive is the faint hum of your phone, buzzing with notifications—emails from colleagues asking, *"What’s going on?"* You ignore them. Right now, you need to *create* something from nothing.

Then—*a whisper*. Not in your head, but in the air. A voice, soft but insistent: *"You don’t have to do it alone."* You turn. Standing behind you, half-hidden in the shadows of the cubicle wall, is someone you haven’t seen in years—a childhood friend, a mentor, even a stranger who once saved you from a panic attack. They’re holding a single, glowing object—a small, silver key, pulsing faintly. *"This unlocks the first layer,"* they murmur. *"But you’ll need to prove you’re worth it."*

Your fingers tremble as you reach for it. The key fits perfectly into the lock of your computer screen. Suddenly, the files aren’t just scattered—they’re *arranged*, like a map. A timeline unfolds before you: a series of choices, each one leading to a different outcome. The impossible deadline isn’t a deadline at all. It’s a *test*.

You take a deep breath. The first choice is simple: **Do you trust the key, or do you try to force the project yourself?**

*(Would you like to explore a different path? Maybe the key leads to a hidden team, or the boss is hiding something? Or perhaps the dream shifts to a surreal workplace where time itself is the enemy?)*
