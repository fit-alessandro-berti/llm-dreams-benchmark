You are participating in a competition where the grand prize is your dream job. As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and the arena keeps changing shape—one moment it’s a maze made of filing cabinets, the next it’s a stage where you have to improvise a presentation to a crowd of faceless judges. You stumble at first, tripping over your own doubts, but every time you think you’re out, someone you met along the way tosses you a clue or a smile.

In the final round, the other contestants melt into the scenery, and you’re alone in a room that looks exactly like your childhood bedroom. On the desk sits a single envelope with your name on it. When you open it, there’s no job offer, just a blank sheet of paper. A voice you recognize as your own says, “Write it.” You pick up a pen and the blank page fills with words, projects, and ideas you didn’t know you had.

The room dissolves into a bright office filled with the work you’ve always wanted to do, and a key drops into your hand. Cheers swell around you, but before you can turn the key, your alarm starts to ring.

You wake up with your heart racing and the feeling that you’re already halfway there.
