stand tall on the prow, the wind whipping your salt-crusted coat like the claws of some ancient leviathan. Lightning cracks the sky, illuminating the faces of your crew—wide-eyed, trembling, their faith in you a fragile anchor against the chaos. "Hold fast!" you bellow, voice cutting through the roar like a blade. With a surge of dream-born certainty, you seize the wheel, feeling the ship's timbers pulse beneath your hands like a living heart.

The waves rise like mountains, crashing over the deck, but you laugh—wild, defiant—because in this dream, you *know* the storm's secret. You spot it: a rift in the clouds, swirling with ethereal light, the eye of the tempest whispering your name. "To the light!" you command, spinning the wheel hard. The crew scrambles, ropes snapping, sails straining as the ship surges forward, plowing through walls of water that shatter like glass.

As you breach the eye, the world inverts. The sea becomes sky, stars bloom from the foam, and your crew transforms into glowing sirens, singing praises. The storm? It was never your enemy—just a veil. You awaken on deck under a calm dawn, the ship gliding into a harbor of floating islands, crew cheering. But as you blink, the dream fades, leaving only the echo of waves... and the salt on your lips.
