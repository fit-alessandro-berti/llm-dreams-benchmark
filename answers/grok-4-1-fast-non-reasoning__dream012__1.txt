You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you stand tall at the helm, salt spray whipping your face like a thousand tiny needles. Lightning cracks the sky, illuminating the massive waves that rear up like vengeful gods, threatening to swallow the creaking wooden vessel whole.

"Steady now, lads!" you bellow over the howling wind, your voice a thunder of its own. The crew—grizzled sailors with eyes wide as the abyss—clings to ropes and rails, their faces etched with fear. You've sailed through worse, or so you tell yourself, but this storm feels alive, malevolent, as if the sea itself hungers for your souls.

A rogue wave crashes over the bow, sweeping two men overboard into the churning black. Panic ripples through the deck. You grip the wheel, muscles straining against the ship's wild yawing, and spot a faint glow on the horizon—not lightning, but something ethereal, a beacon pulsing like a heartbeat.

"To the light!" you command, pointing with iron resolve. The crew scrambles to adjust the sails, hauling lines slick with rain. The ship surges forward, plowing through foam-flecked mountains of water. Thunder roars approval or warning—you can't tell which.

As you draw nearer, the glow reveals itself: a colossal whirlpool, swirling with iridescent colors, whispering secrets in voices that tug at your mind. Is it salvation or doom? Your first mate grabs your arm. "Captain, she'll drag us under!"

But in the dream's fevered logic, you laugh—a wild, defiant bark—and steer straight in. The ship spirals down, down into the vortex, the crew's screams blending with an otherworldly chorus. Colors explode: sapphire depths, emerald lights, visions of forgotten islands and siren songs.

You awaken drenched in sweat, the storm's echo fading, the ship's wheel still warm in your phantom grip. What lingers? The thrill of the plunge... or the pull to dive back in?
