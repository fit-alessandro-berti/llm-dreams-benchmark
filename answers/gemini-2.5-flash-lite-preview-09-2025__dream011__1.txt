You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are **written in shimmering, impossibly small calligraphy on the inside of your own eyelids.**

You blink once, and the world goes momentarily black, the tiny script burning itself onto your vision. You try to rub your eyes, but your hands feel impossibly heavy, rooted to the desk by invisible amber. Panic starts to bubble—this is the moment, the turning point, and you can’t even read the prompt!

Then, a slow, profound realization dawns: **You don't need to read them.**

The questions aren't intended for your conscious mind. They are demands placed upon your *essence*. As you focus, not on the letters, but on the space between your eyes, the pressure increases. Suddenly, the knowledge required floods your mind, not as recalled facts, but as *instinctual certainty*.

The first question appears: **"Define the sound of silence."**

You open your mouth, and instead of speech, a single, perfect, crystalline **note** emerges—a note that tastes like ozone and the color indigo. The note hangs in the air, vibrating the very paper on the desk.

The second question materializes: **"What color is regret?"**

Before you can answer, the ambient light in the examination hall—a sickly fluorescent yellow—shifts. It deepens, coalesces, and then pours itself directly into your throat, coating your tongue in a thick, metallic **bronze**. This is the answer. The bronze flavor *is* the color of regret.

The proctor, a tall figure whose face is perpetually obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat, nods slowly. He doesn't use a pen to mark your paper; instead, he gestures toward the wall.

The wall dissolves, not into bricks or plaster, but into a vast, swirling nebula of possibilities.

The final question isn't written anywhere. It simply *is*: **"Choose the next path."**

You look down at your hands, which are no longer heavy. They are translucent, made of pure, humming light. You realize the exam wasn't about proving what you *knew*; it was about proving what you were *willing to become*.

With a deep breath that pulls in the scent of distant stars, you step forward, not onto the floor, but into the brightest, fiercest part of the nebula, ready for the career of pure, unquantifiable being.

The exam is over. The *life* begins.
