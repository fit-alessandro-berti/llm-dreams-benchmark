...feel the air grow colder and the walls closer, their stone surfaces shifting subtly when you’re not looking directly at them. The puzzles become less about logic and more about intuition—pieces that don’t fit until you stop trying to force them, riddles that answer themselves when you hum a half-remembered lullaby from childhood.

Then, you reach a chamber unlike the others. The floor is a mosaic of constellations you’ve never seen, and at its center floats a door made entirely of mirrors. Each reflection shows a different version of you: younger, older, braver, afraid—but all with the same weary eyes that have been navigating this maze for what feels like lifetimes.

A whisper echoes—not from the walls, but from inside your own chest: *“The final puzzle isn’t to escape. It’s to choose which you is real.”*

You reach out, not toward the door, but toward your own reflection. The glass ripples like water, and as your fingers pass through, the maze doesn’t end…

…it remembers you.

And suddenly, you’re standing in your childhood bedroom, rain tapping the window, the scent of old books and warm toast in the air. The puzzles are gone. But your hands still tremble with the memory of solving them.

You wake up—but something in your pocket feels oddly warm. You reach in and pull out a small, smooth stone etched with a symbol from the last puzzle. It pulses once, gently, like a heartbeat.
