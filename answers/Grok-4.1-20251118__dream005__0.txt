...and each group pulls you in like gravity, even though you swear you’re just passing through.

First, there’s a circle of old men in tuxedos playing cards on a grand piano that’s somehow floating two feet off the ground. They don’t look up, but one slides a chair out for you with his foot and mutters, “Sit. You’re already losing.” You sit. The cards are blank. Every time you flip one, it shows a different childhood memory you’d forgotten you had. The men nod approvingly when you flinch.

You excuse yourself—politely, frantically—and drift toward the next cluster: a group of teenagers taking selfies with a polar bear that keeps photobombing them by breathing frost onto the lens. One girl turns to you and says, “Hold this,” handing you a lit sparkler that’s somehow also a lit cigarette that’s somehow also a birthday candle. You take it because refusing feels ruder than third-degree burns. The polar bear winks. You move on before anyone sings.

The ballroom keeps stretching, doors appearing where walls were a second ago. You pass a conga line of identical versions of your dentist, all wearing Hawaiian shirts and chanting the exact time you’re supposed to floss. You wave. They wave back with those little mirrors. You speed up.

Then you spot them—the one person you know—across the room, standing alone by a chocolate fountain that’s flowing upward. Relief floods you. You push through the crowd, apologizing to a woman made entirely of stained-glass feathers, stepping over a corgi in a tuxedo vest who’s solving a Rubik’s cube with its paws.

You’re ten feet away when the person you came with turns around.

It’s you.

Not a mirror, not a twin—*you*, but calmer, wearing the outfit you almost wore tonight, holding a drink you don’t remember ordering. They smile like they’ve been waiting years.

“Hey,” dream-you says, voice soft, “I’ve been looking everywhere for you.”

And before you can ask what the hell that means, they hand you the upward-flowing chocolate like it’s the most natural thing in the world and say:

“Your turn to find me.”

Then the lights cut out, the music stops, and every group you met starts clapping in perfect unison—slow, inevitable—like they’ve all been in on it from the start.

You wake up tasting sparkler smoke and dentist mint, heart racing, wondering which one of you is late to the party now.
