feel a surge of confidence building within you. Quickly, you glance down to your notes, but notice they're blank pages. Instead of panicking, you take a deep breath and begin speaking from your heart. Your words flow effortlessly and clearly, connecting deeply with everyone in the audience. The faces that were once blank with expectation now soften into smiles and nods of understanding.

With each word, the stage behind you gently transforms into a serene landscape: lush rolling hills, bright sunshine bathing the fields in gold, and birds soaring happily overhead. Surprised yet delighted, you invite your audience to share this magical moment with you, and one by one, they begin stepping onto the stage, embraced by the comforting warmth and endless beauty of the scenery.

Gradually, your speech becomes a joyful conversation, laughter echoing as ideas flow openly and passionately among you all. Filled with a profound sense of community and warmth, you realize this is no ordinary speech—this is a moment of genuine connection, creativity, and unity.

As the dream gently fades, you awaken feeling empowered, peaceful, and full of gratitude for the courage you found within yourself.
