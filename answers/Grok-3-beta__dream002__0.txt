the sky darkens, casting an eerie shadow over the trees. The wind picks up, rustling the leaves with an almost urgent whisper, and you notice the air growing heavy with the scent of rain. Thunder rumbles in the distance, a low growl that seems to shake the ground beneath your feet. You quicken your pace, searching for shelter, when you spot a faint glow ahead—a flickering light filtering through the branches. As you approach, the storm breaks, rain pelting down in thick sheets, and the light reveals an ancient, ivy-covered cabin. The door creaks open on its own, inviting you in. You step inside, dripping wet, and find a crackling fire already burning in the hearth, though the cabin appears deserted. A strange warmth envelops you, and for a moment, you feel as though the storm itself has guided you here. Then, you hear it—a soft, melodic hum coming from somewhere deeper within the cabin, drawing you forward into the unknown.
