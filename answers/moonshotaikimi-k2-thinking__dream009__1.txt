...find water. The thought emerges crystal clear, cutting through the fog in your mind. Your tongue feels thick and alien, and the wool tunic scratching at your neck still smells like *someone else*.

The buildings around you are timber-framed, leaning like old teeth, and though the street is muddy, it's *improbably* clean—no plastic, no cigarette butts, just horseshit and straw. A woman passes in a wimple and you nearly laugh because she looks like a movie extra, but then she meets your eyes with genuine suspicion, not the glazed look of commuters, and your laughter dies.

You pat your pockets instinctively. No phone. No wallet. Just a small leather pouch that jingles with coins you don't remember acquiring, and a scrap of parchment with markings that swim before your eyes—your own handwriting, but you can't decode the message you left for yourself.

The sun is wrong. It's too coppery, too *present*, heating the top of your head with a weight you've never felt before. You need to find water, yes, but more urgently, you need to find out what you knew that was so important you wrote it down before... before whatever happened, happened. The parchment trembles in your hand as a bell begins to toll, and everyone around you—people who somehow feel like echoes of people you know—immediately kneels.

Everyone except you. And the figure in the window above the apothecary, who points directly at your face and begins to scream.
