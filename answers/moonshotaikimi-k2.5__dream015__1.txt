 follow the sound of piano keys drifting through the dust-choked wind.

You shouldn't. Your canteen is nearly empty, and the Geiger counter on your belt clicks in erratic staccato warnings. But the melody—Debussy, perhaps, or something that predates even the old world—is threading through the skeletal remains of skyscrapers, and you remember that you were human once, not just a scavenging animal.

You walk.

The pavement shifts beneath your boots. Sometimes it's asphalt, sometimes moss-softened cobblestones, sometimes a floor of polished marble that reflects a sky you haven't seen in years—impossibly blue, unbroken by ash clouds. The dream logic allows this. In this world, the horizon ripples like heat rising from summer concrete, and abandoned cars bloom with roses that have steel thorns and petals like torn silk.

The music grows louder. You pass through a library where books fly like murmurations of starlings, their pages rustling with whispers of stories that never happened. You take nothing, though your pack is light. The melody is resource enough.

At the city's heart—where a crater should be, where logic says there is only fused glass and radiation—you find a greenhouse made of stained glass salvaged from cathedrals. Inside, someone tends to tomatoes that glow gentle gold in the dark, and cornstalks that reach up through shattered ceiling panels to drink starlight instead of sun.

The pianist is a woman with hair like silver wire, wearing a gasmask repurposed into a helmet of blooming orchids. She doesn't look up as you enter, but her fingers pause on the yellowed keys.

"I've been waiting," she says, though her voice comes from the trumpet flowers growing along the window frames. "You brought the seeds?"

You reach into your pocket, and yes—there they are. Not the bullets or dried meat you expected, but a handful of acorns that pulse with warm light. You've been carrying them all along, though you only just remembered.

Outside, the dangers still prowl: the shadow-wolves with eyes like dying headlights, the acid rain that fell yesterday, the silence that follows. But here, in this impossible architecture of hope, you decide to stay. Not to survive—that animal urge has been satisfied too long—but to cultivate.

You place the acorns in soil that smells of cinnamon and ozone. They take root immediately, spiraling upward into supports for the glass roof, knitting it back together. The music resumes, and this time, you hum along.

Tomorrow, you'll face the wasteland again. But tonight, you dream while awake, and the dream is this: that the end of the world is just a long winter, and spring is patient, and someone must be the first to plant the garden in the graveyard.
