find way back home. Arranging the strange wooden chests stacked haphazardly, you spot a tattered tarp covering a large, open courtyard. Through the tarp, you see a flickering hearth and a collection of farm animals—though their heads are slightly too large, a quirk I hadn't anticipated.  

You approach a calloused hand, the owner of the animals, wiping sweat from his brow. He speaks in a thick, raspy voice, clearly not well-versed in my dialect.  

I stammer, trying to explain my situation—a rush of disoriented confusion—but he holds up a hand.  

"Trouble ya, traveler? You leave the trapline outta luck."  

His iron leg catches on a loose wooden plank, slowing him.  

Suddenly, a flock of geese—huge, wing-whistling—riderless and bound for the horizon, spreads out on the ground.  

Knowing nothing of the geese, he gestures to the farthest flock.  

Eyes narrowing, he whispers, "Fly right now. Follow the north star. Find the Whispering Woods and—" He clears his throat, struggling. "Hope ye can fix ya cloak. That was frayed..."  

You realize the impending adventure, and without thinking, you motion toward him, extending a hand. Before you can be caught up in his shaky words, a gust of wind—strong, earth-shaking—rises from the trees, carrying a flicker of light beyond the canopy. 

The geese begin falling—a sacred migration ritual, I later learn—but their sudden descent feels... urgent. 

I look back at him.

"And the clock's ticking to... well, not a clock. No, the seasons... or maybe something else entirely..." 

You're left standing between two worlds, and a single bird lands on your shoulder. Its eye glowers, knowing you're trapped between time itself.
