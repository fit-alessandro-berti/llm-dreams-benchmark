...written in a language youâ€™ve never seen before â€” strange symbols that seem to shift and shimmer when you look at them too long. Panic rises in your chest, but when you glance around, no one else seems fazed. They're scribbling away, their pens flying across the paper.

A voice, deep and distant, echoes through the room: "Trust your memory."  
You look back at the exam, and suddenly, some of the symbols rearrange themselves into familiar shapes â€” a map, a riddle, a melody. It clicks: this isnâ€™t a normal test; itâ€™s a test of intuition, imagination.

You close your eyes, take a deep breath, and when you open them, the exam paper has transformed into a glowing doorway in the desk. Without hesitation, you reach out and step through â€” into a vast library where the books whisper your name.

Would you like me to keep going? ðŸŒ™
