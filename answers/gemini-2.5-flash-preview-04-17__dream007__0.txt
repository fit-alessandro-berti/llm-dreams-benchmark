The air crackles with tension, every word a tiny missile. Your friend's face is contorted with frustration, and you feel a hot wave of anger washing over you. The disagreement feels insurmountable, a chasm opening between you. You feel the desperate need to break this cycle, to escape the emotional pressure cooker.

...and you decide to **simply step out of the scene.**

Not walk away, but literally *step out*. As the thought forms, the edges of your vision shimmer. Your friend's voice starts to echo and distort, like a radio signal fading out. The room, filled with the oppressive weight of your conflict, begins to wobble and blur. You take one physical step backward, and the solid floor beneath you turns soft, then fades into a swirling, indeterminate mist of colours.

You are no longer standing opposite your friend, locked in verbal combat. You are floating gently in this vibrant, silent mist. The feeling of anger and frustration evaporates instantly, replaced by a calm, detached curiosity. Below you, or perhaps beside you in the swirling colours, you can faintly see the room you were just in, miniaturized and silent, the two figures within it like distant puppets, their argument muted to an inaudible pantomime. It seems utterly unimportant now, a tiny, frantic bubble in this vast, quiet space. You drift further away, the colours shifting from vibrant blues and greens to soft, calming purples and greys, leaving the argument and its weight far behind in the dissolving dreamscape.
