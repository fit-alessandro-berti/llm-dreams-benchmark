…stand at the wheel, salt-crusted lashes blinking against the spray, one hand locked on the spokes while the other instinctively touches the old brass compass bolted to the binnacle. The needle spins like a drunk dervish (north has abandoned us tonight).

Lightning forks overhead and for a heartbeat the deck is lit corpse-white. I see them all: Elias with his broken arm cradled against his chest, young Mara clinging to the rail as if the ship itself might fly apart, old Cook weeping silently because the galley fire is drowned and he thinks that means we’re already dead.

They’re waiting for me to speak the magic words that will make the ocean forgive us.

But I have no magic. Only the truth, raw as split timber.

“Listen,” I shout over the wind, voice cracking like the mainmast above us. “The sea doesn’t hate us. She’s simply older than promises and in a foul mood tonight. We’ve stolen from her, pissed in her gardens, and named her storms after ex-lovers. She’s collecting.”

A wave the size of a cathedral slams the bow. The ship groans, rises, hesitates on the crest as if considering whether to dive straight to the bottom and be done with it.

I laugh. I can’t help it. The sound startles even me.

“That’s it, you glorious bitch,” I snarl at the storm. “Take your best swing.”

Then I turn to the crew, rain streaming off my braid like black blood.

“Reef the mainsail to ribbons if you have to. Cut away what drags us down. But we are not cargo for the deep tonight. We are the thorn in her side, the bad story she tells other oceans. We are the ones who refuse to sink politely.”

Mara’s eyes widen. Elias straightens, pain forgotten. Even Cook wipes his face and grabs a line.

I spin the wheel hard to larboard, riding the face of the next monster wave like it’s a lover who owes me money. The hull screams, timbers flexing like ribs around a breaking heart.

And somewhere in the chaos I realize the compass has stopped spinning. It points dead ahead, into the black heart of the storm (steady, certain, impossible).

The crew sees it too. A cheer rips out of them, ragged and defiant.

We are not sailing around the storm anymore.

We are going through it.

Because sometimes the only way out is straight into the teeth of the thing trying to kill you, laughing like a madman, with a crew crazy enough to follow.

Hold fast, loves. The night is young, and the sea hasn’t met a captain stubborn enough to die on a night she feels like murdering.

Not yet.
