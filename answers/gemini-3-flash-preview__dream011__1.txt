As I sit down to start the exam, I notice the questions are **not written in ink, but in shimmering, translucent threads that seem to pulse with the rhythm of my own heartbeat.**

At first, I squint, trying to find the familiar terminology of the syllabus, but the characters shift and rearrange themselves as my eyes pass over them. The first question doesn't ask for a formula or a historical date. It simply asks:

*"Question 1: What does the color of your first memory smell like?"*

I look around the hall, panicking. The other students are writing furiously, their pens scratching against the paper with a sound like dry leaves skittering across pavement. The proctor, a figure whose face is obscured by a soft, grey mist, glides past my desk and taps a long, spindly finger on the page.

I look back down. The second question has materialized, but it isn't text anymore. It is a small, trapped whirlwind spinning in the center of the page. Inside the miniature storm, I see flashes of my life: the door to my childhood home, the face of a person I haven't thought of in years, and the career I thought I wanted—now looking like a suit of armor with no one inside it.

*"Question 2: If you achieve everything you have planned, who will be left to tell you the truth?"*

The room begins to grow colder. The fluorescent lights overhead start to hum a melody I recognize from a lullaby I’d long forgotten. I try to pick up my pencil, but it feels heavy, as if it’s made of lead-weighted stone. When I finally manage to touch the tip to the paper, the page doesn't tear. Instead, it ripples like the surface of a dark pond.

The ink from my pen bleeds upward, rising into the air to form a map of a city that doesn't exist yet. I realize then that this isn't a test of what I’ve learned, but a test of what I’m willing to lose. 

The final question appears at the very bottom of the page, glowing with a soft, bioluminescent light:

*"Question 3: Are you the one dreaming, or are you the one being dreamt?"*

I look up to scream for help, but the exam hall has dissolved. The desks are now rows of ancient trees, and the ceiling has opened up to a sky filled with three moons. I realize I don't need a pen to answer. I just need to let go of the desk.

As I let go, I begin to float upward, and the career I was so worried about feels like a small, discarded pebble in the vast ocean of the stars. I close my eyes, and for the first time in the dream, I know exactly what the answer is.

I wake up just as I’m about to say it.
