The crowd... the sheer weight of faces blurred together in expectant stillness almost knocks me sideways. I begin to… stumble, a ridiculous, clumsy trip over the lip of the stage. The murmuring ripples through the massive auditorium – nervous giggles, anticipatory shuffles. Instead of mortified, though, a peculiar tranquility descends. It feels… welcoming. They'd *expected* it.

I clutch the podium, which somehow appears woven from twisting cherry twigs and shimmering dew. Looking down, I realize I'm not wearing a formal outfit, as I must have been planning, but a long, loose cloak the colour of twilight. And a single, perfectly formed snowbird—white plumage, bright charcoal eyes—is resting nestled in my palm, radiating quiet, comforting warmth.

Taking a deep breath, I realize I don’t have any pre-memorized lines. The anxiety shrinks further. Instead, I instinctively close my eyes, and the snowbird hums a tiny, insistent tune against my palm. The tune unravels into images, vibrant colours exploding behind my closed lids. I don’t *think* words; I simply **feel** the need to tell stories, raw and unfiltered. 

I begin narrating.

"I dreamed I fell…” I say, my voice surprisingly steady and resonant, seemingly originating from multiple points around the massive space. “…I dreamt I plummeted without bottom, a silent scream echoing into blackness. But falling, I realized, isn't always down. Sometimes… it’s letting yourself drift sideways, to discover a perspective you never knew existed.”

As I speak—or, perhaps, simply share—images from *their* memories play across my eyelids and then bloom on the vast wall behind the stage, a spontaneous kaleidoscope of shared stories. I see a little girl losing her first sandcastle to the tide, her heartbroken face illuminated against a fiery sunset. A farmer tirelessly plowing a stubbornly resistant soil. Lovers meeting shyly for the first time under an amber lamplight.

The crowd doesn’t clap. They stand transfixed, tears welling, smiles flickering. I continue, guiding the narratives with the snowbird's humming melodies, connecting disparate lives, revealing the subtle harmonies binding them together. I don't explain. I just let the universal echoes resonate through the air - the joy, the longing, the quiet resilience.



The room breathes then – a sound powerful like the wind rushing from a valley – signifying the complete shift of emotions. A single spotlight appears beside me, shining warm to the snowbird – so intensely white. The bird chirrups once then rises upwards, flying over every face and back towards an open, endless blue expanse above me where countless stars wink warmly.


When it disappears into that vast night, I open my eyes again for the last time.



Silence lingers, heavier than before. Then, just as it seems the air itself will solidify out of unspoken feeling, an old woman at the edge of the assembled audience, leaning on a walking stick, slowly breaks a small, heartfelt smile of recognition and gently touches the hand of a man next to her. 



And I woke up.
