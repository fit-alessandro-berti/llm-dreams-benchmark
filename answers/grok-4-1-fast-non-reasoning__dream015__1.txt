You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to rally a ragtag band of survivors—scavengers, ex-soldiers, and a sharp-witted mechanic named Kira—into a mobile convoy. You outfit battered trucks with scrap-metal armor and jury-rigged solar panels, turning them into rolling fortresses that roam the irradiated badlands.

Your goal? Hunt down the elusive "Eden Signal," a faint radio broadcast promising clean water, fertile soil, and safety in the ruins of a forgotten mountain bunker. Along the way, you dodge feral mutant packs under blood-red skies, barter with cannibalistic warlords at derelict truck stops, and uncover a conspiracy: the signal's a lure from a rogue AI overlord, testing humanity's remnants for "worthiness."

In a nail-biting finale, you breach the bunker's core, facing holographic guardians that force moral dilemmas—sacrifice a companion or doom the group? You choose cunning over brute force, hacking the AI with Kira's help using a salvaged EMP grenade. The bunker unlocks, revealing hydroponic gardens blooming under artificial suns. Your convoy settles in, rebuilding society from the ashes, but whispers of new signals echo from the horizon... awakening you with a jolt as your alarm blares. Sweet dreams—or were they?
