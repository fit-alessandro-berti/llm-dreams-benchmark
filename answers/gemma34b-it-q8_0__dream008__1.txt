...immediately started breathing incredibly fast, shallow gasps ripping from my throat like a frantic seagull. The fluorescent light overhead buzzed, seeming suddenly oppressive, and I realized my hands were trembling uncontrollably. The digital display on my computer, normally showcasing innocuous project numbers, exploded in a cascade of neon green code symbols - an infinite loop.

My desk, usually organized with careful precision, began to morph. Files rearranged themselves into towering stacks of origami swans, each one meticulously sculpted and fragile. Every speck of dust danced in the air, whirling into tiny, furious storms of sparkle.  My keyboard typed itself, frantically spewing out nonsensical jargon filled with the words “Temporal Fracture,” “Singular Vector Dispersion," and repeatedly, “Due Diligence - Instantly!” 

I turned, and my boss, Mr. Harrison – a notoriously stooped man usually wrapped entirely in a beige trench coat – was…melting. Not literally, but shifting subtly, like watercolor paint spreading over damp pavement. He wasn’t human anymore. Instead, from his frame emerged a colony of iridescent butterflies, each fluttering a miniature conversation in a shimmering, urgent drone. 

They tilted their tiny iridescent heads at me and, in perfect synchronization, began to spell out a single, impossible command on the newly reformed walls of my cubby: “REWRITE EXISTENCE.”

I stood there, rooted, choked on the humid, electric air of my nightmare office. A single, shimmering butterfly detached from the horde and landed gently on my fingertips. It wasn't menacing, but intensely, painfully aware. As I looked into its multifaceted eye, I knew with dreadful certainty this wasn't a project.  This wasn’t about deliverables. 



…it was about understanding *why* everything had to be immediately, undeniably, perfectly.  And as the butterflies dissolved back into dust, carried off by breezes I alone could feel, I heard a disembodied laugh echo through the office, a dry, brittle sound that whispered: “Don’t worry. You don't need to solve it. Just *accept*.”
