follow them through the crowded streets, weaving in and out of the throngs of people. The city landscape swirls around you—a vivid tapestry of neon lights, vast billboards, and the constant hum of urban life. As you move along, the streets begin to transform. The high-rise buildings melt into a lush, dense forest. The concrete under your feet turns to soft, mossy ground.

The group of strangers now appear as silhouettes against the glowing moonlight filtering through the treetops. The leader, a tall figure with a gentle voice, guides you down a narrow path. The air is fresh, filled with the scent of pine and wildflowers. Despite the darkness of the woods, you feel a strange sense of peace and safety.

You arrive at a clearing where a small lake mirrors the starry sky. The group sits down, and together you all watch the stars reflect in the water’s surface—shimmering like tiny diamonds scattered across a vast, dark velvet cloth. One of the strangers begins to speak about the stars, each constellation telling its own ancient story.

As you listen, the feeling of being lost subsides. Instead, you feel a deep connection to the world around you, to these kind strangers, and to the whispering woods. Despite the initial fears and the unfamiliar surroundings, you realize that sometimes feeling lost is just a part of finding a new path—or perhaps, a way to reconnect with yourself.

As the dream fades and you slowly drift towards awakening, you carry with you a newfound sense of clarity and comfort, knowing that no matter where you are, there is beauty and kindness to be found.
