As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people, each engaged in lively conversations. The room is dimly lit, with flickering candlelight casting long shadows on the walls.  

You weave through the crowd, catching fragments of laughter and whispered secrets. A group of strangers dressed in elaborate masks turns to stare at you, their eyes glinting with curiosity. One of them extends a hand, offering you a glass of shimmering liquid that seems to glow from within.  

Just as you consider taking it, you spot your friend across the room—standing near a grand piano, their face half-hidden in the shifting light. But before you can reach them, the floor beneath you tilts, and suddenly, you're falling—not down, but *sideways*, into a corridor lined with mirrors.  

Each reflection shows a different version of yourself: one laughing, one crying, one wearing a mask just like the strangers. At the end of the hall, your friend waits, but their voice sounds distant, echoing as if underwater.  

Then—you wake up.  

Would you like to explore the dream further, or is this where it ends?
