The noise of the city softens into music, and each stranger offers a small gift—a warm scarf, a lantern, a folded map that rearranges itself with every turn. You pass archways that open into quiet gardens and stairways that spiral up into the night. At a rooftop overlooking the city, they point to a constellation that mirrors the streets below. “You’re here,” they say, and the map in your hands glows gently. You feel a calm spread through you, as if the city itself has become a friend. When you look back, the strangers are gone, but the lantern in your hand still burns, and you wake with the warmth of their kindness lingering in your chest.
