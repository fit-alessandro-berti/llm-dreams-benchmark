…written in a language you somehow know but can’t quite read, the letters wriggling like tadpoles across the page. One question asks you to “draw the sound of your future,” another is just a blank box that smells like rain. You glance around and the other students are already whispering answers into seashells, their desks slowly lifting off the floor. 

Your pen melts into a paintbrush, and as you try to write, the classroom walls dissolve into a wide, blue sky. The examiner, now your childhood teacher wearing a pilot’s hat, tells you there’s only one way to pass: you have to fly. You stand, step onto the paper, and it folds into a paper airplane beneath your feet. 

As you lift off, the questions scatter into a flock of birds, and somewhere below, the exam hall becomes a tiny dot. Just as you think you might land in the right answer, you wake up with the taste of ink on your tongue.
