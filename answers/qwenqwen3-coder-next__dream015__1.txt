…plant a single, improbable seed.

It’s not much—just one smooth, amber-colored seed, tucked into the lining of your worn coat pocket, left over from a long-forgotten pre-Collapse garden. You don’t remember acquiring it. Maybe it was a gift. Maybe it was hope you’d forgotten you were saving.

The ground is cracked and gray beneath your boots, the air thick with ash and silence. In the distance, the skeletal remains of a city claw at a bruised sky. You’ve just evaded a pack of feral hunting dogs, their eyes glowing faintly in the gloom, and now you’re crouched in the lee of a collapsed subway entrance, breathing hard.

You *could* keep moving. Hunt, scavenge, survive another night in the rusted hulk of an old bus. But something in your bones—older than fear, older than logic—whispers: *This is not all there is.*

So you dig.

With chipped fingernails and bleeding knuckles, you hollow out a shallow pit in the one patch of slightly damp, untouched earth you’ve seen in weeks—a forgotten corner where rainwater pools beneath a fractured skylight, shielded from the acid winds. You place the seed carefully in the soil, cover it gently, then—almost without thinking—press your forehead to the ground and speak aloud, though your voice is hoarse with disuse:

> “Grow. Not for me. Not even for survival. Just… grow.”

You don’t wait for rain. You pour out the last third of your water canteen into the soil, then sit back, exhausted, wrapped in a silence so deep it hums.

By dawn—thin, hazy, and tinged with gold—the crack in the earth has widened. And pushing through it, impossibly green, defiantly *alive*, is a single shoot.

It doesn’t look like food. Doesn’t look like medicine.

But it *breathes*.

And in that fragile green thread, trembling in the ash-wind, you realize:  
*We haven’t forgotten how to begin again.*

You stand. You leave the seedling in its sheltered cradle. You don’t dig up its roots for fuel. You don’t eat it. You just… leave it.

Because the world doesn’t need more scavengers tonight.  
It needs witnesses.

And you walk on—not toward survival, but toward *what comes next*.
