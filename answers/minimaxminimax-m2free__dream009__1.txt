You blink, and the world that greets you is a riot of colors that have no name in any modern catalog—vast meadows of amber grass swaying under a sun that hangs lower and brighter than you’ve ever seen, the air thick with the scent of pine sap and fresh earth. There are no steel towers, no humming power lines, only the ancient silhouette of a ruined stone chapel half‑covered in ivy, its broken archways framing the sky like an unclosed book.

As you step onto the soft ground, the feel of worn, sun‑warmed stones under your boots reminds you that you have no digital map, no GPS to guide you. The only sounds are a distant river babbling over smooth rocks, the occasional chirp of unfamiliar birds, and the soft rustle of insects in the high grass. You realize that, in this strange epoch, you need to **find a safe place to rest, a source of clean water, and a way to nourish yourself before night falls**.

You spot a glint of silver to the east—a narrow path winding through a grove of twisted oaks. Following it, you come upon a natural clearing, a shallow creek looping like a silver ribbon around a low, moss‑covered hill. The water is crystal clear, reflecting the amber sky, and you hear the gentle splash of a family of small, bright‑scaled fish darting between reeds.

Beside the creek, an ancient stone well—its walls thick with ivy—still holds a faint trickle of water. You cup your hands, feeling the cool liquid slide over your fingers, and drink deeply. It’s pure, reviving.

Now you turn your attention to food. The forest floor is carpeted with clusters of wild berries—some ruby red, some deep purple—sprinkled among the roots of ferns. A flock of curious, glossy‑black birds perch on a nearby oak, their bright eyes watching you. You recall a fragment of knowledge: birds often roost near fruit-bearing trees. You reach for the berries, tasting each one cautiously; the sweetness bursts on your tongue, confirming they’re edible.

Beyond the clearing, the broken chapel’s nave is partially intact, offering a roof of stone and a corner where a heap of dry leaves has gathered. You gather the leaves, arranging them into a makeshift bed, then haul a few sturdy branches to reinforce the makeshift shelter against the wind that begins to pick up as the sun dips toward the horizon.

A fire will be essential. Near the riverbank, you notice fallen branches, dry bark, and a few flinty stones. You strike two stones together, coaxing sparks that catch the dry tinder. A small flame blooms, casting a warm glow that pushes back the encroaching dusk. You place a few damp leaves over the fire to create a thin veil of smoke—a traditional signal to keep predators at bay and a reminder that you are not entirely alone.

As night settles, the sky opens up into a canvas of stars—none of the city‑light‑polluted constellations you know, but new patterns that seem to pulse with ancient stories. The crackle of the fire, the murmur of the creek, and the distant hoot of an owl create a lullaby that both soothes and reminds you of the precariousness of your situation.

You lie down on your leaf‑softened bed, eyes drifting closed as the dream‑like certainty of this place wraps around you. In this moment, the need to survive becomes a simple rhythm: breathe, sip the creek’s water, nibble the berries, keep the fire alive, and listen for the subtle cues of the world around you. And in that rhythm, you find a strange peace—a promise that, even without the trappings of modern technology, the basics of life can be reclaimed with patience, observation, and a dash of wonder.

The dream deepens, and you drift into a sleep where the boundaries of time blur, and the whisper of the ancient woods tells you that perhaps the journey itself is the answer to what you need.
