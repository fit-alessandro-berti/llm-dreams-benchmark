You feel a storm approaching and the wind lifts the leaves around you like a whispering crowd. Dark clouds gather in a heartbeat, but instead of rain, soft glowing droplets begin to fall, each one lighting a patch of moss. You follow the lights deeper into the trees until you find a small clearing with a mirror‑still pond. As thunder rolls softly in the distance, the water ripples and reflects a sky that isn’t yours—one full of constellations you don’t recognize. You step closer, and the reflection reaches back.
