…not printed in ink at all. They are stitched into the paper in a pale blue thread that shimmers when you tilt it, the way fish scales flash between reeds. Every time you blink, the sentences loosen and retie themselves. The instructions at the top read: Do not begin until told, but told is crossed out and replaced with ready, which seems kind but not actually easier.

The fluorescent lights hum as if they have swallowed bees. The other students around you are hunched, already writing, though you’re certain no one said to start. Their pencils move as if they are carving lines into water. The proctor at the front is someone you almost recognize—your high school chemistry teacher wearing your grandmother’s cardigan, a university crest stitched over her heart like a patch to keep it from leaking. She is staring out the window at nothing visible.

You lower your eyes to the first question. It reads:

1. Explain, in your own words, why the window you opened that one summer never closed properly again.

You remember the tilt of that window, the way it always let a small line of weather in. You remember your father saying, We will fix it on the weekend, and how the weekend became a lake you never reached. You write: Because air wants to be where we are. Because some hinges have promises rusted into them. Your pencil dulls quickly against the softness of the page. The letters do not stay. They lift as you write, float like moths, and settle on your wrist.

2. Define “calling.” Show your work.

You write definitions as if they were a spell. You bring them up from the bottom of your throat: bird, bell, someone saying your name from another room. You scratch arrows between a job and the feeling that pulls at your ribs at 3 a.m. You draw an ear. You draw the sea cupped inside it.

3. Using the tools provided, find north.

You look down. Your pencil is a twig. The eraser is an old gumdrop. Your ruler is a lick of sunlight. You place the sunlight on the desk and watch where the shadow edges sharpen. When you turn the page, a small compass rose has appeared faintly in the margin, as if burned by a patient finger.

Around you the room is warming, or you are. The test continues:

4. Calculate how many years you have lost to being almost ready.

You begin, then stop. The numbers on your hand become birds and fly up to the ceiling where the smoke detector blinks a green eye.

You laugh, and the proctor looks at you sharply and then smiles, the way a photograph used to be developed, a face arriving from whiteness. Keep going, her smile says without moving.

The next question is a drawing of three doors. Each door is labeled with a verb: stay, climb, surrender. The space under the drawing says: Choose one and justify your choice in ten lines or fewer. You do not feel like ten lines is enough and also it is too much. You tap the "climb" door with your pencil and it opens a fraction, releasing mountain air that smells like iron and thyme. You tap "stay" and a pot of soup burbles somewhere beyond it, the light a warm amber. You hover over "surrender." The paper cools under your hand. There is the sound of a lake easing itself back into its own borders. You circle the white space between the doors and write beside it: Sometimes it is none of these. Sometimes the door is a window and you go through like wind.

Your neighbor’s paper rustles and you glance over, expecting formulas, finding instead a map of your childhood neighborhood, each house labeled with the names of people who had dogs that loved you. A small, precise writing in red says: There will be no partial credit for closed hearts.

You shake your head, and it makes a sound like marbles settling in a glass bowl. The overhead clock counts in sycamore leaves. The minute hand creeps and sheds a papery skin every time it moves. The proctor coughs and a moth drifts out of her sleeve. It lands on your test and becomes a period, firm and final at the end of a sentence you didn’t write.

Halfway down the next page is a smear you recognize as a memory. When you touch it with your fingertip, it opens into a little film. You watch yourself in your first apartment, the one with the sink that sounded like a train when it drained. You are making ramen at midnight. You are making plans you say out loud into the steam so they will hear you and know to come. The question beneath the film reads:

5. In what tense do you dream of yourself? Conjugate accordingly.

You are about to write I will be, I will be, as a chant, as a promise, when the lights flicker. The room blurs. Your desk floats a handsbreadth off the floor and you tilt your knees to stabilize it as if you are at sea. You have never been good on boats, but here you are, answering sea-questions with land-words.

There are equations too, because there always are. A long ladder of symbols, and you recognize in them the shape of the human spine. Each vertebra is an unknown. Each unknown is a decision you made in a coffee shop with bad lighting. Solve for courage, it says, and show your substitutes.

On the next page, the numerous short answer is actually short: Your name. It requests it in a box wreathed with laurels you have not yet earned. You print your name carefully, but the letters arrive out of order. You rearrange them like chairs before a concert. Your name becomes a verb. Your name becomes a place. Your name becomes a small bird and perches on the upper right-hand corner of the paper, tilting its head with a concern that undoes you.

You reach the essay portion and it’s not a question but a mirror. The instruction is gentle and impossible: Tell us about a time you were the person you were most afraid to be. You want to write about the interview you fled, the apartment you left, the apology you swallowed. Instead you write about a morning you woke before your alarm and felt the shape of the day like a key under your pillow. You write about how you didn’t yet know what it opened, but you carried it anyway. As your pencil moves, the paper warms, like you are ironing out a wrinkled shirt that someone important might see you in.

The proctor walks by. Up close, you see that the crest on her cardigan is not a crest at all but a little backyard gate, latched. She pauses, places a stick of chalk in the crook of your elbow as if tucking something under your wing. Just in case, she says quietly, and moves on. Her shoes make the soft sound that snow makes when it decides to begin.

You are losing track of the number of questions. They have stopped being numbered and started being moments. At the bottom of a page: Circle all the rooms in which you have taught yourself to be kind. You circle your mouth, your spine, the space behind your knees where fear tends to hide. The paper sighs.

Then there is a final page, but it is not the end. It asks for a signature acknowledging that you understand the consequences: that a choice is a door you keep opening, that a career is a weather system you learn to move within, that you will sometimes be rained on. It asks if you accept uncertainty as a colleague. It asks if you will return your borrowed clocks.

You realize you have been holding your breath. The breath is heavy. You set it down on the page like a candlestick.

Somewhere a bell rings, not loudly, like a porcelain cup tapped with a ring. The other students begin to put their pencils aside. Some of them are your younger selves, gangly and certain. Some are versions of you in clothes you haven’t owned yet, smelling faintly of toner and libraries and oranges. The proctor says, Time, but the word stretches and wraps and becomes tide. Papers lift in a wind that has no source, flap, settle.

You look down at what you’ve done. There are gaps where you thought you should have answers. There are drawings that look like bridges and shoulders and kitchens. There is a place where you pressed so hard with the pencil the page nearly tore. Through that fissure you can see the floor, gleaming like a calm lake. You are ashamed for a moment and then you aren’t, because a small thing has happened: the bird with your name in its breast hops across to the torn place and pecks at it until it is a window.

You do not think, because thinking has led you in so many circles that have beautiful views and no exits. You slide your fingers under the paper door you have drawn and step your gaze through. On the other side is not a single hallway but a series of lawns run through with paths made of different materials: brick, gravel, late sun. People are walking. Some are standing in the shade of a tree, arguing gently about the best way to measure a life. A child is kneeling, determined, trying to make a dam in a rivulet with a line of carefully placed leaves.

The proctor comes to your desk to collect your exam. You hold it out like an offering. It feels warm and a little alive. Her hand closes over yours, one pulse meeting another, and for a second you think of all the exams you have taken and the way you have always wanted someone to tell you where to put your fear. She does not take the paper. She looks at it and then at you, and in her eyes you see the exact weather of the day you were born—a hard rain passing, sun laid down like a knife on the sidewalk.

It is all right, she says, and her voice is the sound of currants dropping into dough. You can finish on your way.

And because this is a dream and also not a dream, because you are tired of sitting still for a future that refuses to come when called, you stand. Your chair makes a soft bird-whistle against the floor. You tuck the paper under your arm, where it becomes a map you don’t have to read to follow. You walk to the door, which is not marked exit but begin, and you step through into the weather, which is yours, which has been waiting, which asks its own questions and allows you to answer by moving.
