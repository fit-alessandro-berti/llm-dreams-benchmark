...the air grows thick and heavy, tasting of ozone and damp earth. The gentle rustling of leaves transforms into a frantic, whispered conversation, and the canopy above sways as if bowing to an unseen force.

You look up. The sky, once a clear, hopeful blue, is now a bruised purple-grey. Clouds boil across the sun, swallowing the light with alarming speed.

Then, the first drops of rain fall. They are not soft or timid; they are heavy, cold, and deliberate, striking your skin like tiny, icy pinpricks. A low, visceral rumble echoes through the ground, vibrating up through the soles of your feet.

You know you need to find shelter. You scan the ancient, gnarled trees, their bark dark and slick with rain, and that’s when you see it: nestled in the hollow of a colossal, weeping willow is a small, round door made of polished oak, with a brass handle shaped like a fern frond. It shouldn't be there. It never was before. But the storm is growing, the wind now howling through the branches, and the rain is a solid, silver curtain.

With a sense of urgency, you push aside the weeping willow's trailing leaves—which seem to part for you—and grasp the cold brass handle. You turn it, and the door swings open silently, revealing not the inside of a tree, but a warm, circular room filled with the scent of burning cedar and old paper.

You step inside just as the sky rips open and the full fury of the storm is unleashed. The door clicks shut behind you, muffling the tempest's roar to a distant, comforting hum. You are in a library, but not a normal one. Books with glowing spines line the curved walls from floor to ceiling, and a fire crackles merrily in a hearth that has no chimney. In the center of the room, on a plush velvet armchair, sits a woman with silver hair braided with living ivy. She doesn't look surprised to see you.

She smiles, her eyes twinkling like distant galaxies. "Ah," she says, her voice the sound of pages turning. "You've arrived just in time. The storm always brings the most interesting readers. Come, dry yourself by the fire. There is a story here you've been looking for."

And as you move closer, you realize all the books are titled with your name, but in languages you've never seen before.
