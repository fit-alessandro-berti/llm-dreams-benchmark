Okay, this is really getting to me!

You wake up in a completely different Era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your newfound surroundings – a sun-baked valley filled with the scent of sagebrush, ancient grey sandstone cliffs rising on all four sides, and the bleating of livestock far off to the south – you realize you need to **find clear clean water before the sun fully sets.**

That initial sense of panic is quickly overridden by a primal urgency. My skin glistens with sweat, coated in dust. My throat feels instantly parched, and my stomach is already constricting tight.  Beyond the desperation, I begin observing carefully. There's a small stream meandering through a bend in the cliffs, its bed piled with rounded stones. Judging by the stunted vegetation around it - patchy shrubs and tenacious wildflowers clinging to the base - it seems like the most likely possibility, but a wary feeling tells me it might be contaminated.  I spot what looks like a rudimentary well near these cliffs - probably handcrafted with stone – and that feels like a safer, slightly wiser bet than the stream, although accessing it means scrambling over a particularly steep and sun-sweated scree pile. 


Do you want me to continue in a particular direction? Maybe you want me to focus on the people around, the strange customs, or are keen for me to just keep exploring?
