The city is alive with strange sounds—whispers in languages you don’t recognize, the distant echo of a clock striking a time that doesn’t exist, and the soft hum of glowing lanterns that flicker like fireflies in the twilight. Buildings stretch impossibly high, their facades shifting as you pass, as if the city itself is watching you.
