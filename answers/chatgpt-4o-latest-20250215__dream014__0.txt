gladly accept their offer. They guide you through winding alleyways illuminated by neon lights, the hum of distant music filling the air. As you walk, the city begins to transform—the buildings stretch taller, their windows glowing like stars, and the streets become soft beneath your feet, as if woven from clouds.

One of the strangers, a woman with shimmering silver eyes, hands you a small, golden compass. “This will show you the way,” she says with a knowing smile. But as you glance down at the compass, the needle spins wildly, pointing in all directions at once. 

The others laugh gently. “It doesn’t point to a place,” another stranger explains, “but to what you seek most.” 

You close your eyes, focusing on your deepest longing. When you open them again, the city has melted into a vast, endless ocean, reflecting the constellations above. A small boat waits for you at the water’s edge, the same strangers standing beside it, their faces now familiar, like old friends.

“You’re not lost,” the silver-eyed woman whispers. “You were always meant to find this.”

As you step into the boat, a warm breeze carries you forward, and the city fades into memory. The compass in your hand finally stops spinning, pointing straight ahead. You follow its direction, feeling, for the first time in a long while, that you are exactly where you’re supposed to be.
