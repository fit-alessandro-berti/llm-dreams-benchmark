You begin to speak, your voice steady despite the nerves. As you share your thoughts, you notice the audience is not just listening—they’re *listening* in a way you’ve never experienced before. Each word feels heavier, more alive, as if the room itself is holding its breath. Suddenly, a child in the front row raises their hand, not to ask a question, but to point to a symbol on the wall—a flickering light that had been there all along. You realize the speech wasn’t just about your words; it was about *seeing* the unseen. The crowd begins to murmur, not with applause, but with a quiet, collective understanding. When you finish, you don’t feel the usual rush of relief. Instead, you feel a strange calm, as though the dream has left a mark on you, a reminder that sometimes, the most powerful speeches aren’t about what you say, but what you *uncover* while saying it.
