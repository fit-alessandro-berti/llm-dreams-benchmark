**Dream Continuation**:

As you weave through the crowd, your outstretched hand grazes a floating lantern suspended midair. It pulses with a soft, bioluminescent glow, casting wavering shadows on the faces around you. A group nearby bursts into laughter, their voices syncing into a harmonic chant that resonates through the floorboards. You pause, drawn to a woman in a dress stitched from what looks like pressed autumn leaves. She smiles, offering a crystal goblet filled with liquid that shifts colors like a prism. “For the seeker,” she murmurs, her eyes reflecting constellations. You drink, and the taste is nostalgia—warm apple cider mixed with ocean spray.

Suddenly, the room pivots. The walls dissolve into a starry expanse, revealing the gathering is aboard a colossal ship adrift in a cosmic sea. Groups around you morph: a circle of clockwork birds debate philosophy, their gears whirring in time with a distant hum; a cluster of shadowy figures dances atop a pool of liquid light, their forms rippling like ink. You spot a mirror across the deck and approach, but as you near, your reflection steps out, wearing your face but speaking in a voice like wind chimes. “They’re here,” it says, pointing to the ship’s prow.

You follow, passing through a curtain of hanging vines that brush your skin like curious fingers. Beyond lies a garden suspended in zero gravity, flowers blooming upside-down. There, amidst petals that hum lullabies, sits your acquaintance—but now they’re surrounded by a constellation of floating orbs, each projecting memories you’d forgotten. They turn, smiling, and the orbs coallesce into a bridge of light leading to a door framed by twisting vines. “Finally,” they say, extending a hand. “The party’s just begun.”

Behind them, the cosmic ocean roils, and the ship’s hull shudders as something immense surfaces below.
