...you feel a storm approaching and the gentle breeze morphs into a furious gale, whipping your hair across your face and tearing leaves from the branches above. The rustling of leaves becomes a roar, punctuated by the distant, ominous rumble of thunder.

The sky, moments ago a soft blue dappled with sunlight filtering through the canopy, turns a bruised, angry purple-black. The light drains from the forest, plunging you into a disorienting twilight. Fat, cold raindrops begin to splatter against your skin, quickly escalating into a torrential downpour. Each drop feels like an icy pellet.

Your heart pounds in your chest. You need to find shelter, and fast. You scan wildly, searching for any kind of refuge – a thicket, an overhang, a hollow tree. Through a flash of lightning that splits the sky and illuminates the forest in stark, skeletal detail, you see it. Not a cave, exactly, but an opening at the base of an ancient, gnarled oak, its roots like grasping talons. It seems to pulse with a faint, inviting light.

Drawn by an irresistible pull, you stumble towards it, rain now lashing down, soaking you to the bone. You squeeze through the opening, pushing aside damp moss and clinging vines, and find yourself not in a dark, damp hollow, but somewhere else entirely.

The air here is warm, still, and smells of dried herbs and old parchment. Before you is a vast, circular library, shelves stretching up into an impossibly high, domed ceiling. Soft light emanates from glowing orbs floating amongst the books. An old figure, cloaked and hooded, sits at a large wooden desk in the center, seemingly undisturbed by the raging storm you can still faintly hear outside, like a distant memory.

They look up, their eyes twinkling with an ancient amusement. "You took your time," they say, their voice like rustling pages. "The book you're looking for is on the third shelf, to the left."

You don't know what book they mean, but you feel a sudden, intense desire to find it. As you turn towards the shelves, the scent of rain and forest floor begins to fade, replaced by the faint smell of your own pillow... and you know the storm, and the library, are receding as you begin to wake up.
