…each challenge seems to mirror a part of your own life, though in strange, dreamlike ways. The first one takes place in a vast library, where the books are alive — whispering, shifting on the shelves as you search for a single glowing volume that contains your childhood inspiration. Each time you pull out a book, the words inside swirl into clouds that form scenes from your past, testing your memory and your ability to interpret their meaning.

The second challenge shifts instantly — the library walls dissolve into a wide-open desert under a swirling purple sky. Here, you must navigate a series of shimmering mirages that offer comfort or temptation, but only one path leads toward your goal. Your own doubts take shape as shadowy figures that offer easier routes… but accepting them would mean giving up the truth of what you want.

By the third challenge, the ground beneath you becomes water, calm but deep, and you’re told to "find your voice." You dive in, and beneath the surface, you hear echoes of all the advice, encouragement, and criticism you’ve ever received. To move forward, you must speak — but not just any words. The phrase that opens the way forward is something only your heart knows, a truth you haven’t admitted aloud before.

When you finally emerge, soaked but unafraid, you stand before a great golden door. Behind it lies the final test: not a trial of skill, but of choice. You can take your dream job now… or step away to help another competitor who has fallen behind. You know that helping them means risking your own win — perhaps losing it entirely — but as you stand there, you feel the weight of what this says about the kind of person you are.

You take a deep breath.

What do you choose?

I can continue the dream in two different directions depending on your choice — would you like me to explore the path where you **take the job** or where you **help the other competitor**?
