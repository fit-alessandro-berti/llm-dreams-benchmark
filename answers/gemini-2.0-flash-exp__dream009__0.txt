Okay, the dream is swirling around me… I can feel the soft pressure of the bed, though it’s strangely… rougher.

I wake up with a jolt, a faint scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filling my nostrils. Gone are the familiar sounds of the city; replaced with the chirping of birds I don’t recognize and a low hum of insects. I sit up, blinking, and take in the scene.

This isn’t my bedroom. The walls are made of rough-hewn logs, chinked with mud. A single shaft of sunlight pierces through a gap in the roof, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. My pajamas are gone, replaced by what feels like coarse linen trousers and a simple tunic. There's a heavy, wooden chair in the corner, and a small, roughly-carved table near what looks like a hearth.  No phone, no clock, no glowing screen of any kind. It's like stepping back in time.

A wave of disorientation washes over me, followed by a strange, exhilarating fear. I stumble out of the building (a small hut, I now realize) and into a clearing. A few similar structures dot the landscape, and a winding path leads towards what looks like a small village.  People are moving about, dressed similarly to me, some tending to small plots of land, others carrying baskets or tools. There's a rhythmic thudding sound – probably someone working on wood. 

This is… unbelievable.  I'm not in my time, not even close. There’s a sense of a world untouched by modern conveniences. No cars, no electricity, no internet – just raw, unfiltered nature and a community that seems to live in harmony with it.  

But this dream is vivid, almost too real. I need… I need to survive, yes, that's it. I can't just wander around aimlessly. If I’m stuck here, in this time, then **I need to find a way to understand the local customs, and more importantly, find food and water.** My stomach growls, a stark reminder of my basic human needs.  The thought of being out here without any understanding of how they live makes me realize I need more than just food, I need to **learn how this society functions to avoid causing trouble**.

So, my dream-self decides, that's my immediate goal.  I'll start by observing the villagers. I need to figure out their routines, learn their language (if they even speak anything I can understand), and hopefully, find someone who might be willing to help me. I’m going to have to be quick-witted, adaptable, and most importantly, try to blend in and not be noticed, too much anyway.  Because, deep down, I have a feeling that being different in this world could be very dangerous.
