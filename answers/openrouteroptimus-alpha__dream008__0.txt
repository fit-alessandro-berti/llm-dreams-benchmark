...feel your hands trembling as you try to log in to your computer, but the keyboard keys keep rearranging themselves, becoming gibberish symbols you can’t recognize. The office lights flicker, and everyone around you is typing at impossible speeds, papers flying, printers whirring, but whenever you look at your own screen, the document stubbornly remains blank.

Your boss stands behind you, impatient. The clock on the wall spins its hands so fast it blurs into a single silver circle. You open your mouth to ask for an extension, but your voice comes out as a cloud of bubbles, floating up to the ceiling.

Suddenly, your phone rings, the ringtone echoing louder and louder, until it drowns out everything else. When you answer it, your own voice says: “Wake up. It’s due now.” The computer dissolves into mist beneath your hands and you realize you’re not sitting, but floating, weightless, papers drifting all around like snow.
