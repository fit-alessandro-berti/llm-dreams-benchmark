venture out to the old library, hoping to find books that might guide you through this new world. The library is a massive, crumbling structure, overgrown with ivy and vines. As you approach, you notice a faint, eerie glow coming from within. You push open the heavy wooden doors, creaking ominously, and step inside.

The inside of the library is dimly lit, the air filled with dust and the scent of old paper. The silence is deafening, broken only by the distant echo of your footsteps. You make your way through the rows of bookshelves, their spines covered in thick layers of dust.

Suddenly, you hear a low growl behind you. You spin around to see a large, snarling dog. It's not like any dog you've seen before - its fur is matted and dirty, and its eyes are wild and feral. You're not sure if it's a stray or something more sinister.

You have three options:

1. Try to calm the dog by slowly approaching it and speaking softly.
2. Grab a nearby book and use it as a makeshift weapon to defend yourself.
3. Try to run as fast as you can, hoping to lose the dog in the vast library.

What do you choose to do?
