—mirrors of your own insecurities. One day it's an obstacle course of deadlines, giant clocks swinging like pendulums that you have to duck under while carrying stacks of papers that keep turning into birds. The next, you're standing in front of an audience with no faces, trying to give a presentation, but all that comes out of your mouth are bubbles. The host, who looks suspiciously like your eighth‑grade teacher in a sequined blazer, grins and tells you, "Time management!" over the roar of applause and the heartbeat in your ears.

Between rounds the set changes without anyone moving. The fluorescent lights of the studio dissolve into a library lit by candles. Your fellow contestants flicker in and out of existence, sometimes becoming friends, sometimes rivals, sometimes shadows. When you look down, your shoes have turned into wheels, and you glide effortlessly across a floor covered in old résumés that whisper as you pass.

There’s a challenge where you must climb a ladder to an office in the clouds. Each rung is a word from your own CV. You hesitate on "improvise," but when you step on it, it holds. Up top, the "boss" awaiting you is yourself, dressed in the suit you always thought you should wear. They ask you why you want the job, but when you open your mouth this time, your own voice comes out, clear and steady.

Later, in a round called "Collaboration," you're given a box of mismatched puzzle pieces and told to build something with a stranger whose face keeps changing—sometimes it's your best friend, sometimes it's someone you've never met. You laugh as you both instinctively make a bridge, only to realize that the pieces fit together in a way you didn't expect, forming a path over a yawning gap filled with fog.

There are moments of doubt—doors that won't open, a maze of cubicles that rearrange themselves as soon as you think you've found the exit. You feel the panic rise, but then you notice a window. On the other side is a version of you painting a wall with a brush that seems to drip light. You tap the glass, and dream‑you looks back and nods. You remember why you wanted this in the first place.

At the final challenge, the host hands you a blank card. "This is the last test," they say. Around you, the set is silent. You look down at the card; it reflects the faint outline of your face. The instructions: "Do nothing for one minute."

You stand there, utterly still. No proving, no performing, no pretending. The other contestants murmur, the audience leans forward, the clock on the wall melts like wax. Sixty heartbeats pass. In the quiet, something settles.

A bell rings, but it sounds like your alarm. The host, the studio, the fog of the maze—everything blurs and dissolves into morning light. You wake up, the echo of applause fading. On your nightstand lies your real résumé, and next to it, the job application you were too afraid to submit. You smile, feeling oddly as if you’ve already passed the hardest round.
