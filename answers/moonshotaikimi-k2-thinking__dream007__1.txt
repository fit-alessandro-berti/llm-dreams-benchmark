You decide to grab the argument itself—the words hanging in the air between you, tangible as smoke. You ball them up in your fists, feeling their weight, their heat. When you open your hands, the words have become two small stones, one black, one white.

Your friend snatches the white stone, but it burns their palm and they drop it. It shatters on the floor, and each fragment becomes a photograph of a moment you shared—laughing in a car, crying at a kitchen table, falling asleep on a couch. The black stone in your hand pulses with your heartbeat.

You try to speak but your voice comes out as water, pooling at your feet. The room tilts. The photographs begin to flutter like moths, circling the two of you. Your friend reaches out to catch one, but their hand passes through it, and they start crying tears that turn to glass before they hit the floor.

The argument—whatever it was about, you can no longer remember the words—feels suddenly like a door you've both been pushing against. You realize you've been on the same side of it all along, trying to keep something out. Or in.

You place the black stone on the floor. It grows into a small tree whose leaves whisper with their voice and yours, but softer. You both sit beneath it, exhausted, as the photographs settle into its branches like strange fruit. The tree keeps growing until its roots crack the foundation and the room dissolves into starlight.

You wake up with your hand still clenched around nothing, the echo of their voice in your ear, and the certainty that you need to call them.
