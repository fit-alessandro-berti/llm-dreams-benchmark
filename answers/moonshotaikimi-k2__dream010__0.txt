—and the arena itself kept shifting shape like the lobby of a half-remembered hotel.

First they tested endurance. I had to sit in front of an endless stream of bug tickets, each ticket morphing into [a duplicate of itself the moment I closed it](https://xkcd.com/1014/). I started scripting solutions, only to realize the code editor was resisting me: every line I wrote dissolved into CSS padding statements. A judge walked by carrying a rubber duck; it quacked “printf-debugging only” and moved on. I remembered that in dreams, fluency is a currency, so I told the editor, “This is padding only if we both believe it is.” The line finally compiled.

Next came autonomy. They seated me at a table in an open office, handed me a specification written in disappearing ink, and said, “Ship a feature no one asked for by sunset while the requirements remain legible.” Co-workers drifted past like Maurice Sendak monsters wearing noise-canceling headphones. Time dilated strangely; every commit I pushed aged the repo by a year. Branches grew tree rings. I noticed that one monster wore a lanyard labeled “Past Me,” and he was writing the unit tests I hadn’t invented yet. I pair-programmed with him without speaking—our shared muscle memory did the talking—and the feature released itself like a sigh: the software shipped but vanished from the diff history, proving it had been perfect in the first place.

The third round felt like collaboration. We were told to “merge conscious states into a single pull request.” My competitors’ avatars coalesced into a Git graph made of soap bubbles. When mine joined, the bubbles burst into memory-smell: a server room scented with grapefruit and ozone from my first internship. Fragments of conversation floated upward—mentors, flamewars, laughter—then recombined into a functional chat bot that spoke entirely in inside jokes. The judges shrugged: “Your consensus diff has zero conflicts. That qualifies as cosmic harmony.” We all received QR code tattoos on our wrists that 404-ed in different philosophical ways.

Finally, an elevator shaped like a subway car carried the five finalists to the “personal values” floor. The doors opened onto a long hallway where our resumes had been wallpapered in vertical strips above a valley of shredded water-cooler gossip. The instruction was simply: “Find the three sentences that are still breathing and recite them aloud without sounding rehearsed.”

I walked the hall until a breeze fluttered a single bullet point:  
– *Refactored the empathy module into a plugin architecture so that kindness could be updated at runtime.*

It glowed faintly. I touched it and heard the voices of every teammate who had ever thanked me for a code review. Behind me, another finalist began reciting her lit-up sentence in binary; her voice sounded like rain on asphalt.

When I spoke, the hallway folded itself into an origami offer letter. The paper unfolded into a desk overlooking a garden where variables bloomed like chrysanthemums. The rubber duck awaited as my new onboarding buddy. Its bill opened not with a quack but with one perfect question:

“What problem do you wake up wanting to solve, now that debugging waking life is finally your full-time job?”

The dream ended before I could answer, but the question printed itself as a translucent overlay above my morning coffee—quiet, persistent, and without any disappearing ink.
