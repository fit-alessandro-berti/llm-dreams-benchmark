You feel a storm approaching and the air grows heavy with an electric charge. The once-crisp scent of pine is replaced by the metallic tang of impending rain. Suddenly, the sky darkens to an inky violet, and the first drops of rain pierce the silence, drumming on the leaves. But this is no ordinary storm—each drop seems to shimmer faintly, as if infused with liquid light.  

The trees around you begin to whisper, their voices a chorus of rustling secrets. A gust of wind snatches your scarf, pulling you forward into a clearing where the storm’s heart beats. There, standing beneath a skeletal oak, is a figure cloaked in storm clouds, their face obscured by lightning. They hold out a hand, and the rain slows, suspended in midair like a thousand glass beads.  

“You’re late,” the figure says, their voice echoing with the rumble of thunder. “The forest has been waiting.”  

Before you can respond, the ground beneath your feet shifts, revealing a labyrinth of glowing roots winding downward into the earth. The storm’s energy pulses around you, and you realize the choice is yours: follow the path into the unknown, or turn back to the safety of the fading forest. The air hums with possibility, and your heartbeat syncs with the storm’s rhythm. What do you do?
