feel a strange sensation wash over you. The moment your foot touches the stage, the ground beneath you starts to shimmer like liquid silver. The crowd's faces blur together, their eyes glowing faintly with an otherworldly light. You open your mouth to speak, but instead of words, soft music begins to play—emanating from somewhere deep within you.

The air thickens, and suddenly, you're no longer on a stage. You're standing in the middle of a vast forest bathed in twilight hues, the trees towering above you like ancient sentinels. Each note of the music seems to awaken something around you: flowers blooming in impossible colors, streams flowing upward into the sky, and tiny creatures made of starlight dancing at your feet.

You realize that every thought you have becomes reality here. If you think of flying, wings sprout from your back. If you imagine warmth, the sun dips closer, bathing everything in golden light. But as you marvel at this newfound power, you notice shadows creeping along the edges of the dream. They twist and writhe, forming shapes that resemble people you know—or versions of them that feel... wrong.

One shadow steps forward, its form shifting between familiar faces. It speaks without speaking, its voice echoing directly in your mind: *"Do you truly understand what it means to create? To lead?"* 

Before you can respond, the scene shifts again. Now you're floating above a city, watching as it grows and changes according to your emotions. Joy makes the buildings bloom like gardens; doubt causes cracks to spread across the streets. The weight of responsibility presses down on you, yet there’s also exhilaration—a sense of limitless potential.

And then, just as suddenly as it began, the dream starts to fade. The vibrant world dissolves into mist, and you find yourself back on the stage, the expectant faces of the audience still waiting for your first word. Your heart pounds in your chest, but now you feel different—charged with energy, as if part of the dream remains alive inside you.

You take a deep breath, smile, and begin to speak.
