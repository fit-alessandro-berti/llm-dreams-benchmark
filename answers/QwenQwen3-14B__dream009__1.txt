You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find a way to communicate with the locals**—their language is a melodic blend of unfamiliar sounds, and their clothing, woven from coarse fabrics, hints at a society far removed from your own. A bell tolls in the distance, echoing through cobblestone streets littered with horse-drawn carriages and merchants hawking goods in stalls. Your modern clothes draw curious glances, and a child points at you, whispering to their parent.  

Panicked, you clutch your pockets, only to find them empty—your phone, wallet, and keys are gone. The air smells of woodsmoke and baked bread, but your stomach growls. You need to **secure food and shelter** before nightfall, but how do you explain your presence without arousing suspicion? A poster on a nearby wall advertises a "Wanted" notice for a man with your description, though the name is scratched out.  

As you wander, you notice a blacksmith’s forge glowing with embers and a apothecary’s shop brimming with herbs and odd vials. Maybe survival here requires **learning their customs**—bartering with coins you don’t have, or using your knowledge of science and history to your advantage. But as the sun dips lower, casting long shadows, you realize the true challenge: **figuring out how to return home** before this world’s secrets consume you entirely.  

What will you do first?
