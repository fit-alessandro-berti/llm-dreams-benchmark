**complete the dream...**

You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panic, your heartbeat syncing with the flicker of neon signs overhead. The streets are a labyrinth of towering glass buildings that twist into the sky like spiraled candies, their reflections warping the faces of strangers who hurry past, none of them meeting your gaze. You pull out your phone, but the screen glitches—maps apps dissolve into static, clocks spin backward, and your calendar reads *“404: Location Not Found.”*  

You sprint down an alleyway, your footsteps echoing in triple time, as if the city itself is mocking you. The air smells of burnt toast and ozone. A billboard looms overhead, flashing *"YOU’RE LATE"* in crimson letters before dissolving into a flock of paper cranes that scatter into the wind. You follow them, weaving through crowds of faceless figures in suits, their briefcases leaking ink that pools into puddles of liquid shadow.  

A clock tower chimes in the distance—*eight rings, then nine, then none at all*. Time is unraveling. You claw at your coat pockets, finding a crumpled invitation: *"The Room of Mirrors, Floor 13.5, arrive before the clock eats itself."* You’ve never seen it before, but the words feel like a memory you’ve forgotten.  

You stumble into a subway station where the trains are made of light and whispers. The conductor, a woman with one blue eye and one made of smoldering coal, hands you a ticket scribbled with *"FOLLOW THE ECHOES."* The train hurtles through tunnels lined with mirrors, each reflection showing a different version of you—older, younger, screaming, laughing, dissolving. When the doors snap open, you’re in a cavernous library, books floating like fireflies. A tome labeled *"UNLIVED LIVES"* slams open in front of you, its pages riffled by a wind that smells like your grandmother’s perfume.  

“You’re looking for the meeting,” says a voice. The woman from the subway stands there, now wearing a coat stitched from starlight. “But the Room of Mirrors isn’t a place. It’s a question.” She tilts her head. “What are you running from?”  

The floor turns to liquid mercury. You fall, but land softly in a hallway of shattered glass. Each shard reflects a moment you’ve buried: a childhood fear, a lie you told, a door you never opened. At the end of the hall, a door glows gold. You turn the knob, and inside is a version of yourself you’ve never met—calm, smiling, holding a stopwatch that ticks in reverse.  

“You’re here,” they say. “Now the meeting can begin.”  

But before you can ask what it’s about, the dream fractures. You wake up in bed, sweaty and gasping, the echo of a thousand ticking clocks fading into silence. Was the meeting with yourself… or something else?
