…find a way to survive—and to understand where and when you truly are.

You’re lying on a bed of straw in a small wooden hut. Sunlight filters through the thin gaps between rough-hewn planks. There’s a distinct smell—smoke, damp earth, and something musty like old leather. You push yourself up to a seated position, and the realization that there’s no familiar hum of electricity, no distant sirens or car engines, hits you like a wave. The silence, save for a few muffled voices outside, feels profound.

Stepping through the low doorway, you emerge onto a busy dirt road. A village unfurls before you: wooden carts groan under the weight of hay, and a pair of oxen trudge by under the commands of a bearded man in simple linen garments. You glance down—your clothes are simple too, coarse wool and linen, tied at the waist with a fraying rope. You have no phone, no watch, no wallet. You try to recall the last thing you remember before waking here: your apartment, your phone alarm chirping, the half-open laptop on your desk. Now, those memories feel like distant illusions.

Your stomach rumbles. You need to figure out how to eat, and how to integrate into this new life before anyone suspects you’re not from around here. The language the villagers shout back and forth is familiar yet archaic—like old words from a history book. You catch fragments of conversation: “the harvest,” “the lord’s men,” “the late summer festival.” The cadence of speech is musical yet foreign, as if this language is something your mind is just starting to decode.

The next challenge: currency. You need food, shelter, and some sense of direction, but you have no coins and no goods to barter. You realize you must rely on your wits. Perhaps you can work for a meal, or share some knowledge from your time—though you must be cautious not to reveal too much. Could telling them about simple tools, or demonstrating a knack for healing herbs, make you valuable here?

As you move through the throng, you notice a bustling market. Farmers sell root vegetables from splintered crates; a woman in a gray shawl haggles with a potter over earthenware bowls. You recognize beets, onions, and carrots, though smaller and more gnarled than you’re used to. You wonder if they have bread, cheese, or something filling enough to keep you going.

A young boy with curious eyes tugs at your sleeve. He says something you only half understand, something like, “You’re new, aren’t you?” The accent is thick and lilting. You nod, smiling faintly. He points toward a nearby stall, where an older woman in a faded blue dress sells eggs and butter. She greets you with a nod but narrows her eyes, suspicious of your unfamiliar face. Maybe you can help her somehow—carry crates, mind the stall for a bit, do any menial task that might earn you a loaf of bread.

Before you can speak, a horn sounds in the distance. Heads turn, and a hush falls over the crowd. You follow their gaze to the top of a dirt embankment, where a small retinue of armored riders appears. They wear chainmail and dull iron helmets, their banners snapping in the breeze. The villagers’ postures shift—some straighten up, others bow their heads. The riders approach slowly, as if inspecting the market, and you realize these must be the lord’s men, the ones responsible for maintaining order and collecting taxes.

Your heart thumps. You feel like an intruder in their world. You don’t know their laws, their customs, their boundaries. One wrong move and you could be in serious trouble. But if you can find a way to blend in—perhaps by offering a skill they need—maybe you can earn their trust. You stand by the stall, pretending to adjust a crate of eggs, your mind racing. Maybe you know a trick: how to preserve food better, how to make a simple herbal remedy, something that could mark you as a helpful, if odd, newcomer.

At that moment, a cry goes out. A small child has collapsed near the edge of the market. Villagers rush forward, panicked and uncertain. The child’s face is flushed, breathing shallowly. You know a bit of first aid from your own time—a scrap of modern knowledge that, while no advanced technology, might still be valuable here. You push through the crowd, kneel beside the child, and gently roll them onto their side, checking for any obvious injuries. Your calm demeanor surprises the villagers. Someone hands you a damp cloth. You press it to the child’s forehead, encouraging them to take slow breaths. It’s not much, but it seems to help. The child’s breathing steadies. The crowd murmurs approval.

As you stand, you catch the gaze of the lord’s men. One of them, helmet under his arm, watches you curiously. The woman from the egg stall offers you a small piece of bread with trembling hands. A quiet understanding passes between you and the villagers: you might be a stranger, but you’ve shown kindness and knowledge. They may not understand where you came from, but they’re beginning to see why you’re here.

You take your first cautious bite of bread. It’s coarse and chewy, but nourishing. You’re in this new era now—no modern technology, no easy answers. Just your mind, your empathy, and the skills you can offer. As you stand there, the crowd dispersing, the lord’s men moving on, you realize that this is how you will survive: by adapting, helping, and learning the rhythm of this world, one humble act at a time.
