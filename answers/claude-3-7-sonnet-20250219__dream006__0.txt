You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to feel a strange sensation in your feet. Looking down, you notice the stage floor has become transparent, revealing an endless ocean beneath. The audience doesn't seem concerned, their faces still turned toward you with anticipation.

As you approach the microphone, your notes transform into butterflies, fluttering away into the rafters. You reach for them instinctively, but they're gone. Oddly, you feel a sense of relief rather than panic.

When you open your mouth to speak, your voice emerges as music—a melody you've never heard but somehow know perfectly. The audience sways in unison, their features softening and blending together like watercolors.

The ceiling of the auditorium gradually dissolves, revealing a night sky filled with stars that form constellations spelling out words only you can understand. These celestial messages seem to contain the perfect speech you were meant to deliver.

As you continue "speaking" your musical language, the chairs begin to float gently upward, the audience rising with them, still focused on your performance. You realize you're no longer standing on a stage but hovering above it, conducting this surreal symphony with movements that feel both foreign and natural.

The dream logic tells you this is exactly how it should be—that this is the most important presentation of your life, and everyone understands you perfectly, perhaps better than if you'd given the speech you had planned.
