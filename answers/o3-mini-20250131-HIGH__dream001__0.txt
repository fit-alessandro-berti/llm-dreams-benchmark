You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to move, your feet carrying you along streets that twist unexpectedly and shimmer in the early light of an otherworldly dawn. The sidewalks ripple beneath you, as if the ground were a living canvas painted in surreal strokes of neon and shadow.

At first, you try to retrace your thoughts, searching for any memory of directions or hints of the meeting place. But the city seems to have a will of its own—each turn leads you deeper into winding alleys and open plazas where reality softens into dream. A soft hum, like a half-remembered melody, weaves through the air. You notice that even the buildings seem to breathe, their facades shifting slowly as if they, too, were awake and pondering your destiny.

Determined, you begin to ask passersby—a mysterious stranger in a sharply tailored suit, a whimsical child with eyes full of secrets, even a silent statue whose stone gaze hints at ancient wisdom. Their answers are fragments, cryptic directions that send you toward a grand clock tower in the heart of the city. Time, you realize, is as fluid as the streets around you; clocks melt and reform in the corners of your vision, urging you on with a gentle insistence.

Following the winding path, you eventually arrive at a secluded courtyard, hidden behind an archway adorned with symbols that pulse in time with your heartbeat. Here, in the soft glow of twilight that defies the natural order, you see a circle of figures waiting. Their features are familiar yet somehow otherworldly—each one a reflection of different moments in your life, as if you had gathered every version of yourself into one enchanted meeting.

As you step forward, the urgency of the unknown dissolves into a profound realization: this meeting was never about a place on a map or a scheduled appointment. It was a summons from your own inner self, an invitation to reconcile the disparate pieces of who you are. In the stillness of the courtyard, with the echoes of your footsteps mingling with the murmurs of memory and possibility, you understand that every path you took in the labyrinth of the city was leading you to this very moment.

In that transcendent space, time holds its breath. The faces around you smile knowingly, and you feel an embrace that transcends words—a welcome back to yourself. The dream, with its vivid cityscapes and mysterious guides, reveals its secret: the meeting was never external, but an awakening of the soul. And as you merge with the circle of selves, you find peace in the realization that every journey, every uncertainty, has been a step toward this profound self-discovery.
