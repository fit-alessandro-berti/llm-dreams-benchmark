You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and a shimmering brush hovering in mid-air, dripping with liquid starlight.

Curiosity pulls you closer. You grasp the brush들ts handle warm and pulsing like a heartbeat드nd with a single stroke, the canvas ignites. Swirls of emerald rivers twist into sapphire mountains that fold like origami, unfolding into flocks of crimson birds with wings of molten glass. The colors bleed beyond the edges, leaping into the air to dance around you, whispering secrets in a language of echoes.

But as you paint faster, laughing in delight, the canvas begins to paint *you*. Your skin ripples with fractal patterns, your shadow sprouts tentacles of neon fog, and the ground beneath tilts into a spiral staircase leading upward들nto the sky? Downward, into your own reflection?

Suddenly, the dream fractures like a mirror. Colors drain to grayscale, shapes sharpen into familiar outlines드 bed, a window, the first light of dawn. You wake with paint on your fingers that fades like mist, but the brush's whisper lingers: "Dream again."
