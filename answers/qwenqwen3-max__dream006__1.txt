panic. Your throat tightens. The notecards you’d clutched moments ago are gone—vanished as if they’d never existed. You pat your pockets uselessly, feeling only lint and the cold sweat beading on your palms. The spotlight blinds you; a low hum of anticipation rises from the crowd like a swarm of bees.

Then, something shifts.

From the back of the auditorium, a single voice calls out—not heckling, but gentle, familiar: *“Just say what’s in your heart.”*

You blink. The faces in the crowd aren’t strangers anymore. They’re people you know—your childhood teacher, your grandmother, your best friend from summer camp, even the barista who always gets your order right. They’re not waiting for perfection. They’re waiting for *you*.

You take a breath. And begin.

Not with prepared words, but with truth—halting at first, then stronger, like a river remembering its course. The dream melts the fear away, leaving only the raw, trembling beauty of being utterly seen… and still standing.
