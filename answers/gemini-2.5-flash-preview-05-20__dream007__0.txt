You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **turn away, unable to bear the intensity any longer.**

As you take that first step, the air around you thickens, heavy with unspoken words and rising frustration. Your friend's voice, once sharp and clear, begins to distort, stretching and echoing as if bouncing off unseen, shifting walls. You glance back, and their face, contorted in anger, suddenly *melts*, their features elongating and blurring like wet paint on a canvas.

The room around you, which moments ago was familiar and solid, starts to ripple. The patterns on the wallpaper undulate, the floor beneath your feet feels spongy and unreliable. You try to take another step, but your legs feel heavy, sinking into the softening ground. The colors in the room bleed into one another – the harsh reds of anger, the cool blues of disappointment, merging into a swirling, muddy vortex that threatens to consume everything.

Your friend's voice transforms further, no longer distinct words but a deep, resonant hum that vibrates through your bones, a sound that is both their plea and their rage, amplified and distorted. The furniture around you begins to float, slowly at first, then accelerating, spinning lazily in the thickening air. One of the chairs stretches, its legs becoming impossibly long, reaching towards the ceiling like skeletal fingers.

Panic starts to bubble, but it's a dream-panic – distant and muffled. You realize the argument itself has become a physical force, tearing apart the very fabric of the space you inhabit. The walls dissolve into a shimmering mist, and the ceiling vanishes, revealing an endless, starless void above. Your friend is still there, or rather, their melting, humming essence is, now a swirling, multi-colored anomaly in the dissolving room, their form growing less human, more like a storm cloud of emotion.

You feel a profound sense of release mixed with terror. The ground beneath you gives way entirely, and you are not falling, but *floating*. You rise slowly, effortlessly, past the spinning furniture and the last vestiges of the room, leaving the screaming, formless storm of your friend's emotions behind. The humming fades, replaced by an astonishing silence. You are suspended in that infinite void, completely alone, the chaotic argument transformed into a distant, beautiful, yet terrifying, nebula of color receding far below you, until it's just another unidentifiable star in the infinite quiet.
