begin to notice that the puzzles aren't just testing your mind — they're testing your memories.  

Some puzzles ask you to arrange fragments of your childhood in the right order, others demand you recognize the faces of people you've almost forgotten. As you move deeper into the maze, the walls around you change: sometimes they're ancient stone covered in glowing symbols, sometimes they're mirrors, reflecting distorted versions of yourself.  

You come to a puzzle that stops you cold — it's a door with no handle, just a shimmering surface that ripples like water. A voice, calm but impossible to place, whispers, *"To pass, you must leave something behind."*  

You feel the weight of all your regrets, fears, and secrets pressing against your chest. You realize the maze isn't just a challenge — it's a choice. To move forward, you must shed the parts of yourself that have kept you trapped.  

Taking a deep breath, you place your hand against the rippling surface. Instantly, memories, emotions, old pain swirl out of you like smoke dissolving into the air. The door dissolves too, revealing a warm golden light beyond.  

You step through — and find yourself not at the end of the maze, but at its beginning again. Only now, everything feels lighter, clearer. The puzzles ahead no longer seem insurmountable. They're invitations.  

Would you like me to continue this dream a little further?
