...feel a growing sense of panic as I frantically scan my surroundings, trying to get my bearings. The city seems to stretch on forever, with towering skyscrapers and endless streets that all look the same. I spot a street sign that reads "Maple Street" and a name that sounds vaguely familiar, but I'm not sure if it's relevant to my meeting.

I start to jog down the street, hoping to find someone to ask for directions or a landmark that might help me figure out where I am and where I need to go. As I run, my feet feel heavy and uncoordinated, like I'm running through quicksand. My mind is a jumble of fragmented thoughts and memories, but I can clearly recall the importance of this meeting and the sense of dread that's building in my chest.

Suddenly, I see a group of people gathered around a large, ornate clock tower in the distance. I make a beeline for them, hoping to find some kind of information or a clue about where my meeting is. As I get closer, I realize that the clock tower is surrounded by a maze of narrow alleys and side streets, and I have to navigate through the crowds to get to it.

As I approach the clock tower, I notice that everyone around me seems to be moving in slow motion. They're all staring at me, but no one seems to be noticing that I'm in a hurry. I try to ask one of them for help, but they just smile and nod, and I'm not sure if they're even speaking to me.

The clock tower looms above me, its face gleaming with a surreal, dreamlike quality. I can see that it's 10:45 – 15 minutes until my meeting is supposed to start. I feel a surge of adrenaline as I spot a small, sleek car parked nearby. I sprint towards it, hoping to find a note or a map or something that will help me get to my meeting on time...

Wait, what's this? The car's door opens by itself, and a soft, melodious voice says, "Get in, you're running late." Do I...?
