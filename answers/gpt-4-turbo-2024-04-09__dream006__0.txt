Stepping off the stage, a sense of relief washes over you, mixed with pride for having overcome your fear of improvisation. The dream fades as you mingle with the audience members who are eager to discuss the ideas you shared. In the end, the dream shifts, leaving a lasting impression of growth and unexpected success.
