You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and

…the first circle you drift past is a cluster of old men in tuxedos playing cards on a floating table that hovers a foot above the marble floor. Their cigars don’t produce smoke; instead, tiny galaxies spiral out of the tips and drift upward like lazy jellyfish. One of them looks up, eyes milky with age, and says, “You’re looking for the girl with the clockwork heart, aren’t you?” before dealing you in without asking. You sit, pick up the hand you’re given, and realize every card is a photograph of a different moment from your own childhood. You fold immediately.

You excuse yourself and push deeper into the crowd.

Next you find a group of women dressed in mourning black, but they’re laughing so hard tears run down their veils. They’re passing around a silver tray of what look like ordinary deviled eggs, except each yolk is a tiny glowing sun. One offers you the tray. “Eat one,” she whispers, “and you’ll remember why you came here.” You decline. As you back away, you notice their shadows on the wall are dancing the tango without them.

The ballroom keeps expanding the farther you walk, corridors unfolding like paper fans. You pass a string quartet whose instruments are made of ice; their music is literally freezing the chandeliers mid-drip. You pass a man arguing passionately with his own reflection in a mirror that refuses to match his gestures. You pass children building a bonfire out of unopened letters.

Then you hear your name, faint, like someone speaking it underwater.

You turn down a hallway that definitely wasn’t there a second ago and step into a smaller room lit only by a single candle floating in a bowl of ink. There, standing with their back to you, is the one person you know. They’re wearing the same clothes they wore the last time you saw them in real life, but something’s wrong—their shadow is missing.

You say their name.

They turn slowly, and where their face should be there’s just smooth skin, no eyes, no mouth, nothing. Yet somehow they smile. A hand reaches out (your hand, you realize with a lurch) and places something small and ticking into your palm.

It’s a tiny brass key wound with a red thread.

The candle gutters. The room tilts. The floor becomes the ceiling.

And just before everything dissolves, the faceless version of your friend leans close and whispers in your own voice:

“You were never looking for me.  
You were looking for the door I locked behind you.”

Then the key grows warm, burns a hole straight through your hand, and you fall upward into waking.
