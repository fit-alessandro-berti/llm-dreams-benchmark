...ask passersby for directions, but they all speak a language you don't understand. The cityscape is a mix of futuristic architecture and ancient buildings, creating a surreal and disorienting atmosphere. Despite the language barrier, you try to communicate using gestures and facial expressions, hoping to find someone who can guide you to your meeting.

Suddenly, you spot a clock tower in the distance, its massive hands ticking away the minutes. Realizing time is running out, you decide to take a risk and hop onto a passing hover-vehicle, hoping it might lead you closer to your destination. As you soar above the bustling streets, you catch a glimpse of a familiar logo on a building - it's the company you're supposed to meet with!

With only minutes to spare, you leap off the hover-vehicle and sprint towards the building, your heart pounding in your chest. Just as you reach the entrance, the clock tower strikes the hour, and you can't help but wonder if this incredible journey through a dreamscape city was more than just a lucky coincidence.
