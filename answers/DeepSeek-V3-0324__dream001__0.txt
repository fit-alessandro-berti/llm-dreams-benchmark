run through the crowded streets, the towering buildings casting long shadows that seem to shift and twist as you move. The city feels alive, breathing around you—neon signs flicker in languages you don’t recognize, and the hum of distant conversations blends into an indecipherable murmur.  

Your phone is dead. No maps, no contacts, just a slip of paper in your pocket with an address scribbled in hurried handwriting. You stop a stranger, but their face is blurred, their words dissolving into static before they reach your ears.  

Then, you notice a trail of glowing symbols on the pavement—arrows, numbers, fragments of a path. Are they leading you somewhere, or are they just part of the dream’s illusion? You follow them, heart pounding, as the city’s geometry warps around you. Staircases spiral into the sky, alleyways fold in on themselves, and yet… you feel closer.  

Just as you turn a corner, you see it—a towering glass building with a door that wasn’t there a second ago. The address matches. You step inside, and—  

*What happens next?* Do you wake up? Do you find the meeting? Or does the dream twist again?
