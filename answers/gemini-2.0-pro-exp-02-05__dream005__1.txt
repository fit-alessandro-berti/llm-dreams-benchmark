...and overhear snippets of their bizarre conversations.

The first group, clustered around a punch bowl overflowing with luminous green liquid, are dressed in what appear to be Victorian mourning clothes, complete with black veils and tiny, meticulously-crafted crows perched on their shoulders. I hear one woman say, "...and then Bartholomew, bless his little cotton socks, insisted on burying the goldfish *upside down*! Said it would help it navigate the afterlife better." Another replies, in a voice thick with unshed tears, "Oh, the ingenuity of the young! Mine simply tried to flush it down the toilet, claiming it was a 'submarine to Atlantis'." I quickly move on, feeling a distinct chill despite the warm, humid air.

The next group is gathered around a grand piano, but instead of playing music, they're painstakingly dissecting a giant rubber chicken with surgical instruments. A man with a monocle and a lab coat points a scalpel at a particularly rubbery thigh. "Observe," he announces to his attentive audience, "the remarkably resilient nature of the faux-fowl's musculature. It's quite…*springy*." A woman in a sequined gown nods sagely. "Indeed, Doctor. But have you considered the philosophical implications? Is this…*sentient* springiness?" I decide not to stick around for the answer to that particular existential quandary.

I push further into the throng, the general hum of conversation blending with the clinking of glasses and the unsettling *squawk* of the dissected rubber chicken. I spot a group dressed entirely in shimmering, iridescent scales, their faces obscured by elaborate fish-head masks. They're huddled around a small, ornate fountain filled with what looks like bubbling, viscous oil. One of them dips a finger into the oily substance and brings it to their (masked) lips. "Ah," they sigh, "the finest vintage of motor oil. A robust 10W-40, with hints of…asphalt and regret." Another croaks, "Indeed. You can really taste the road trips." A third, the largest of the group, gestures expansively with a fin-like hand. "It pairs exquisitely with these," he says, producing a plate of what appear to be rusted bolts and screws. "Fresh from the junkyard this morning!"

Suddenly, I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turn, hoping it's my friend, but it's a man wearing a full suit of armor, except the helmet is replaced by a large, hollowed-out watermelon. He holds out a silver platter towards me. On it rests a single, perfectly ripe strawberry…wearing a tiny top hat.

"Would you care for a… *fruity gentleman*?" he asks, his voice muffled by the watermelon.

I just stare. This is getting weirder by the second. I need to find my friend *now*, before I end up accepting a tiny-hatted strawberry and becoming a permanent resident of this surreal, social nightmare. I take a deep breath and plunge back into the crowd, desperately scanning for a familiar face, a beacon of sanity in this sea of utter, delicious, and deeply unsettling absurdity. The faint smell of motor oil and watermelon follows me. And is that...is that the rubber chicken *quacking* again?
