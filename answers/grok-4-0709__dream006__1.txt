You are dreaming. Can you complete the following dream?

You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak. But the words that tumble out aren't the carefully rehearsed ones about climate change or world peace—no, instead, you're reciting the ingredients of your grandmother's secret apple pie recipe, complete with measurements in ancient runes that glow faintly in the air. The audience leans forward, mesmerized, their faces shifting like melting wax: some sprout feathers, others grow extra eyes, all nodding along as if this is the wisdom they've been waiting for.

Emboldened, you gesture dramatically, and suddenly the podium sprouts wings, lifting you into the air above the crowd. "Cinnamon! A dash of nutmeg!" you proclaim, your voice echoing like thunder. The audience erupts into applause that sounds like crashing waves, and one by one, they begin to float up to join you, forming a bizarre aerial conga line. But just as you're about to reveal the final ingredient—love, of course—your teeth start falling out, clattering onto the stage below like tiny porcelain raindrops.

Panic sets in. You try to shout, but your mouth is full of pie crust now, crumbly and sweet. The crowd laughs, not mockingly, but with you, their forms dissolving into swirling colors. And then, in that dream-logic way, you realize you're not on stage at all—you're back in your childhood bedroom, the audience nothing but stuffed animals staring from the shelves. The speech fades into a whisper, and you wake up with the taste of apples on your tongue, wondering if you should call your grandma for that recipe after all.
