**Dream Continuation: *The Last Beacon***

---

The air smells of damp ash and rusted metal as you step over the skeletal remains of a collapsed highway overpass. The sky is a bruised purple, streaked with the faint glow of distant auroras—leftovers of the old world’s dying machines, still bleeding radiation into the atmosphere. Your breath fogs in the cold, and the weight of the scavenged revolver at your hip is the only thing keeping your hands from shaking.

You’ve been walking for days, maybe weeks. Time blurs when hunger gnaws at your ribs and the only water comes from condensation scraped off the husks of dead cars. But you *remember* the map. A tattered thing, drawn on the back of a child’s coloring book, its edges singed. *"The Beacon"*—three words scrawled in frantic ink, circled in red. A rumor. A myth. A place where the old world’s last scientists hoarded seeds, medicine, *hope*.

And you’re the only one who knows where to find it.

### **The Choice at the Crossroads**
Ahead, the road splits:

1. **The Blackened Forest** – A wall of gnarled, petrified trees, their bark oozing a sickly black sap. The locals call it *"The Maw."* Those who enter don’t come back. But the map leads *through* it. If you’re quick, you might avoid the things that hunt in the dark.

2. **The Scavenger’s Bazaar** – A ramshackle encampment of rusted shipping containers and jury-rigged solar panels, humming with the sound of barter and betrayal. The traders here deal in bullets, secrets, and worse. You’ve got nothing to trade… but maybe you don’t *need* to. A whisper in the right ear could get you a guide. Or a knife in the back.

3. **The Abandoned Subway** – The entrance yawns like a rotting mouth, its tiles cracked and covered in graffiti that isn’t quite human. The tunnels are said to connect to the old city’s underground labs. Dangerous? Yes. But the Beacon’s coordinates align *perfectly* with the deepest level. If you dare the dark.

4. **Turn Back** – The voice in your head (is it yours?) hisses that this is madness. The Beacon is a lie. The world is dead. Why not join the raiders at the Bazaar? At least there, you’ll die with a full stomach.

### **The First Sign**
As you hesitate, the wind carries a sound—a *click*. Not a gun. Something mechanical. You turn slowly.

A child stands twenty feet away, no older than ten, her face smudged with dirt and her eyes too old for her years. She’s wearing a patched-up hazmat suit, the hood thrown back to reveal a tangle of dark curls. In her hands, she cradles a **geiger counter**, its needle swinging wildly.

*"You’re the one,"* she says, not a question. *"The map-bearer."*

Before you can react, she tosses something at your feet—a **rusted key**, stamped with the same symbol from your map: a circle bisected by a lightning bolt. *"They’re coming,"* she whispers. *"The Hollow Men. They don’t like people who know things."*

Then she’s gone, vanished into the skeletal remains of a nearby building. But the key is real. Heavy. *Important.*

And in the distance, you hear it—the **droning hum of engines**, growing louder.

### **What Do You Do?**
- **Follow the girl.** She knows more than she’s saying. But children in this world are either liars or bait.
- **Grab the key and run.** The Hollow Men (whoever they are) can’t be worse than the things in the Maw. *Can they?*
- **Hide and wait.** Let the raiders or the Hollow Men pass. Survival first. Answers later.
- **Something else.** (Write-in your move.)

**The dream shifts around you, waiting.** The key burns in your palm. The engines growl closer.

*What’s your next step?*
