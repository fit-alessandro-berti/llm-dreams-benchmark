You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **challenge them to a duel at dawn in a field of glowing fireflies, armed only with water balloons filled with truth serum**. 

The night sky swirls with colors as you both storm off to prepare, but halfway there, the ground ripples like jelly, and suddenly you're both sliding down a massive rainbow slide that loops through candy-cloud mountains. Laughter bubbles up, replacing the anger, and you land in a pile of cotton candy, sharing secrets under a meteor shower that tastes like forgiveness. The dream fades as the fireflies wink out one by one, leaving you waking with a grin.
