**Dream Continuation:**  

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find shelter before nightfall**. The air smells of damp earth and burning wood, and the distant sound of horse-drawn carts clattering over cobblestones confirms you're not in your own time.  

You spot a small village nestled between rolling hills, its thatched roofs glowing golden under the setting sun. The villagers eye you warily—your strange clothing and bewildered expression mark you as an outsider. A kind-looking woman approaches, her hands calloused from years of labor.  

"Lost, traveler?" she asks, her voice warm but cautious.  

You nod, realizing you must adapt quickly. "I... I need a place to stay. And perhaps some work, if there’s any to be had."  

She studies you for a moment before gesturing toward the blacksmith’s forge. "Master Aldric could use an extra pair of hands. If you’re willing to learn, he’ll pay in food and a cot by the fire."  

As you follow her, you wonder: *How did I get here? And more importantly—how do I get back?* But for now, survival comes first.  

*(Would you like to shape the next part of the dream? Or explore this world further?)*
