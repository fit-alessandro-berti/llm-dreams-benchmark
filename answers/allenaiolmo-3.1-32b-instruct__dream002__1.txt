...as you look up, the sky darkens with swirling clouds that seem to gather around you in moments. The wind picks up, rustling the leaves and sending a chill down your spine. A distant rumble of thunder echoes through the trees, growing louder and closer. Rain begins to fall in heavy, cold sheets, soaking you instantly. The once peaceful forest is now alive with the energy of the storm—branches sway violently, and the air crackles with electricity. You search for shelter, your footsteps muffled by the downpour, as flashes of lightning illuminate the dense underbrush. Just as you wonder if you’ll find a safe place, a shaft of blinding light splits the trees, and for a moment, everything is quiet, as if the forest is holding its breath before the next thunderclap.
