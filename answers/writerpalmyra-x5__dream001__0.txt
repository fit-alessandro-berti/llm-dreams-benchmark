…wander the streets, pulse quickening as skyscrapers tilt slightly, their windows blinking like eyes. The sidewalks pulse under your shoes, soft as flesh. You pull out your phone, but the screen shows only a spinning clock and a single app labeled “Map of Intentions.”  

You tap it, and suddenly, directional arrows bloom on the pavement in wet ink, leading toward a monorail that wasn’t there a second ago. It hums, suspended on nothing, swaying like a vine. As you climb aboard, the conductor—face obscured by a hat shaped like a question mark—hands you a badge that reads: *You’re late, but not for the reason you think.*

The train doesn’t move forward. It moves *down*, descending through layers of the city you didn’t know existed—each level quieter, older, filled with people whispering in languages that feel like memories.  

You glance at your watch. The hands are now small silver birds pecking at each other.  

Where do you get off?
