The air crackles between you, thick with unspoken words and hurt feelings. Your friend's usual warmth is replaced by a chilling intensity, their eyes locked onto yours. The disagreement – **whether your loyalty meant supporting their risky career move or being honest about your fears** – hangs heavy, a physical weight in the room. Sweat prickles at your temples despite the dream-world's impossible chill.

"You just don't believe in me," they spit, the words like stones. "After everything."

It twists something deep inside you. The unfairness, the implication you were holding them back, burns. Anger surges, hot and immediate, a familiar fire you want to unleash. But then... **something jars**. A flicker behind their eyes, not just anger, but a raw, terrified vulnerability you recognize instantly. It mirrors your own fear – fear of losing them, fear of them failing, fear of *your* judgment crushing their dream.

The room seems to tilt slightly. A coffee cup on the table giữa you begins to vibrate, emitting a low hum. Outside the window, the sky shifts abruptly from twilight twilight to a bruised, unnatural purple. This is a dream, your subconscious whispers. So why does this *hurt* so much?

Instead of shouting back, the rage coalesces into a single, sharp point of clarity. You take a deep, shuddering breath that feels like dragging air through syrup. Your voice, when it comes, is surprisingly steady, cutting through the humming tension.

**"...decide to dismantle the words that are hurting us both."**

Your hand moves, not towards them in anger, but towards the space between you. You make a plucking gesture, as if grabbing hold of the angry sentences hanging in the air. To your astonishment, *they become visible* – jagged, glowing shards of red light where the hurtful phrases hovered. You grasp one glowing shard labeled "You just don't believe in me." It burns cold in your hand.

Your friend stares, their anger momentarily frozen in disbelief, replaced by wide-eyed confusion. "What...?"

"This word," you hold up the shard, its light pulsing angrily, "...it’s not true. Not the whole truth. I *do* believe in *you*. My fear is for the *path*, the fall. It’s clumsy, maybe selfish, but it’s rooted in love, not doubt." As you speak, the red shard in your hand cracks, turns a softer, warmer pink.

You look at them, really look, past the defensive glare. You see the tremor in their lip, the way they’re gripping the edge of the table so hard their knuckles are white. You remember the shared laughter, the quiet support, the unshakeable bond this argument now threatens. The hum of the coffee cup intensifies, vibrating the surface of the table.

Slowly, deliberately, you place the softened pink shard down on the vibrating table. It sinks slightly into the wood, merging like warm wax.

Then, you reach out, not to touch them, but towards the space near their shoulder. You pluck another invisible shard – this one a deep, bruised blue shaped like "After everything." When you hold it, it feels heavy with abandonment.

"And this..." you say, your voice thick now, "This weaponizes our history. Our 'everything' shouldn't be a shackle. It's the foundation. My fear lives *because* of how much 'everything' means." You focus on the warmth of your shared memories – the late-night talks, the silly jokes, the unwavering presence. The blue shard flickers, then dissolves into a shower of tiny, iridescent bubbles that drift upwards and pop gently, releasing a faint scent of ozone and rain.

The vibration in the room lessens. The purple outside softens to a calmer indigo. The oppressive weight lifts slightly.

Your friend stares at the spot where the blue shard vanished. Their shoulders slump, the fight draining out of them. They look at you, the raw fear still there, but now mixed with something else – tentative recognition.

"You... you're right," they murmur, their voice raspy. "It *was* about the path being scary. And... 'everything' shouldn't be a weapon. It just... it felt like it. Like you were walking away." They reach out a hesitant hand towards the space between you. Their fingers brush the pink shard embedded in the table. It glows brighter, warming under their touch.

You watch them, the anger transformed into a profound ache of understanding. "I'm not walking away," you whisper. "Even if I'm scared shitless standing here."

They meet your gaze, and a single, clear tear escapes, tracing a path down their cheek. But it’s not a tear of despair. It’s a tear of relief, of connection reforged. The impossible chill finally recedes, replaced by a shared warmth radiating from the glowing shard on the table and the lingering sparkle of the popped bubbles. The argument isn't magically solved, but the meanness has been disarmed, leaving only the vulnerability and the love underneath. The dream world feels a little less fractured, the path ahead still uncertain, but now something you might just figure out how to walk together. You take a shaky step closer, the humming finally fading into silence.
