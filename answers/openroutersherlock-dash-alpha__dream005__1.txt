You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and each one draws you in with surreal invitations.

First, a cluster of laughing artists in vibrant, swirling robes surround a glowing canvas that shifts colors like living oil paint. "Join us!" they chorus, handing you a brush that drips liquid starlight. You paint a single stroke, and suddenly the room blooms with impossible flowers that whisper forgotten memories.

Weaving onward, you bump into a circle of musicians whose instruments are made of clouds and thunder. They play a melody that makes your footsteps dance involuntarily, pulling you into a whirlwind waltz where the floor tilts into a starry vortex. Laughter echoes as you spin, glimpsing your friend just beyond—but the music won't let go.

Finally, pressing through a haze of fireflies, you reach a group of storytellers seated on floating cushions. They lean in, eyes like polished obsidian, and offer you a goblet of shimmering nectar. "Drink, and dream their dreams," one murmurs. As you sip, the world fractures into a thousand mirrored versions of the party, each reflecting a different "you" waving from afar.

Your one known face materializes at the center, smiling knowingly. "You've arrived," they say, and the dream dissolves into warm, endless light.
