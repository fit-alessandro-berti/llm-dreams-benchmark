You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to settle it the only way that makes sense in a dream like this: by challenging them to a duel of riddles atop a floating vineyard in the sky. The air is thick with the scent of ripening grapes and storm clouds, and your friend—whose face keeps shifting between their usual self and a mischievous fox spirit—crosses their arms, smirking. "Fine," they say, "but if I win, you admit that the ancient oak tree in our shared backyard is *mine* to whisper secrets to."

The first riddle flies from your lips: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?" Your friend paces the edge of the vine-woven platform, the world below swirling in a kaleidoscope of forgotten memories—childhood picnics, late-night confessions, that one trip where everything went hilariously wrong. They ponder, the grapes around you pulsing like heartbeats, until they grin: "An echo! Now mine: What has roots as nobody sees, is taller than trees, up, up it goes, and yet never grows?"

You laugh, the sound echoing into infinity, because you know this one—it's a mountain, steadfast and unyielding, just like the bond you're fighting over. But as you shout the answer, the sky cracks open, and the vineyard begins to dissolve into rivers of golden sunlight. The argument fades, not with a winner, but with a sudden embrace, your friend turning back into a warm, familiar silhouette. "It was never about the tree," they whisper, as the dream pulls you under like a gentle tide.

You wake up tangled in your sheets, the morning light filtering through the window like spilled wine, wondering if the oak in your real backyard just rustled a little knowingly. What a way to start the day—arguments resolved in dreams are the best kind.
