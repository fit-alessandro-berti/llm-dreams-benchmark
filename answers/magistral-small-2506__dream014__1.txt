feel a wave of relief wash over you as you accept their help. The strangers, a mix of a warm-hearted baker with flour still on her hands, a quiet but observant librarian, and a street musician with a guitar slung over his shoulder, guide you through the city’s winding streets. They point out hidden alleys, secret gardens, and cafes where the walls seem to hum with stories.

As the day fades into twilight, you realize they’ve led you to a quiet rooftop where the city lights twinkle like distant stars. The baker pulls out fresh bread and fruit, the librarian shares a well-worn book of poetry, and the musician strums a melancholic yet comforting tune. You feel less alone now—perhaps the city, with all its chaos, was just waiting to remind you that kindness exists in unexpected places.

The dream softens then, merging into a peaceful, sunlit morning where you wake with the faint echo of laughter still in your ears.
