You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and weave through the crowd, the room stretching impossibly like a funhouse mirror. First, there's a cluster of Victorian gentlemen in top hats, sipping tea from floating porcelain cups, debating the ethics of time travel with such fervor that their mustaches twitch in unison. They nod politely as you pass, but one whispers, "The clocks are melting—watch your step!"

Pushing on, you stumble into a circle of glowing neon aliens, their tentacles draped in feather boas, breakdancing to a symphony of whale songs remixed with elevator music. They pull you into the fray for a spin, their eyes like disco balls, and you laugh until your sides ache, but still no sign of your friend.

The air shimmers, and suddenly you're threading through a coven of librarians dressed as superheroes, shushing each other while hurling encyclopedias like frisbees. One with a cape made of yellowed pages hands you a bookmark that whispers riddles: "What has keys but opens no doors?" You mumble "a piano," and it bursts into confetti.

Deeper in, the party fractures into dream logic—a group of talking houseplants in tuxedos debates photosynthesis politics, their leaves rustling like applause. Then, shadow puppeteers on the walls cast stories of forgotten childhood games, pulling you toward a velvet rope where celebrities from alternate universes (Elvis as a astronaut, Cleopatra DJing) toast with champagne that tastes like cotton candy clouds.

Your heart races; the one familiar face eludes you, morphing the crowd into a kaleidoscope of faces—friends from the past, strangers from the future. Just as frustration peaks, the room spins, and there they are: your one known person, perched on a chandelier made of glowing fireflies, waving a glowing sign that reads "WAKE UP." You reach out, and—

Your eyes flutter open. The alarm clock beeps. Just a dream. Or was it?
