 and you notice that their hands are made of starlight, casting long silver threads that weave through the crowd, parting the sea of faceless commuters like curtains. They don't lead you toward a street sign or subway station, but instead begin to sing—a wordless harmony that makes the glass towers hum in resonance. 

With each step, the concrete beneath your feet softens into moss, and the honking traffic dissolves into the sound of distant waves. One of them—a woman with eyes like vintage photographs—presses a map into your hands, but when you look down, you see it's written in your own handwriting, the ink still wet. 

You realize they aren't taking you home; they're teaching you that you never left it, that the city itself has been breathing around you all along, waiting for you to notice its pulse matching your own. The strangers begin to fade at the edges, but instead of panic, you feel the warmth of their presence settling into your ribcage like a second heart. When you look up again, the street signs have rearranged themselves into your name, and you know exactly which direction to walk—even though every path now leads exactly where you need to go.
