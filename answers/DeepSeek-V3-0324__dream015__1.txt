**Dream Continuation:**  

You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **venture into the ruins of an old research facility**, hoping to find somethingâ€”anythingâ€”that could help you survive. The air is thick with dust, and the flickering remnants of emergency lights cast eerie shadows on the broken walls.  

As you step cautiously through the debris, you hear a faint, rhythmic beeping. Following the sound, you discover a **partially functional AI terminal**, its screen cracked but still displaying fragmented text:  

> *"System reboot initiated... Backup protocols active... User detected."*  

A surge of hope rushes through you. Could this machine hold knowledge, supplies, or even a way to restore some semblance of order? You reach out, hesitating for only a moment before pressing your palm against the scanner. The screen flickers to life, and a voiceâ€”synthetic yet strangely warmâ€”echoes through the ruins:  

**"Welcome, survivor. How may I assist you?"**  

What do you do next?  

1. **Ask about hidden supply caches.**  
2. **Inquire about the cause of the apocalypse.**  
3. **Request a map of safe zones.**  
4. **Try to repair the AI for long-term assistance.**
