...the puzzles become increasingly surreal and interconnected. What started as simple riddles and pattern recognition evolves into challenges that seem to respond to your emotions and thoughts.

You notice that the walls of the maze are made of shifting mirrors, reflecting not just your image, but fragments of memories and possibilities. Each puzzle you solve changes the configuration of the maze itself, opening new pathways while closing others behind you.

Deeper in, you encounter puzzles that require you to collaborate with shadowy figures - alternate versions of yourself from different moments in time. They speak in riddles about choices you haven't made yet, and the solutions emerge not from logic alone, but from understanding the connections between all the versions of yourself scattered throughout this dreamscape.

The air grows thick with the weight of unsolved mysteries, and you realize that some puzzles don't have single answers - they're doorways themselves, leading to chambers where the maze's true purpose awaits. The deeper you go, the more you suspect that you're not just solving the maze...

You're becoming it.
