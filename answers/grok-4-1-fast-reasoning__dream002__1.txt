You feel a storm approaching and the sky cracks open like shattered glass, unleashing torrents of silver rain that tastes like forgotten memories. The trees around you twist and groan, their branches reaching out like skeletal hands, whispering your name in a language of wind and thunder.

You run, heart pounding, but the forest floor shifts beneath your feet, turning to a river of glowing mist. Suddenly, a massive oak ahead splits wide, revealing a hidden door carved with glowing runes. You push through, tumbling into a vast, sunlit meadow where the storm rages above but never touches the vibrant wildflowers blooming in impossible colors.

In the center stands a shimmering figure—a deer with eyes like stars and antlers woven from lightning. It speaks without moving its mouth: "You've been walking in circles, dreamer. What do you seek here?"

Before you can answer, the ground ripples like water, and you begin to float upward, the meadow shrinking below as the storm chases you into the clouds. Wings of iridescent feathers sprout from your back, unbidden, and you soar free, laughing as the dream folds in on itself...

You wake with the echo of thunder in your ears and the scent of wet earth on your skin.
