You are participating in a competition where the grand prize is your dream job. As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and begin to question your own limits. The first challenge is a maze of shifting corridors that change every time you turn a corner. You have to rely on instinct and memory, but the maze seems to reflect your deepest fears—each turn revealing a past failure or an unspoken doubt.

Next, you’re given a riddle by a mysterious figure dressed in shadows. The answer isn’t logical but emotional. It forces you to confront a part of yourself you’ve long ignored—a passion you buried under practicality. When you finally speak the truth, the figure dissolves into light, and the path ahead opens.

As the final round begins, you’re told that the last challenge is not about skill, but about sacrifice. To win, you must give up something precious—your memories of a loved one. The room fills with whispers, tempting you with the allure of success at any cost. But then, you remember why you entered the competition in the first place: not for fame, not for wealth, but to make a difference. You choose instead to walk away.

In that moment, the dream shifts. The competition vanishes, and you find yourself standing in a sunlit field, holding a letter addressed to you. It’s from your future self, saying, “You chose the right path.” And as you read it, you wake up, heart full, knowing that the real dream has only just begun.
