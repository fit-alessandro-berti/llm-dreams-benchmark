Let’s explore this dream together. You’re in a vast, unfamiliar city, feeling the pressure of an important meeting in just an hour, but you don’t know where to go. What do you feel in this moment—panic, curiosity, or perhaps something else? 

As you start to move through the city, what do you notice about your surroundings? Are the streets bustling with people, or eerily quiet? Are there any landmarks, signs, or details that catch your attention? 

What’s your first instinct to solve this problem of finding the meeting location? Do you ask someone for help, search for a map, or follow a hunch? Let’s think through what you might do next and why that feels like the right choice in this dream.
