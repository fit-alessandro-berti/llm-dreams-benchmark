symbols etched into its surface, glowing faintly with an otherworldly light. The patterns shift like living vines, whispering secrets in a language you almost understand. Intrigued, you trace one with your finger, and suddenly the box hums to life, unlocking with a soft click. Inside, nestled on velvet, lies a shimmering key—not for any ordinary door, but one that promises to open the gates of forgotten memories. As you grasp it, the dream world around you blurs, pulling you into a cascade of colors and echoes from your past, where every shadow holds a story waiting to unfold. And just as you step through the first door, the dream fades, leaving you yearning for the next slumber.
