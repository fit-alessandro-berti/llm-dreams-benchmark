You are dreaming. You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and… they *shift*. Not physically, but like looking at an optical illusion. The swirling designs, initially resembling vines and leaves, subtly morph into constellations, then into faces – fleeting, almost recognizable faces of people I haven’t seen in years. My grandmother, a childhood friend, even… myself, but younger.

The box is cool to the touch, made of a dark, polished wood I can’t identify. It feels ancient, yet strangely…alive. There are no hinges visible, no obvious seams. Just smooth, unbroken surfaces covered in these mesmerizing, changing patterns. 

I run my fingers over the surface, tracing the constellations as they bloom and fade. As I do, a faint humming begins, resonating not in my ears, but *within* my chest. The humming grows stronger, and the patterns accelerate, becoming a dizzying kaleidoscope. 

Suddenly, a single symbol glows brightly amidst the chaos – a stylized eye, weeping a single, silver tear. As I focus on it, a voice, not spoken but *felt*, whispers in my mind, “Remember what you’ve forgotten.”

Forgotten? What have I forgotten? I rack my brain, trying to grasp at a lost memory, a hidden truth. The box vibrates now, almost violently. The weeping eye pulses, and I feel a strange pull, a yearning for something just beyond my reach.

Then, I notice something new. The box isn’t resting on a surface. I’m standing in a vast, echoing library, filled with towering bookshelves that stretch into the darkness. The air smells of old paper and dust, and a single shaft of moonlight illuminates the box in my hands. 

And on the floor, directly in front of me, is a single, tarnished silver locket. It’s shaped like a teardrop, mirroring the one falling from the eye on the box. 

Instinctively, I pick up the locket. It’s cold and heavy. As my fingers close around it, the humming from the box stops. The patterns freeze, solidifying into a single, clear image: a winding path leading through a dense, moonlit forest. 

The locket clicks open. Inside, instead of a picture, is a tiny, perfectly formed key. It’s made of the same dark wood as the box, and it feels…right. 

I reach for the box, my hand trembling. But just as I’m about to insert the key, a figure emerges from the shadows of the library. Tall and cloaked, their face hidden in darkness. They raise a hand, and a voice, raspy and ancient, cuts through the silence.

“Are you *sure* you want to know what’s inside?”



And then… I feel myself falling. Not down, but *inward*, as if the library, the box, the locket, and the cloaked figure are all collapsing into a single point within my own mind.



…and I wake up.
