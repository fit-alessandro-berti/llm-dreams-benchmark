You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. The air smells of woodsmoke, damp earth, and something faintly metallic—blood or iron, you can’t tell yet. Sunlight stabs through a slatted wooden roof onto your face. You’re lying on straw that prickles through a coarse linen shirt you definitely weren’t wearing when you went to sleep.

As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **figure out exactly when and where you are before anyone notices you don’t belong**.

The room is small, stone-walled, with a heavy oak door bound in iron. Through the cracks you hear the rhythmic clang of a hammer on anvil, the lowing of oxen, and voices speaking a language that feels like English wearing chainmail—heavy, archaic, every consonant hammered flat.

You sit up too fast and your head swims. There’s a leather pouch at your belt you don’t remember owning. Inside: three silver pennies stamped with a king’s profile you half-recognize (long hair, forked beard… Edward? Alfred? You’re bad at dates), a flint and steel, a small iron knife no longer than your finger, and a scrap of parchment with spidery writing:  
“If thou readst this, keep thy tongue behind thy teeth. Speak little, listen much, and seek the woman with the raven on her shoulder. She knows the way home.”

The door has no lock on the inside. Outside, footsteps approach—heavy, purposeful, accompanied by the jingle of mail.

You have perhaps ten seconds before someone opens that door and sees a stranger in someone else’s bed.

What do you do?
