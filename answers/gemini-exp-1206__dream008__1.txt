... and I freeze. My boss, Mrs. Gable, is tapping her pen against the desk, a rhythmic *tick-tock* that echoes the frantic hammering of my heart. The project is called "Operation Stardust" and the deadline is... tomorrow morning. Operation Stardust? What does that even *mean*?  My cubicle walls, normally a comforting beige, seem to be closing in, morphing into swirling nebulae.

I stammer, "Mrs. Gable, tomorrow... I don't... how...?"

Her pen stops. She leans forward, her glasses perched precariously on her nose, and whispers, "We need you to collect stardust, John. Literal stardust. The kind that falls from the sky. We have reason to believe it holds the key to... well, that's classified. But trust me, it's important."

My mind reels. This is insane. I'm an accountant, not an astronaut. My gaze falls to my keyboard, which suddenly seems to be shimmering, the letters rearranging themselves to form constellations. I blink, and the keys are normal again. Or are they?

Suddenly, the office phone rings. Not my usual desk phone, but a bright red, old-fashioned rotary phone that I've never seen before. It jangles insistently, demanding to be answered. Mrs. Gable nods, her expression strangely serene for someone giving an impossible task.

Hesitantly, I pick up the receiver. "Hello?"

A crackly voice, like static electricity and wind chimes, whispers, "The stardust waits where the city sleeps and the moonbeams dance. Seek the silver thread that connects the earth to the heavens."

The line goes dead. 

I look at Mrs. Gable, completely bewildered. She simply smiles, a knowing glint in her eye, and gestures towards the window.

Outside, the city is a panorama of twinkling lights, but one skyscraper in particular seems to be pulsating with an ethereal glow. At its very top, a thin, silver beam of light stretches upwards, seemingly disappearing into the starry sky. It looks... strangely familiar, like a thread I used to pull loose on my grandmother's old knitted blanket.

My computer screen flickers back to life, but instead of spreadsheets, it displays a single, hand-drawn map. It shows a rooftop garden, a winding staircase, and a single, blooming night-blooming cereus flower, directly beneath the shimmering silver thread.

My heart pounds, a mixture of terror and a strange, inexplicable excitement. I'm an accountant, thrust into a cosmic fairytale. But the impossible has become my reality.

I take a deep breath, grab my jacket – which feels strangely lighter than usual, almost as if it's woven from moonlight – and head towards the door. As I leave, I swear I hear Mrs. Gable whisper, "Good luck, John. And don't forget your butterfly net."  

A butterfly net? What in the universe am I going to do with a butterfly net?  I have to collect stardust by morning, and I have absolutely no idea how. But one thing is certain: this is going to be one very strange night... I wonder if they sell coffee at the top of that skyscraper. I definitely need to stay awake for this. This dream just keeps getting more bizarre, and I can't wait to see what happens next.
