**The waves rise like black mountains, their crests foaming with a ghostly luminescence—bioluminescent algae caught in the storm’s fury. The wind howls through the rigging, a chorus of screaming spirits, and the *Iron Mermaid* groans beneath you, her timbers straining against the ocean’s wrath. Your first mate, a grizzled man with a scar running from his temple to his jaw, grips the wheel beside you, knuckles white.**

*"Captain,"* he shouts over the gale, *"we can’t hold her much longer! The rudder’s near to splintering!"*

You don’t answer at first. Your eyes are fixed on the horizon—or where the horizon *should* be. Instead, there’s only a wall of churning water, and beyond it… something *else*. A light. Not the cold glow of a lighthouse, but a pulsating, sickly green radiance, like a wound in the fabric of the storm itself. It throbs in time with the thunder, as if the sky and sea are breathing.

Then you see *them*.

Silhouettes. Dozens of them, standing atop the waves as if the water were solid ground. Tall, too tall, their limbs elongated like stretched shadows. They don’t move with the storm—they move *through* it, unaffected. And they’re watching you.

Your crew has seen them now too. The bosun drops his rope, his face ashen. The cabin boy whimpers, clutching a tattered saint’s medal. Even the old salt who’s sailed through typhoons and kraken attacks crosses himself and mutters a prayer.

*"Captain…"* your first mate says, voice cracking. *"What in God’s name—?"*

You reach into your coat. Not for a pistol. Not for a spyglass. For the *compass*—the one you took from that wreck off the coast of Madagascar, the one whose needle never points north. The one that *spins* when *they* are near.

The needle is whirling now, faster and faster, until it *stops*. Not on north. Not on any bearing at all. It points *up*.

At the mast.

You follow its gaze.

Hanging from the mainmast, swaying in the wind like a grotesque pendulum, is a *body*. No—*not* a body. A *thing* wearing the *shape* of a man, its skin slick and glistening like oil on water, its fingers too long, its mouth stretched too wide. And it’s *smiling*.

Then it *speaks*.

The sound isn’t a voice. It’s the creak of a drowning ship, the whisper of barnacles on a hull, the last gurgle of a sailor going under. But you *understand* it.

**"You have something that belongs to us."**

The storm stills.

The waves freeze mid-crash.

The green light *expands*, and suddenly you’re not on the *Iron Mermaid* anymore. You’re standing on a shore of black sand, beneath a sky choked with stars that *move*. The air smells of copper and salt and something older than death.

And before you, rising from the tide, is a *city*.

Not ruins. Not wreckage. A city of spires and bridges, of towers carved from coral and bone, humming with that same green light. And at its heart, a throne. And on that throne—

You wake up.

Gasping. Drenched in sweat. Your hands are clenched around the arms of your chair, your nails digging into the wood.

The storm is gone.

The sea is calm.

Your crew is staring at you, wide-eyed.

*"Captain…"* the first mate whispers. *"We’re not moving."*

You look over the rail.

The *Iron Mermaid* is stuck fast. Not on rocks. Not on a reef.

On *sand*.

Black sand.

And beneath the water, just visible in the unnatural stillness, are *roads*.
