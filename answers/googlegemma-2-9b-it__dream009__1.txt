...find a source of water. Sweat clung to my back, a scorching sun beat down on my neck, and the dust beneath my tired feet tasted of salt. Gone were the familiar grey cityscapes, replaced by endless fields of swaying wheat and a sky of impossible blue. I was clothed in rough linen, clinging to an emaciated frame that felt alien to me. My mind, still fogged with the remnants of sleep, grappled with the impossible: I was in the past.

The sun grew lower, casting long, menacing shadows. Panic gnawed at me. I didn't know where I was, how I got here, or even what year it was. But the aching thirst in my throat was a horrifyingly real indicator: I needed water, and fast.

Guided by instinct, I stumbled towards a distant cluster of small, thatched-roofed huts. The air filled with the scent of woodsmoke and a cacophony of unfamiliar sounds – clucking, bleating, a woman’s rhythmic chanting. My shoes, worn like sandals, kicked up dust with every hesitant step. 

As I approached, a young girl, no older than ten, emerged from one of the huts. She stared at me with wide, wary eyes – eyes as deep and brown as the rich earth beneath my feet.

Fear silenced my desperate pleas for water.  Instead, I offered her a small, silver object clutched in my hand – a necklace with a swirling seashell pendant. In the soft light of the setting sun, it glinted, a breathtakingly alien thing in this primitive world.

The girl gasped, her eyes widening further. She gingerly took the necklace, turning it over in her hands, her touch surprisingly gentle.

Hope flared, a fragile ember in the growing darkness. Perhaps this was the key. Perhaps this strange gift could be enough to earn me a sip of water, a moment of safety, and a chance to understand this new, bewildering reality. 


**What happens next?**
