...a brush that seems to be made of solidified moonlight, its bristles shimmering between silver and something that has no name in any waking language.

You pick it up, and the moment your fingers close around it, the canvas exhales. Actually exhales — a soft sigh that smells like the first morning after a long illness, like recovery, like windows thrown open.

You don't decide to paint. The painting decides *through* you.

The first stroke pulls a color from somewhere behind your sternum — a deep, resonant blue that isn't quite blue, more like the feeling of recognizing a stranger's face as someone you've always known. It spreads across the canvas and *hums*.

The shapes refuse to stay still. A circle becomes a doorway becomes a sleeping animal becomes a word in a language you spoke only as an infant. You chase none of them. You let them move.

Around you, the landscape responds. The sky, which had been cycling through geometries — hexagons, spirals, long ribbons of tessellated amber — slows down. It watches.

Other dreamers begin to appear at the edges of your vision, drawn by something. They don't speak. They stand with their hands open at their sides, the universal posture of *receiving*.

— a staircase that leads sideways into warmth
— the sound a lighthouse makes when it finally sees a ship
— every version of yourself that was too frightened to speak
— the color of forgiveness, which turns out to be a very ordinary yellow

Your hand is on the handle.

The moonlight brush dissolves into your palm like sugar in rain.

You turn the handle and—
