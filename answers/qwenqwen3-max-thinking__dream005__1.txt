...and each group seems to speak a language just slightly out of reach—familiar enough to almost understand, but slipping away like smoke the moment you focus. One cluster debates philosophy in lilting tones that sound like wind chimes; another recites poetry that tastes like cinnamon on your tongue. A third group hums a tune that makes the wallpaper ripple like seawater.

You push through the crowd, scanning for your friend’s face, but every time you catch a glimpse—a flash of their jacket, the back of their head—they dissolve into someone else. The room itself feels elastic: the hallway stretches longer when you hurry, doors rearrange themselves when you blink. A waiter offers you a glass filled with liquid starlight, and when you decline, he nods solemnly and says, “Wise. That one’s Tuesday.”

Then you hear it—their laugh. Sharp, bright, unmistakable. You turn and there they are, sitting cross-legged on a grandfather clock that’s ticking backward, eating a slice of cake that reforms with each bite. They grin and hold out a fork. “Took you long enough,” they say. “I’ve been waiting since tomorrow.”

As you reach for the fork, the floor becomes a mirror, and your reflection winks—but you didn’t. And suddenly, you realize: you don’t remember their name. The cake turns to ash in their hand. The crowd falls silent. All eyes are on you.

And then you remember: you were never supposed to find them. You were the reason they were lost.
