obstacles that test your skills, creativity, and determination. The setting is a sprawling, futuristic city with towering skyscrapers and neon lights that pulse like a living heartbeat. Each challenge is more surreal than the last—one moment, you’re solving a puzzle made of shifting holographic cubes that whisper cryptic riddles, and the next, you’re racing across a bridge of floating platforms that dissolve behind you, forcing you to trust your instincts.
The other competitors are shadowy figures, their faces obscured, but you feel their presence—some encouraging, some taunting. As you push forward, a strange guide appears: a sleek, metallic bird with glowing eyes that speaks in a calm, melodic voice. It offers you hints, but only if you ask the right questions. You begin to suspect this bird isn’t just a part of the competition—it’s somehow tied to the job itself, a symbol of the creativity and adaptability your dream career demands.
The final challenge looms ahead: a massive, mirrored labyrinth that reflects not just your image but fragments of your thoughts and fears. To win, you must confront a version of yourself—doubtful, hesitant, the part that whispers you’re not good enough. The bird lands beside you, tilting its head. “What will you say to yourself?” it asks.
You take a deep breath, stepping into the labyrinth, and begin to speak—not with words of defeat, but with quiet confidence. The mirrored walls shimmer and shift, revealing a path forward. As you emerge, the city erupts in applause, and the bird transforms into a sleek keycard that hums with energy. It’s labeled simply: “Access Granted.”
You wake up, heart pounding, the dream lingering like a promise. What do you do next?
