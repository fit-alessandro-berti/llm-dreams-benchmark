 you realize the rooms are breathing.

The first group stands by a fireplace that burns with blue static. They're holding wine glasses filled not with liquid but with hummingbirds, frozen mid-wingbeat. When they speak, their voices come out as your mother's handwriting, looping across the air in cursive smoke. You ask if they've seen your friend—though suddenly you can't remember their name, only the *shape* of knowing them, like a keyhole you can feel but not see. The group laughs, and their teeth chime like wind chimes in a hurricane.

You move through a doorway that becomes a throat. The next cluster of guests are all wearing your face, but stretched over their own bones like poorly fitted masks. They're discussing quantum physics in the voices of your elementary school teachers, and every time they gesture, their hands leave trails of origami cranes that dissolve into sawdust before hitting the floor. You check your phone for a photo of the person you're seeking, but the screen only shows a mirror reflecting a room you haven't entered yet.

The stairs lead upward into a swimming pool. Underwater, a circle of people sit cross-legged on the tile, breathing bubbles that contain tiny, screaming versions of your childhood home. They beckon you to join their séance, but when you reach out, your arm elongates like taffy, stretching across the entire length of the party, through six different decades of wallpaper, until your fingers brush the shoulder of—

There. They've been standing in the corner the whole time, wearing the jacket you lost in 2009. But now there are seven of them, arranged in a semicircle, each one slightly more transparent than the last, like a spectrum of forgetting. The one in the middle smiles with your own mouth and says, "You've been looking for the wrong thing. I was never the anchor. You were looking for the exit."

The walls turn to rice paper. The party guests begin to fold themselves into the geometry of the room, becoming corners and cornices and the spaces between floorboards. Your friend (or the idea of them) extends a hand that is simultaneously a door handle. You grasp it, and the entire gathering inhales—every conversation, every clinking glass, every awkward silence drawn into a single point of light behind your sternum.

You wake up with the taste of key metal in your mouth, realizing that in the dream, you were never the guest. You were the house, learning which rooms to keep lit.
