...overcome each one with flourishes of creativity and competence.  The execution was flawless. I could code anything they threw at me, designed a groundbreaking marketing campaign from scratch using only a pile of sand and a wilted daisy, calmly navigated the buzzing, fluorescent-lit arena of a Kryptonian crystal-powered obstacle course (still not sure how that one worked out in my imagination, but hey, a dreamer can dream!)

The first challenge tested our technical skills. We had to debug a complex, cryptic piece of code – a sentient algorithm, apparently, which had malfunctioned and refused to answer any questions starting with the letter "q". I’d dreamt of being a creature of imagination for as long as I can remember, and this wasn't difficult at all. My fingers flew across the keyboard in my dream, instantly identifying logic errors and syntax glitches.

The second challenge was more abstract – an improvisational improv challenge (yes, even more meta!), hence... the script from bolded text above. In “special host mode”, I had to perform a novel workshop exercise that involved audience participation and transforming a dream journal into a feasible career plan. I aced it, of course!

The arena blurred around me, somehow morphing into a bustling town hall, a cacophony of murmurs replacing the hushed hum of anticipation. I’m standing in front of a nervous crowd, asciiled coaches guiding them, my heart hammering as I realize the peculiar twist: the “Know Your Dreams” event judges are actually craving a counterintuitive performance, something that subverts expectations. And so, instead of sitting in an arena, I'm suddenly writing these fantastical lines...

The crowd was a tangle of slumbering souls, each person slumped over a bed of pillowy clouds cloaked in semi-darkness as if reality itself held its breath. My job? **They wanted to be "inspired".**  

A solar flare exploded across the faux kanji on the whiteboard, casting eerie flickering shadows from the single, bare bulb overhead.  I could see from the way the crowd parted and gasps fluttered like moth wings, I knew I've awakened their interest. My fingers, somehow able to traverse the ethereal keyboard of my resilience training, barely register the need to pause. I grab a yellow highlighter and steam a few luminous notes dissipate into reality, words forming above the heads of the wordsmithy crowd turning real. 

Inspired by this "unconventional" environment I could feel the fear in the room.

Not the nervous kind, the lost-in-a-crowd-of-scientists-with-glowing eyes-and-a-talking-plant-in-the-corner instrucural instructions, those "instructions" whizzing past me as I leaned in. 

The professor had finished addressing the group.  He stared at my bewildered face, his eyes gleaming with an almost manic intensity. He declared, "Congratulations! Today, we're holding a very special presentation. We have... a volunteer whose dream job grant will be helped along by the imminent destruction of the city museum." He then winked at the imagination-stifled hand me the glowstick.”

The talking plant, whose fronds rustled grittily in the fluorescent light every time it swayed its territorial roots away from the bewildered and confused heroes. 

The failed challenges. Many men and women, heads throbbing with jeweled light bulbs, stumbled out of the door, shaking their heads at the absurdity of this bizarre training exercise.

The shadows contorted further, acquiring a life of their own...”

The little green sans-serif squirmed with newfound enthusiasm. 

“I wish you all good luck,” I blurted out, feeling a pang of guilt as I watched the other IS field agents watching me strangely.  “I've been preparing for a situation specifically with your winnings in my backup magic pouch.

 …These were Siamese supernatural kittens, they tell me on the microphone **(a verbal instruction, finally… sensible enough… I think…)**. A new wave of surprise, disappointment, and frankly, confusion, washed over me… they were looking for creativity. Good. The fear subsided. What a fascinating challenge! Psychic #3 – the assistant development lead – of the Dyslexia Challenge grumbled about dismissing their crazy feline companion.  "Look, here,” he said, 
“I know Independence Day is in the past, but there’s no reason why we should have a brand-new employee, who literally coughs up vocabulary words *"neurons," "garnish" and “believe” - it should be a practical side-hustle, like my squirrels are all requesting.


"Ready to unleash a human-sized dose of disappointment, boys? I mean, who loses their copy of the "Wordsmithing" lessons before a promotion?!"   he barked, a little slurred in his speech, the lectorial "good luck" their psychic raccoon printed on a single sheet of paper.
