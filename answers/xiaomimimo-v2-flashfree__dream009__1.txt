As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find a source of light before the sun vanishes behind the jagged, unfamiliar peaks.**

You are standing in a valley overgrown with ferns the size of trees. The air is thick, humid, and smells of sulfur and damp moss. There is no concrete, no distant hum of traffic, not even the sound of a single bird. Just the heavy, rhythmic thrum of insects and the rustle of wind through giant leaves.

You check your pockets instinctively, but they are empty. No phone, no keys, no watch. You are wearing rough-spun linen that scratches your skin.

A cold realization settles in your stomach: survival is immediate.

You spot a cluster of rocks near a trickling stream. It’s the highest point in the immediate area. You scramble up them, your muscles protesting, unused to this raw physical exertion. From the top, you get a clearer view.

To the north, the jungle thins out into a rocky scrubland. In the distance, faintly visible against the darkening purple sky, you see a single, thin curl of smoke. It is the only sign of human existence you can see. It is miles away, perhaps a day’s journey on foot.

But the sun is dropping fast, and the shadows are lengthening into terrifying shapes. You hear a guttural roar echo from the valley floor—something that sounds neither predator nor prey, but ancient.

You need to make a choice, and quickly:

1.  **Seek Shelter:** You notice a hollow beneath the roots of a massive, fallen tree nearby. It’s dark and damp, but it might hide you from the creatures hunting in the twilight. You could try to wait out the night there, shivering and listening to the sounds of the wild.
2.  **Make a Tool:** By the stream, you find a sharp piece of flint and a sturdy branch. It will take time to fashion a crude weapon or tool, time you might not have if the darkness fully descends before you are ready.
3.  **Follow the Stream:** Logic dictates that where there is water, life gathers. If you follow the water downstream, you might find a safer place to rest, or perhaps even a path that leads toward that distant smoke signal.

What do you do?
