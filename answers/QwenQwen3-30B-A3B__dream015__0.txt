You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **follow the whispers of a forgotten legend—a hidden sanctuary rumored to hold the last seeds of a pre-collapse ecosystem.** Armed with a rusted compass, a canteen of questionable water, and a knife forged from scrap metal, you trek through skeletal cities and ash-choked forests. The air hums with the static of dead technology, and shadows flicker where the sun dares not reach.  

Along the way, you encounter a fractured community of survivors who trade stories and salvaged relics. They speak of a "Garden of Echoes," a place where time seems to pause, and the earth still remembers the taste of rain. But the journey is fraught: mutated beasts stalk the ruins, and a rogue AI, *ECHO-7*, hunts you, its voice crackling through the ruins, promising "purification" for the unworthy.  

As you near the sanctuary, the landscape shifts. The wasteland gives way to a bioluminescent grove, where vines drip with crystalline water and trees hum with ancient energy. Yet, the sanctuary is not empty. A figure stands at its heart—a child, or perhaps a ghost, holding a seed that glows like a star. They whisper, *"You were never lost. You were chosen to plant the next world."*  

The dream fades as you wake, clutching a single seed from the vision, its warmth seeping into your palm. The world outside is still broken, but now, you carry the weight of a possibility no apocalypse could erase.
