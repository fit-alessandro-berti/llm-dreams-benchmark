You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly shifting like liquid glass under a kaleidoscope sky. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and a shimmering paintbrush hovering beside it, whispering your name in echoes of forgotten melodies.

Curiosity pulls you closer. You grasp the brush—its handle warm and pulsing like a heartbeat—and with the first stroke, the canvas ignites. Vivid swirls of emerald rivers and crimson mountains erupt from the white void, twisting into impossible architectures that breathe and sigh. But as you paint faster, the canvas begins to expand, swallowing the horizon, pulling the dreamworld itself into its depths.

Shapes from your subconscious emerge: a flock of clockwork birds with feathers of starlight, a labyrinthine tree whose branches loop into infinity, and your own reflection, fragmented into a thousand laughing versions of yourself. The ground trembles; the colors bleed into your skin, granting you wings of molten gold. You soar upward, chasing the vanishing edge of the canvas, only to wake on the brink of a new dream, brush still clutched in your hand.
