You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **plant a garden**. It’s a foolish idea—soil is poisoned, water is sand-thirsty, and every rusted scrap of metal or half-buried can of beans is fought over like treasure. But you’ve found an old seed catalog in a collapsed library, its pages brittle but legible, and you clutch it to your chest like a gospel.  

You scavenge what you can: a cracked rain barrel to collect droplets from the acid sky, a rusted greenhouse frame half-buried in ash. Your hands blister as you dig, the earth screaming as if it resents being touched. For weeks, nothing grows. Then, one morning, a sprout pierces the soot-stained soil—a single green thread, defiant and trembling. You name it *Elias*, after the last person you saw before the world fell apart.  

The dangers come swift. Raiders slash your water barrel. A radioactive wolf circles your camp, eyes glowing like smoldering embers. You sleep with a knife in your hand, but by dawn, you’re tending to Elias, humming a tune you don’t remember learning. One night, as you patch the barrel with scavenged plastic, a girl appears at your fire. She’s no older than twelve, her face streaked with dust, holding a handful of glowing spores from a mutated mushroom. “They grow faster if you sing to them,” she says, nodding at Elias. “My grandma said that before the silence.”  

You don’t ask her name. Together, you build walls of thorny vines that sting intruders, and plant spores in the cracks. The garden becomes a labyrinth—twisted, beautiful, alive. Tomatoes the size of fists, carrots that glow faintly in the dark, flowers that hum when you brush past them. Word spreads. Survivors arrive, wary but hungry. Some stay. Others leave with seeds, their pockets heavy with hope.  

Years later, you stand at the edge of what was once a wasteland. Now, it’s a forest of glass and green, a cathedral of roots and resilience. The girl—now a woman—hands you a seed from a tree you never planted. “For the next dreamer,” she says. You smile, knowing the catalog was right all along: even in the end, there’s always a beginning waiting to sprout.  

And then you wake up, the taste of soil still on your tongue.
