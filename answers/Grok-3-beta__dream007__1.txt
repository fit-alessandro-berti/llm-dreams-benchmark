take a step back and suggest a walk outside to cool off. As you both step into the crisp evening air, the tension begins to ease. The streets are quiet, bathed in the soft glow of streetlights, and the rhythmic crunch of leaves underfoot fills the silence between you. You glance at your friend, noticing the way their shoulders relax, and you feel a flicker of hope that this moment might shift things.
After a few minutes, you find yourselves at a small park, the kind with creaky swings and a rusty slide. Without a word, you both drift toward the swings, sitting side by side like you did as kids. The gentle swaying seems to loosen the knot of frustration in your chest, and you finally say, "I don’t want this to come between us." Your friend looks over, their expression softening, and replies, "Me neither. Let’s figure it out—together." The dream fades as you both start to laugh, the sound echoing faintly in the night, leaving you with a sense of warmth and resolution.
