The first thing you notice is the quiet. Not silence, not the machine hum you’ve mistaken for stillness all your life, but a living quiet: wind combing the grass, a lowing from a byre, the scratch of a hen like someone writing in the dust. The sky is unapologetically large. Smoke wavers from a handful of thatched roofs, and the road is a scar of packed earth that shines with yesterday’s rain.

You sit up from a pile of straw, the sweet-damp smell of it in your hair, a linen sheet rough as a cat’s tongue across your knees. Your hands, accustomed to glass and smooth, thoughtless plastic, are suddenly aware of their own maps: the lines of your palms, the half-moons of your nails rimmed with straw. Your pocket is empty. Your pockets are not even pockets—just a sewn slit, a suggestion of holding.

A woman is at the doorway, her face arranged in the particular patience of someone who has many things to do and will do them with or without you. She makes a sound like a question and hands you a cup of something sour and cold. You nod. You drink. It is milk put through a remembered miracle and it brightens you from tongue to belly. When you speak, when you say I don’t know how I got here, your words fall like odd-shaped stones no one recognizes. The woman tilts her head. She tries again. Her words are made of river-pebbles and wind and the soft rattle of beans in a pod. You are fantastically illiterate.

You step outside. The village notices you the way a field notices a raven: entirely, and without hurry. Children gather. A dog with one ear stands in procession with a dignity that must be ancient. Far off, a bell—not the precise iron of trains or schools, but a bronze voice shaped by a human hand—spills over hills.

There is no weight on your wrist where a watch would be. No phone to anchor your palms. You are untethered in a way that is terrifying and clean. You realize you need to decide, quickly and without rehearsal, who you are without the objects that practiced you all these years.

First, you need to be fed. That is answered by the hollowed loaf the woman presses into your hands, its crust dark as a storm. Then, you need to be useful. Work is a language. Work will translate you when your mouth cannot. You pantomime a question: point to your hands, to the roofs, to the well. The woman considers, the way a hawk considers wind, then nods toward a ladder propped against a roof bare of reed. The reeds lie stacked, tall as boys. You climb. The rungs groan like honest wood. On the ridge, you find the bundle knots themselves telling you what they want. You know nothing and yet your fingers recall a bowline, the way your father taught you while pretending it was for boats and not for anything that might pull you out of a hole. You show the knot to a man with a beard like barley. He laughs, a currency you recognize, and the knot stays put. You are paid in bread and a smear of honey that tastes like the inside of a flower.

The days arrange themselves into a calendar made of chores. You carry water. You learn the weight of empty and the song it makes when it becomes full. You turn a quern-stone, feeling in your shoulder the way grain gives itself up to meal. You burn your fingers, once, on an iron hung too cleverly in the coals, and everyone laughs, including you, because the way back to human is paved with small humiliations.

Evenings, they gather under a sky unpierced by wire, and you are asked for a story. You mime a rectangle glowing in your palm, a window that fits in your hand, and their faces reflect the imagined light as if believing were enough to be warmed by the fire you describe. You tell them of voices that travel without bodies, of the ocean of other minds you swam in every day without getting wet. They put a name to your pantomime that translates, roughly, to captured dawn. The children practice the two-handed shape of it until their laughter shakes it free, and it floats upward, joining words for wind and river and hunger. Someone leans close and—you think—asks the word for how to carry such a dawn. You show them your empty hands. You shrug. You laugh with your face and your shoulders and a kind of helplessness that is, embarrassingly, also relief.

You realize you need to learn the language, yes, but first you need to learn the threshold where your desire to explain becomes your instinct to listen. In the dream, this is a door that opens inward. You step through.

You begin to collect answers you didn’t know you were missing. The names of clouds are not Latin here; they are tender insults and weather-proverbs and the way a grandmother’s jaw sets when snow is coming. Time is a bruise of sunlight moving along the floor. The newest thing anyone owns is a baby. Perfection is not a word they use.

There are things you can offer. You remember a trick with a stick and shadow: a way to find north when the sky sulks and refuses stars. You press a straight branch into the dirt and watch the tip's slow arc, marking it with pebbles. The men who spend their days walking behind oxen nod, take the measure of it, file it somewhere useful. You recall a way to keep milk sweet longer by lowering it into the well. An old woman snorts, amused—you think—and shows you her stone-lined niche right there by the steps, cool as a cave. You realize that your clever is not their clever. You are not here to rescue anyone from anything.

Winter arrives like a story we all knew was coming but told ourselves would surprise us anyway. The fields lie down and pull the sky over themselves. Hunger becomes a character that sits near the fire, not unfriendly but not to be looked at directly. You learn to card wool until your hands hum with fine barbs. You learn that quiet is a room with chairs in it: one for grief, one for patience, one for the kind of joy that is just the right word at the bottom of a cup.

One night, a child is born, dark hair slick as riverweed. The midwife’s hands are stained with the old world’s stubbornness. Someone pushes you out, then pulls you back in, because an extra pair of hands is useful even when it is clumsy. The room smells like iron and lavender and fate. You hold the lamp. You become a hinge the rest of the night swings on. In the morning, a new person is here, and somehow, even here, even now, they will grow up using tools you cannot imagine, and all your wanting to keep them safe is an echo inside a shell. You realize you need to choose, if the dream keeps you, what one thing you will try to carry across the water between eras.

You choose a recipe. Not for bread—that is older than grief—but for how to leave a message in a place that has no paper, no ink that lasts. You find clay by the river, the fine, gummy kind that clings to your ankles. You knead it like forgiveness. With a twig, you press symbols into it: a circle for the sun, lines for rain, the little plant you have learned to draw for hope because it looks like both hands and a sprout. You press your thumb in: your print, the whorls like a galaxy you forgot you were carrying. You bake the tablets in the coals till they sing if you tap them. You bury one under the threshold. You give one to the child. You tuck one into the wall where a beam meets the stone. You tell yourself that if anyone finds them, if anyone asks what a stranger meant by these pictures, they will make their own story to fit the shapes. You realize it has always worked like that.

Spring. The roads are ribbons of hopeful mud. The bell rings again, and on its bronze you see your face made flexible by smoke. You do not look like the person who learned to be useful by tapping a glass. You look like the person who remembers, under everything, that you were made for this: to carry water, to laugh in a language you love badly, to stand under a sky that does not need your naming to be vast.

When you finally wake—the new morning an old one, your bed a clever array of pillows and polymer—you bring the quiet with you, some of it, like a pocket full of clean stones. Your phone, found under the duvet, is warm and self-important. You hold it the way you held the lamp: carefully, aware of the heat you are lending it. Its glass is a kind of water. Your hands are still your hands. There is a crescent of clay under your thumbnail you do not remember earning. For a moment, you can still taste honey that has never seen a barcode. You have, inexplicably, the itch to tie something that will not come loose.

You realize you need to do something small and honest in this era that your dreaming self would recognize. You get up. You pour water. You step out to a sky made of the same sky. You plant a seed in the stubborn dirt of your day, and this time, you don’t reach for a rectangle of captured dawn to tell anyone about it. You leave a message anyway—in the way the soil sits under your nails, in the knot you tie when you take out the trash and it holds, in the story you will tell tonight under electric light, about a bell that sounded like a bronze river and a room where time was an ember you could warm your hands at.
