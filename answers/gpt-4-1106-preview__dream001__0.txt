panic as the unfamiliar streets twist and turn in ways that don't make sense. Skyscrapers loom over you, casting long shadows that seem to play tricks on your eyes. People rush past, indifferent to your plight, their faces blurred and unrecognizable.

In the dream, you pull out your phone to check for directions, but the screen is glitching wildly, flickering between maps, messages, and images that you can't quite make out. The battery icon flashes red, and just before the screen goes dark, you catch a glimpse of an address that could be where you're supposed to go.

With the phone now dead, you try to recall the address but it's like grasping at smoke, the numbers and street name slipping from your memory. You look around and notice a taxi with its light on. You rush over and hop in, hoping the driver can help.

The cabbie nods when you tell him about your meeting, but admits that the address is not familiar. However, he assures you that he'll do his best to find it. The city outside the cab shifts as you drive, landscapes blending together in a surreal mix. The taxi driver appears unphased by the oddities, navigating with impossible precision.

You check your watch and see that time is behaving oddly, minutes either stretching out or speeding by in the blink of an eye. Desperation sets in as you realize time is running out. You start to sweat, the inside of the taxi becoming oppressively warm.

The cabbie suddenly pulls over in front of a grand building whose entrance is flanked by statues. You don't recognize the place, but somehow you're confident this is where you need to be. You hand the taxi driver some cash, not even looking at the denomination, and step out of the cab.

As you approach the building, the doors open automatically, and you are greeted by a lobby that's both grandiose and oddly welcoming. The dreamlike state continues; people in the lobby seem to glide rather than walk, their conversations a symphony of sounds you can't quite understand.

A receptionist with an enigmatic smile greets you, saying they've been expecting you and hands you a visitor's badge. You pin it onto your shirt, but when you look down, the name on the badge isn't yours. Before you can question it, you're ushered to an elevator. Its doors close, and you feel a lurching sensation as it ascends. As the elevator climbs, the reality of the waking world begins to seep in, and the dream starts to slip away—the building, the city, the meeting, all dissolving into the ether of your subconscious.

You wake up, the contours of the dream rapidly fading, yet the feeling of urgent confusion lingers momentarily before you shake it off and greet the day.
