You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and **the air grows heavy, thick with the scent of ozone and crushed pine needles. The birds fall silent all at once, as if an invisible hand has muted the world.**

Above, the sky bruises rapidly, shifting from a soft azure to a churning tapestry of violet and charcoal. The wind doesn't just blow; it rushes through the canopy with a low, mournful hum, causing the ancient oaks to bow deeply, their leaves flashing silver undersides in warning.

Instead of running, a strange calm washes over you. You realize this isn't a normal storm. As the first drops fall, they don't feel like water—they feel like warm, liquid light, glowing faintly as they hit the forest floor. Where they land, the moss instantly blooms into vibrant, bioluminescent flowers that pulse in rhythm with the rolling thunder.

The storm breaks fully, but there is no violence, only a deafening, beautiful crescendo of sound and color. The rain intensifies, turning the forest path into a river of starlight. You look up, letting the luminous rain soak your clothes, and realize the trees are singing—a deep, resonant vibration that you feel in your bones rather than hear with your ears.

In the heart of this surreal tempest, a path opens up that wasn't there before, lined with floating lanterns made of storm clouds. You feel an irresistible pull toward it, knowing that if you walk down this new trail, you won't just wake up; you'll wake up somewhere entirely new, carrying the memory of the singing forest in your pocket like a secret treasure.

You take the first step, and the dream deepens, swirling around you like a cocoon of rain and song.
