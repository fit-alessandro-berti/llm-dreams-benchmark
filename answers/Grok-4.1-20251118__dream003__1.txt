…intricate patterns that seem to shift when you’re not looking directly at them, like schools of silver fish darting just beneath the lacquered surface. The wood is warm, almost feverish to the touch, and when you press your ear against it you swear you hear a faint heartbeat (not yours).

Your fingers trace the carvings: spirals that tighten into eyes, eyes that dissolve into wings, wings that fold back into labyrinths. There is no clasp, no hinge, no seam you can detect, yet the lid feels… expectant. As if it’s waiting for permission rather than force.

Then the patterns stop moving.

One of the eyes (an owl’s eye, ancient and gold-flecked) locks onto yours. It blinks. Slowly.

A voice, soft as moth wings but vast enough to fill the entire dream, speaks from inside the box and inside your skull at the same time:

“You were never meant to open me with hands.”

The lid sighs upward on its own, just a finger’s breadth. A ribbon of night spills out (not darkness, but actual night): constellations, nebulae, the smell of rain on a planet that has never known a sun. It coils around your wrists like smoke made of memories you haven’t lived yet.

Inside the box is a mirror.

But the reflection is not you.

It’s you, older, eyes made of the same shifting silver as the patterns, holding the same box (empty now). That older you smiles with a sadness sharp enough to cut glass and says:

“Close it before you forget which one of us is the dream.”

The lid begins to fall.

You have one heartbeat to decide: reach in and touch the mirror, or slam the box shut forever.

What do you do?
