...and the air is thick with a confusing medley of perfumes, booming laughter, and the clinking of glasses that seem to be perpetually refilling themselves.

My eyes scan the shifting kaleidoscope of faces. I spot a group huddled near a fountain that's spewing what looks suspiciously like iridescent lemonade. They're all wearing elaborately feathered masks, their voices muffled and conspiratorial. One of them, with peacock feathers fanning from their head, gestures wildly with a hand that seems to have too many fingers. As I pass, the lemonade in the fountain momentarily turns into tiny, shimmering fish that leap into the air before dissolving back into liquid. Definitely not my friend, Sarah, who's allergic to most seafood and despises ostentation.

I push past a curtain of what feels like spun moonlight – cool and surprisingly solid – and find myself in a quieter alcove. Here, a group of people are dressed in what appear to be vintage beekeeper outfits, complete with veils. They're not talking, but humming, a low, resonant thrum that vibrates through the floorboards. In the center of their circle, a single, enormous sunflower glows with an internal light, its petals slowly rotating. One beekeeper offers me a honeycomb, but the cells are filled with tiny, ticking clock faces instead of honey. "Time is sweet, but fleeting," they seem to buzz, though no one actually speaks. Sarah is terrified of bees. I back away slowly.

The music shifts, a sudden lurch from a stately waltz to a frantic, percussive beat played on instruments I can't identify – something like steel drums crossed with wind chimes made of bone. I'm drawn towards it and find a circle of people dancing with joyful abandon, their limbs loose and fluid, almost boneless. Their shadows, however, are dancing a completely different, much more formal dance on the wall behind them. One dancer, a woman with hair like spun copper, grins at me, and for a moment, her eyes are swirling nebulas. "Join us!" she laughs, her voice echoing as if from a great distance. "The rhythm will find you!" While Sarah loves to dance, she prefers something with a predictable beat.

I'm starting to feel a familiar dream-panic, the one where you know you're looking for something vital but can't quite grasp it. The room seems to stretch and distort. I round a pillar that feels warm, like skin, and there, in a relatively quiet corner, under a chandelier dripping with what looks like actual dewdrops, is Sarah.

She's not talking to anyone. She's sitting on a velvet ottoman, completely absorbed in trying to teach a small, fluffy white rabbit how to play chess. The rabbit, with a disturbingly intelligent glint in its pink eyes, nudges a pawn forward with its nose.

Sarah looks up, sees me, and a huge smile of relief spreads across her face. "Oh, thank goodness you're here!" she exclaims, her voice perfectly normal, a comforting anchor in this sea of strangeness. "I was starting to think I was the only sane one. And you will *not* believe the opening move this rabbit just made!"

I pull up another ottoman, the dream-panic receding, replaced by a comfortable sense of shared absurdity. "Queen's Gambit again?" I ask, settling in. The rabbit twitches its whiskers, as if considering its next move. The party fades into a bizarre, colourful hum around us.
