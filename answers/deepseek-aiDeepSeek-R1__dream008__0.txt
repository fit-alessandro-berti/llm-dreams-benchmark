**Dream Continuation:**  

You stare at the screen, hands trembling, as the deadline glows red—*48 hours*. A mountain of tasks looms: reports, code, client calls. Your boss’s shadow stretches across your desk, silent, expectant. You open your mouth to explain, but your voice vanishes. The clock on the wall ticks backward.  

Suddenly, your keyboard melts into liquid, letters pooling into alphabet soup. The spreadsheet cells multiply like fractals, numbers spiraling into infinity. Panic rises, but then—*a laugh*. Your coworker, long-retired, materializes beside you. “Here,” they say, handing you a pen that glows like a neon sign. “Write the due date *here*.” They point to the air.  

You scribble *48 hours* in glowing ink, and the digits detach, floating upward. Time slows. The office dissolves into a meadow. Your boss is now a sunflower, nodding approvingly. Tasks transform into origami birds, folding themselves. You wake just as the last bird takes flight.  

**Morning After:**  
You sit up, heart racing, but the panic feels distant. The dream’s absurdity lingers—a reminder: *impossible deadlines shrink when you stop fighting time… and start bending the rules*. You open your laptop. Maybe today, you’ll ask for help. Or negotiate. Or laugh.  

(Note: Dreams love metaphors. What “bending the rules” means is yours to unravel.)
