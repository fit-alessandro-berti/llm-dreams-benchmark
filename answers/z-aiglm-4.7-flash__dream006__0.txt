begin to speak, but the words don't form correctly. Instead of a greeting, I accidentally shout, "I am a toaster!"

The crowd erupts into laughter, and I look down to find that my shirt has suddenly turned into a slice of burnt toast and my shoes have turned into waffles. They cheer louder, waiting for me to "pop," and I realize with a rising panic that I am actually stuck on a plate, surrounded by hungry forks that are sharpening themselves.
