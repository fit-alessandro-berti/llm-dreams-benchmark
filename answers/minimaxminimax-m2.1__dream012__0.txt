# The Captain's Watch

I grip the helm with white-knuckled determination as salt spray lashes my face. The mast groans like a wounded beast, and somewhere below deck, water rushes in—a steady, ominous sound that matches the hammering of my heart.

"Captain!" The first mate's voice tears through the wind, raw with fear. "The waves—they're taller than the mast!"

I look up, and my breath catches. The sea has risen around us like a living wall, darkness churning in the depths of each swell. Lightning illuminates the horizon in jagged pulses, and for one terrible moment, I see it—not just a storm, but something ancient stirring beneath the waves. Something that's been waiting.

The crew presses closer, their faces pale moons in the chaos. Young Thomas, barely seventeen, grips the railing so hard his knuckles match the wood. Old Maren, who has sailed forty years and never once prayed, is whispering something I cannot hear.

They need me to be fearless. They need me to have an answer.

And then, quietly, I realize something shifts inside my chest. Not courage exactly—courage implies no fear, and I am terrified. But something deeper. A stillness at the eye of my storm.

I release one hand from the helm and place it flat against the wooden wheel, feeling the ship breathe beneath my palm. She has carried me through calmer waters. She has never failed me—not when I deserved failure, not when I was uncertain.

"The lanterns," I call out, my voice cutting through the wind. "Light all of them. Every single one."

The crew hesitates—a heartbeat too long.

"*Now*."

They move. And as golden light begins to dot our vessel like captured stars, I turn us not away from the darkness, but *toward* it. Toward the heart of the storm. Because I've realized something in this strange dreaming place: the sea cannot swallow what refuses to be swallowed. The night cannot consume what creates its own light.

The waves rise to meet us, and I meet them right back.

*I wake with salt on my lips and the echo of a ship's bell still ringing in my ears.*
