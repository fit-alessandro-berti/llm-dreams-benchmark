…plant a garden.

You kneel among concrete ribs and twisted rebar, palms raw from the grit, and dig where a stray sprout crept up through a crack. The air tastes of ash and copper, but when you press your fingers into the cold earth you feel something stubborn and real: dark, smelling of rain that hasn’t fallen yet. You have a handful of mismatched seeds—a packet with a faded sunflower, a jar of lentils, a few hard beans wrapped in grease-stained cloth—a library of things that can become food. Beside them lies a dog-eared book whose spine is gone, pages flapping like tired wings. You tuck the seeds into the soil and lay the pages around them like a circle of protection, reading aloud words that remind you how to name things.

Night after night you shape that patch into a small geometry of hope. You haul discarded pallets to make beds, set a rain-catcher fashioned from a dented satellite dish, scatter crushed glass into paths so the rust-quiet animals learn where not to tread. The first shoot is a fragile green spear, then a cluster of leaves, then a stubborn sunflower turning its face toward a pale, wounded sun. People come. At first it is one: a woman with a scarecrow’s hat and a watch that no longer tells time. Then a child who has never tasted fresh peas and a man who can mend a pipe with a strip of leather and an idea. They bring seeds, stories, a pot, a small bell. You trade: a handful of grain for a story of a river that still flows; extra beans for the knowledge of how to coax water from a buried pipe. You teach the child how to press a seed into the soil and how to wait, and the child teaches you to laugh despite the wind that forever wants to strip the world bare.

The garden becomes more than food. You pin bird-feather wind chimes from wrecked radios to scare the rats and call the few brave birds back. You use the book’s pages to record names of those who pass—no bureaucratic lists, just inked sentences that smell faintly of smoke and hope. When frost comes you cover the beds with old coats and hot coals, and someone constructs a small glass frame from a bus window to shelter the seedlings from the hard breath of winter. A beacon is born: a iron-topped barrel where the community burns trimmed branches and leaves to dry the seeds and heat hands. At night its glow is a small, steady heartbeat against the long ribs of the ruined city.

There are dangers: raids for copper, storms that hollow out a roof, nights when the sky looks like a peeled orange—thin and raw. But for every loss there is a repair, a lesson learned. You teach how to read the clouds and treat an infected scrape; others teach you how to barter for clay and to sing softly while you weed. People begin to leave markers—a painted stone, a carved stick—to guide one another through broken avenues. The map of the living grows.

One morning a lone plane, a thin speck against the cracked enamel of the sky, makes a slow circuit and leaves behind a dark plume that washes like ink. The sunflower you planted has opened its head wide and is full of bees. A child plucks a pea and eats it like it is magic. You realize the act you chose was not merely survival but invitation: soil and stories, food and names. What you planted was a reason for other hands to come, and for lungs to breathe differently.

You dig again—deeper, firmer—and drop another seed into the dark. The wind tries to take the sound of your laughter, but the laugh has roots now. The dream folds as you stand, palms dirty and certain, watching life remember how to insist.
