You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the sky above transforms in an instant—thick, charcoal clouds roll in like rolling waves, swallowing the warm sunlight. The air grows heavy, charged with electricity, and the scent of rain and earth rises sharply around you.

The first fat drops of rain begin to fall, pinging softly against the broad leaves of the oak and maple trees. A distant rumble of thunder rolls across the valley, and you realize you need shelter—fast.

You spot a large hollowed-out oak just ahead, its massive trunk scarred by time but sturdy enough to provide cover. You quicken your pace, the rain now falling in earnest, soaking through your clothes. As you squeeze into the dry hollow, lightning forks across the sky, illuminating the forest in stark white brilliance. The trees sway and groan in the strengthening wind.

Inside your sanctuary, you catch your breath and watch the storm rage around you. The rain hammers the forest canopy, creating a symphony of sound. Somewhere in the distance, you hear the rush of water as a small stream swells with runoff.

Then, just as quickly as it arrived, the storm begins to pass. The rain softens to a gentle patter, and shafts of golden light break through the retreating clouds. A double rainbow arches across the sky, its colors vivid against the fresh, washed air.

Do you emerge from your shelter to continue your walk, or do you stay and listen to the forest settle?
