…completely wrong.

They’re not about the material you studied, not about equations or theories or the dense pages you highlighted at 3 a.m.

They’re about **you**.

The first question reads:

> 1. Explain, in detail, why you chose this path.

The multiple-choice options are strange:

A. Because it was expected of you
B. Because you were afraid of the alternative
C. Because you didn’t know you had a choice
D. Other: _____________

Your pencil feels heavy. You look around to see if anyone else is as confused as you, but the other students are hunched over their papers, scribbling furiously. Their pens move in perfect unbroken lines, like they’ve been preparing for this exact question their entire lives.

You glance back at your exam. The question has changed.

Now it says:

> 1. When you were younger, what did you actually want to do?

Underneath is a blank space that stretches across the whole page, far too much room for such a small, buried answer.

You try to remember. Your memories feel like a deck of cards being shuffled too fast: flashes of colors, a childhood bedroom, an old dream you had about building something that didn’t exist yet. Every time you reach for a specific image, it slides away.

Your heart starts to race. This exam determines your entire future and it doesn’t care about formulas or facts, only about these slippery, personal things you never studied.

You flip to the next page, hoping for something more familiar.

> 2. Identify the exact moment you stopped being honest with yourself. Show your work.

Below the question are faint diagrams that look like timelines, but instead of dates they’re labeled with feelings: “Excitement,” “Fear,” “Duty,” “Numbness.” You’re supposed to draw a line chart, apparently, tracking how those rose and fell over time.

You glance up at the clock. It has no numbers, just a smooth white face and three hands spinning at different speeds, none of them in sync.

The exam proctor stands at the front of the room, arms folded. Their face is blurry, like a portrait you’re not supposed to focus on. You raise your hand.

“Excuse me,” you say, your voice much smaller than you expect. “I think I have the wrong exam.”

The proctor tilts their head. “No,” they say, and their voice sounds like more than one person speaking at once. “This is exactly the right exam for you.”

You swallow. “But I don’t… I don’t know these answers.”

The proctor walks slowly down the aisle toward you. As they pass each desk, the students they move by flicker, turning for a second into different versions of you: you at age 8, you at 16, you last year, you two weeks ago staring at a computer screen way past midnight.

When the proctor reaches your desk, they don’t look blurry anymore. They look like you, just a little older. A little more tired. A little more certain.

They lean down and whisper, “You’re not being graded on correctness.”

“How am I being graded?” you ask.

“On honesty.”

They straighten up and walk back to the front of the room. As soon as they turn away, you realize you don’t remember their face anymore, only the way your own eyes looked when they met yours.

You lower your gaze back to the exam.

Question 3 wasn’t there before.

> 3. List three lives you might have lived if you weren’t afraid.

The lines on the page ripple like water when you stare at them too long. You think of different versions of yourself: one who moved away, one who never did, one who took that risk, one who stayed safe. Each version feels real enough that for a split second you can feel their weight in your body, like trying on someone else’s coat.

Your pencil finally moves. Slowly at first. Then faster.

You write one life.

Then another.

Then a third.

Your handwriting keeps changing styles, like you’re borrowing it from different versions of you. Some letters are careful and neat, others jagged and rushed. The words don’t feel perfect, but they feel true enough that your chest hurts a little.

When you finish, the lights in the room dim. Not off—just softer, warmer. You notice some of the other students have stopped writing. They’re looking around, confused, as if waking up in the middle of a movie they were very invested in.

You check the clock again. It’s still blank, but now there’s only one hand, and it’s not moving at all.

You flip to the last page.

There’s only one final question, and it takes up the entire sheet.

> 4. Do you want the future this exam is leading you toward?
>
> □ Yes
> □ No
> □ I’m not sure

There’s a fourth option under those, one that’s been hastily added in crooked handwriting:

> □ I want to choose again

The room is silent. You can hear the faint scratch of pens, the creak of chairs, the distant humming of something that might be air conditioning or might be your own thoughts vibrating.

You look at the boxes.

You know what you’re *supposed* to check. That’s obvious. That’s the path that’s been laid out and rehearsed and predicted.

But your hand doesn’t move.

You notice, for the first time, that the exam paper isn’t actually on the desk—it’s resting on your lap. The desk in front of you is empty, bare. You lift your head.

The classroom walls have faded. They’re not solid anymore, just loose outlines, like someone forgot to finish sketching them. Through them, you can see glimpses of other rooms, other scenes: a studio with half-finished projects, a train station board full of departure times, a quiet kitchen at dawn, a map with too many pins and not enough strings.

Your heartbeat slows. A thought arrives:

*This is a dream.*

As soon as you think it, the paper in your hands shivers.

The multiple-choice boxes blur and merge into a single open line:

> 4. What do you want your next step to be?

You hesitate. It feels like a trick. In real life, you’re used to questions that have right answers, allowed answers, answers that fit neatly into what’s expected.

But this one doesn’t.

You press your pencil to the page. The point sinks in deeper than it should, like you’re writing into something thicker than paper. You don’t write a grand life plan or a ten-year roadmap. You write something small and specific and strangely simple—just the next honest step you can imagine taking from where you are now.

The word (or sentence, or messy fragment) appears darker than everything else on the page, as if it’s been printed instead of written.

The desk fades completely. The other students dissolve into drifting outlines, then into nothing. The clock melts into a bright, hazy circle that could be a window, or the sun, or a blank screen waiting for input.

You feel the floor disappear beneath your feet—but instead of falling, you feel like you’re floating, held in place by the weight of the answer you just gave.

Somewhere, very far away and also very close, you hear the proctor’s voice again, calm and satisfied:

“Time’s up. That’s enough for today.”

Your exam slips from your hands and doesn’t hit the ground. It just turns into white light.

You blink.

You’re in your real bed, or maybe on your real couch, the remnants of the dream still clinging to you like fog. You can’t remember every question, not clearly, but one thing stays with you:

That last one.

You don’t remember exactly what you wrote…

…but you remember how it felt to finally answer it.
