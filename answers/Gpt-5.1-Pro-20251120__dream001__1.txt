…run.

Not fast—your legs feel like they’re full of wet sand—but you *try* to run. The sidewalk stretches out like chewing gum, every step landing you only a little farther ahead than before. Cars go by in slow motion, their headlights smearing into long white ribbons. No one looks at you, even when you bump into them.

You pat your pockets. No phone. No watch. Just a folded piece of paper you don’t remember having.

You stop under a flickering streetlight and open it. The paper is blank—then, as you stare, ink seeps up from underneath the surface, like something writing from the other side.

**MEETING: 3:00 PM**
**LOCATION: ??**
**STATUS: LATE**

You glance up at the sky. It’s late afternoon, except when you blink it’s briefly night, and when you blink again it’s morning. The sun is in the wrong place no matter where it is.

You grab the closest passerby. “Excuse me, do you know where this is?” You hold up the paper.

They don’t have a face. Not a horror-movie blur—just a smooth, polite nothing, like it’s been erased. Their voice comes from somewhere behind you.

“Of course,” they say. “It’s right where you left it.”

Then they keep walking and dissolve into a crowd.

Your heart starts ticking louder than your footsteps. You pick a direction and go.

---

The city rearranges itself as you move.

Skyscrapers fold inward like books closing. Streets bend at right angles that don’t exist in normal geometry. Every corner you turn, you’re sure you’ve been here before: the same café with the same red awning, the same chalkboard sign that reads:

**TODAY’S SPECIAL: SECOND CHANCES**

You push inside.

The bell above the door rings three times, even though it only moves once. The café is warm and bright and completely empty except for a barista whose back is turned. Jazz plays softly, but the saxophone keeps stopping to cough.

“Hi,” you say. “I’m lost. I have a meeting in an hour. Maybe less. I don’t even know where.”

The barista sets down a cup and turns around.

It’s you.

You, in the clothes you wore three years ago. Hair the way you used to wear it. Same tiny scar, same eyes—but their expression is quieter, like they already know how this ends.

“Rough day?” they ask.

You blink. “What is this?”

“This is where you always come when you’re late,” they say, sliding a coffee toward you. Your name is written on the cup in handwriting you recognize but can’t place. “You think you’re looking for an address. You’re not.”

Staring down, you see that instead of coffee, the surface of the drink shows a reflection—not of your face, but of the city outside, seen from very high up. Streets like veins. Tiny people like specks of dust moving around.

“I just need to know where to go,” you insist. “I really can’t miss this. It’s important.”

Your other self leans on the counter. “Then why did you dream about losing it?”

That word—*dream*—echoes in your chest like an elevator shaft. For a moment, things waver: the cup, the counter, the sound of the jazz. You remember, hazily, lying down somewhere else. A bed? A chair? You remember telling yourself, *I’ll deal with it tomorrow.*

“Tell me where the meeting is,” you say. “Please.”

Your other self sighs and reaches under the counter, pulling out a city map. It’s impossibly big, unfolding and unfolding until it spills across the floor, up the walls, over the ceiling. The café disappears behind it. You’re standing in a white space filled with nothing but map.

Every block has a label: **WHAT IF**, **LATER**, **NEVERMIND**, **TOO LATE**, **MAYBE SOMEDAY**.

You search for a street name that makes sense. Your finger skims over neighborhoods made of half-finished plans and half-written messages. There is no legend, no compass rose.

Then, in the very center of the map, you notice a single square of unprinted paper. No streets. No buildings. Just a small handwritten word:

**HERE**

“It’s there,” your other self says gently. “The meeting’s always there.”

You swallow. “How do I get to ‘Here’?”

The map rustles like leaves in a sudden wind. You feel a pressure behind your eyes, the way dreams sometimes push when they want you to wake up.

Your other self smiles, sad and kind. “You stop looking for shortcuts.”

They tap the blank square labeled *HERE*, and the paper goes translucent. Through it, you see a room: a simple table, two chairs. On the table, a stack of papers, a pen, a glass of water—ordinary, fluorescent light humming.

Your chest tightens. You know that room, somehow. It’s not in this strange city. It’s back where you’re supposed to be. Back where things actually happen.

“You’re going to be late if you keep running in circles,” your other self says. “You could stay here and keep trying to find the address. Or…”

“Or what?”

“Or you could just go sit down.”

You hesitate. “But I don’t know what I’m supposed to say, when I get there.”

“Neither do they,” your other self says. “That’s why it’s a meeting, not a script.”

The jazz starts again, louder—except it isn’t jazz anymore, it’s a ringtone you haven’t heard in years. The city-map crumples inward, shrinking, folding itself back into a tiny square of paper.

You’re back on the sidewalk. Cars moving in normal speed. People with faces, all of them busy, all of them headed somewhere they already understand. In your hand is the folded paper again. This time, when you open it, the words are different:

**MEETING: NOW**
**LOCATION: WHERE YOU ALREADY ARE**

Below that, in smaller letters:

**P.S. YOU’RE NOT LATE**

A strange calm washes over you. The panic doesn’t vanish, exactly, but it loses its claws. You look around at the city—still vast, still unfamiliar—but instead of trying to escape it, you just…stand there. You feel the ground under your feet. The weight of your body. Your own breathing.

Across the street, a glass building’s facade catches your reflection. For a moment, it looks like a boardroom table behind you, then a classroom, then a doctor’s office, then something you can’t quite name. Each version has you in it, sitting down, listening, speaking.

The meeting isn’t one thing. It’s all of them.

A bus passes, blocking your view, and when it’s gone the reflection is only you again, standing on the sidewalk.

You realize you’re not actually moving anymore. You don’t *need* to run. You don’t need the perfect directions plotted out in advance. You just have to decide to show up—for whatever this is, however it looks when you reach it.

The blank space on the paper labeled **HERE** starts to glow softly. The edges of the city blur. Colors bleed into each other like wet paint. Somewhere far away—or very close—someone shifts on a bed, fingers twitching, eyes about to open.

You take a breath like it’s the first one you’ve had all day.

“Okay,” you say to no one in particular, to the city, to yourself. “I’m here.”

The paper in your hand dissolves into light.

And then you wake up, with the puzzling, stubborn feeling that there *is* a meeting today…
…and this time, maybe, you’ll actually go.
