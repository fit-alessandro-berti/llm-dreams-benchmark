You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you accept their invitation with a mix of relief and hesitation. As they guide you through winding streets, you notice the buildings stretching impossibly tall, their windows glowing with warm, pulsing light.

The strangers begin to hum a melody you somehow recognize from childhood, though you can't place it. Their footsteps leave brief trails of luminescent blue that fade moments later. The city gradually transforms around you – concrete softens into mossy pathways, streetlights become towering trees with lanterns hanging from their branches.

\ shifting subtly each time you look away.

You arrive at a circular courtyard where dozens of people from different times in your life are gathered around a fountain that flows upward instead of down. They turn to you, smiling in recognition, including people you haven't met yet but somehow know.

You realize these strangers haven't just helped you find your way through the city – they've helped you find your way back to yourself. As you step toward the fountain, the water suspends in mid-air, forming a doorway of liquid light. Through it, you can see endless possibilities stretching before you.

You step through, feeling both the thrill of the unknown and the comfort of coming home.
