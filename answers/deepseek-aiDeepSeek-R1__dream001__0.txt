**Dream Continuation:**  

You start to sprint through winding alleys, your breath quickening as neon signs flicker in languages you can’t decipher. The city pulses like a living thing—skyscrapers tilt at impossible angles, their windows reflecting fragmented glimpses of your face. A clock tower chimes, but the hands spin backward. Panic rises, until a stray cat darts across your path, its tail hooked toward an alley strung with paper lanterns.  

You follow, compelled. The air grows thick with the scent of jasmine, and the cobblestones shift underfoot, guiding you to a courtyard where a fountain bubbles with ink. A woman in a cobalt coat offers you a folded map—except it’s blank. “You already know,” she murmurs, vanishing.  

Desperate, you press your palm to the page. Lines ignite like circuitry, revealing a path through a cathedral-sized bookstore. Shelves rearrange as you run, titles whispering clues: *”Trust the detour,” “Bridges are built mid-air.”*  

You burst onto a rooftop where the meeting is underway—attended by shadow figures with glowing eyes. The agenda? A single question etched in starlight: *”What are you racing toward?”* Before you answer, the city dissolves into a chorus of wingbeats. You wake, the echo of your own voice hanging: *“Enough.”*

**Symbolic Threads:** The dream mirrors anxiety around unpreparedness and external validation, resolving not in the “meeting” itself, but in the subconscious urging self-trust. The shifting city and ink fountain symbolize intuition, while the feline guide and blank map hint at self-reliance. The finale—a question posed by the protagonist’s own psyche—suggests liberation from performative urgency.
