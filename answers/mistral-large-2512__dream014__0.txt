**The Dream Continues…**

You hesitate for a moment—trust doesn’t come easily in this city of flickering neon and hurried footsteps—but their eyes are warm, their voices steady. One of them, a woman with a scarf the color of twilight, presses a small, worn map into your hands. *"We’ve all been lost here before,"* she says. *"But no one stays lost forever."*

The group leads you through winding alleys where the air hums with the scent of rain on pavement and distant music. The city, once overwhelming, now feels like a maze with hidden doors. A man with a guitar slung over his shoulder starts to play—a melody that tugs at something deep in your chest. Others join in, humming or clapping, and suddenly, the weight in your chest lightens.

Then, the woman with the scarf points to a narrow staircase leading up to a rooftop. *"There,"* she says. *"That’s where you’ll find what you’re looking for."* You climb, heart pounding, and when you reach the top, the city sprawls beneath you—endless, but no longer suffocating. The sky is painted in hues of violet and gold, and for the first time in what feels like forever, you *see* it: a path forward, not as a straight line, but as a constellation of possibilities.

One of the strangers hands you a single key. *"For when you’re ready,"* they say. You don’t ask what it opens. You just know.

And then—you wake up.

But the key is still in your palm. And the city? It’s waiting.
