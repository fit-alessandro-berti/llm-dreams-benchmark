### You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need **to survive and understand your new reality.**

---

The world around you is strange yet intoxicatingly vivid. The sky is a deeper blue than you’ve ever seen, unpolluted and endless. The air smells of earth, smoke, and something sweet you can’t quite name. There are no wires, no cars, no flickering screens—just the natural rhythm of wind, birds, and distant voices you can’t yet identify.

You glance down at your hands. They look the same, yet somehow rougher, as if you’ve been sleeping on hard ground for days. Your clothes feel unfamiliar—coarser fabric, simple cuts. You check for your phone. Nothing. No pocket, no bag—just bare skin and a faint ache in your head, like you’ve been jolted awake from a long, dreamless sleep.

As you stand, you notice the ground: dirt paths winding between sturdy, wooden structures made of timber and thatch. People in simple garments pass by, speaking in a language that sounds melodic but unintelligible. They glance at you with curious, cautious eyes. Some whisper. Others move on, going about their day—women carrying baskets, men hauling tools, children laughing and chasing each other through the alleyways.

You realize you’re in **a world without modern technology**—no electricity, no internet, no cars or machines. Just life as it might have been centuries ago. Perhaps medieval times? Or even earlier?

### **You need to:**

## **1. Find Shelter and Safety**

The sun is already climbing high, and you can feel its warmth on your skin. Nightfall will come, and you have no idea what creatures might roam when the sun sets. You spot a small, weathered barn a short distance away, half-hidden behind a thicket. It looks abandoned—but could it offer protection? You’ll need to check for usable materials, or perhaps find a better option: a nearby cottage with its door slightly ajar, smoke rising from the chimney.

## **2. Secure Food and Water**

Your stomach growes. You haven’t eaten since—well, since you fell asleep in your own bed, presumably in the 21st century. You spot a garden nearby with vegetables you don’t recognize but that look edible—roots, greens, maybe even fruit. There’s also a stream nearby, but is it safe to drink? You’ll need to find a way to purify it or risk illness.

## **3. Communicate and Understand Your Era**

The people here don’t speak your language. Or rather, you don’t speak theirs. You try repeating words, gesturing, mimicking their actions. One older man pauses, studies you, then points to his mouth and makes a drinking motion. You nod, mimic. He smiles slightly and gestures toward the stream. Maybe he’s trying to help.

You’ll need to **learn their language or find someone who can bridge the gap.** Perhaps there’s a scholar, a healer, or a traveler who has seen more of the world than this village.

## **4. Discover How You Got Here—and If You Can Return**

You feel a strange pull in your chest, like a memory just out of reach. Was this a dream? A transport? A spell? You notice a **strange mark** on your wrist—a faint shimmer, like a scar that glows in the sunlight. Could it be a clue? A key?

You’ll need to **explore, observe, and perhaps seek out others who might have seen strange things.** Maybe there are rumors of travelers vanishing, or folklore of time travelers, or perhaps even a local mystic who speaks of “the shifting veil.”

### **Your Next Move:**

As you stand at the edge of the village square, a group of children approach, giggling and pointing. One offers you a small, rough clay cup filled with water. You accept it, and as you drink, you feel a strange calmness settle over you—like the world is giving you a chance to begin anew.

**What will you do next?**

- 📖 **Explore the village and gather information from the locals?**  
- 🔍 **Investigate the glowing mark on your wrist?**  
- 🛠️ **Find materials to build or improve shelter?**
