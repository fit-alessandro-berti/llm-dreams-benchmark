...grasp the wheel, your knuckles white against the salt-slicked wood. The wind howls a dissonant chord, tearing at the sails, but as you stare into the eye of the swelling mountain of water ahead, you realize the ship isn’t made of timber and iron. It is made of your own memories, the hull built from old stories and the masts from the tall aspirations of your youth.

You raise your hand, not to signal a maneuver, but to catch the lightning. As the bolt strikes your palm, it doesn’t burn; it turns into a glowing compass that floats just above your skin. 

"Steady!" you roar, and your voice isn't just a sound—it’s a physical weight that anchors the deck, turning the chaotic waves into a staircase of glass. 

The crew—shadowy figures with familiar eyes—begin to sing a melody that matches the rhythm of the crashing sea. As the ship rises on the crest of a wave that touches the very hem of the clouds, the turbulence suddenly freezes. The spray turns into crystalline moths that flutter away into a sky that has transitioned from charcoal grey to a deep, shimmering violet.

You steer the ship not toward a shore, but upward, off the surface of the water and into the slipstream of the aurora borealis. The storm wasn't trying to sink you; it was trying to launch you. As you sail into the stars, the sound of the ocean fades into a profound, rhythmic silence, and you finally realize that you aren't just the captain—you are the wind that is filling the sails.
