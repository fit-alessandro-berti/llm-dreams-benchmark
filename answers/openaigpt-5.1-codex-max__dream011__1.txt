...wrong. Not wrong as in incorrectly printed, wrong as in they ripple on the page as if written on water, the ink alive, changing as you stare. The first one says, "Describe, in 500 words or less, the sound of a shadow." By the time you've read it twice the sentence has become, "Calculate the emotional weight of your grandfather's coat." Your pen feels heavy in your hand, or is it a pen? It looks like a pen but when you put it to paper it squelches like a brush loaded with paint, and the line it makes is not a line but a thread that wriggles off the page and crawls up your sleeve.

You look up to ask the invigilator a question and realize there is no invigilator; there is instead your third grade teacher, who is also somehow your dentist, her face flickering between freckles and a surgical mask, and she is whispering a lullaby in a language you almost remember. Everyone else around you is bent over their papers, but their hands are wrong too—some have claws, some have feathers, one desk is occupied by your childhood cat, diligently filling in bubble answers with her paw.

You tell yourself it's just a dream, just test anxiety, and then notice that you're not wearing any shoes. Your feet are planted in soft grass, although you're still in the fluorescent-lit classroom. The carpet is grass, the desks are tree stumps, the clock on the wall is a sun that ticks and ticks, too fast. When you look back at your exam, the questions have faded entirely. Blank. A hush goes through the room; you can hear the rustle of turning pages, the scratch of quills, the soft thump of your own heartbeat.

"Write your own," says a voice, not from any mouth you can see. It seems to come from the walls, from the sun-clock, from the roots under your feet. "Write your own career." The blank paper gleams, and for a moment you are filled with something like relief and something like terror. You lift your not-pen, which has turned into a feather, and when you touch it to the page the paper blooms outwards, like a white field sprouting words like flowers. Each word grows into a path.

You follow one with your eyes: "astronaut" blossoms into a rocket, which unfurls into a staircase that leads into the ceiling. "Baker" wafts the scent of bread into your face, the classroom filling with warm, yeasty fog. "Artist" drips colors down the walls. Your own name appears and disappears in looping cursive, spelled differently each time.

The clock-sun melts, dripping golden syrup that pools at your feet, sticking to your ankles. The other students are standing now, wading through honey, lifting their desks like rafts. The proctor/dentist/teacher hums louder. Your paper grows heavier, as if soaking up all these possibilities, your feather dissolving into it. The question—what do you want?—beats like another heart in your chest.

You press your palm to the page. It warms under your touch. Words spread from your skin, not ink but something like light, spelling out letters you didn't think you knew: D-R-E-A-M-E-R. The room breathes. The sun-clock lets out a long, contented sigh. Somewhere, an alarm begins to chirp, distant and insistent, cutting through the hum.

You blink, the honey evaporates, the grass becomes sheets, the desks vanish. Your bedroom ceiling greets you, familiar and bland. The alarm on your nightstand blinks 7:00 AM. Your heart is still racing, but your hand is open, empty, tingling, as if it has recently held a feather.
