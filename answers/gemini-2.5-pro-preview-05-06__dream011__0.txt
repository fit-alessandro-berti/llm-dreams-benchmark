...**completely blank.**

No, not just blank, but the paper itself seems to *absorb* light, a flat, matte blackness that gives me a weird sense of vertigo just looking at it. I blink, thinking my eyes are playing tricks. I look around. Everyone else is scribbling furiously, their pens scratching with an almost deafening intensity in the otherwise silent room.

I tentatively reach out and touch the paper. It feels... warm? And slightly yielding, like newly set tar. Panicked, I look at the invigilator, a stern-faced man I vaguely remember from the first lecture, who now seems to have an impossibly long neck, craning over the students like a curious giraffe.

He catches my eye and gives a slow, knowing nod, as if my blank paper is exactly what he expected.

I pick up my pen – a trusty BiC I’ve used all semester – but as I try to write my name, the ink just... vanishes. It doesn't bead or smear; it's simply *gone* the moment it touches the black surface. I try again, harder. Nothing.

Then, a single word shimmers into existence on the black paper, not in ink, but in faint, pulsing silver light:

**"Sing."**

Just that. Sing. About what? To whom? I glance around again. Is this a trick question? Are others getting actual questions about quantum physics or ancient philosophy, the supposed subjects of this course? A girl to my left is furiously drawing what looks like a detailed map of a city made entirely of cheese. The boy in front is sculpting something out of his exam paper, which has become pliable like clay in his hands.

The silver word "Sing" pulses brighter, then fades, replaced by a new one:

**"Remember."**

Remember what? My name? The quadratic formula? The taste of my grandmother's apple pie? The crushing weight of this exam, the one that determines my entire future, presses down on me. My heart hammers.

The word shifts again, this time more insistent, the light almost uncomfortably bright:

**"Feel."**

And suddenly, I *do* feel. I feel the smooth, cool plastic of the chair under me, the slightly stale air of the exam hall, the frantic thumping of my own pulse. And then, a wave of intense sadness washes over me for no reason I can pinpoint. Tears well in my eyes.

Is *this* the exam? To articulate these raw, unfiltered emotions? How do I even begin to write *that* down on a paper that won't take ink?

The owl-headed proctor (when did he become an owl?) hoots softly from the front of the room, its glowing yellow eyes fixed on me.

I look back at my paper. The word "Feel" is gone. Now, it just shows a swirling, hypnotic pattern, like a galaxy being born. I realize with a jolt that the exam isn't asking me questions *to* answer, but questions *to experience*.

And the clock on the wall is melting.
