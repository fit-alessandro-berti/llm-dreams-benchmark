**The Storm’s Edge**

The waves rise like monstrous fingers, clawing at the hull with a sound like grinding teeth. The wind howls through the rigging, a living thing that twists your voice into a guttural scream. Your crew—*your* crew—stands in a tight circle, their faces pale beneath the flickering lantern light. Some cling to the railings, their fingers white-knuckled. Others press their backs against the bulkheads, their breaths shallow. One of them, a young sailor with hands too small for the weight of the storm, presses a trembling hand to your shoulder. *"Captain, what do we do?"*

You swallow hard, the salt and fear coating your throat. The compass needle spins wildly, as if the very direction of the world has unraveled. You’ve spent years mastering the art of reading the sea, but tonight, the sea *reads* you back—with teeth.

*"We don’t fight it,"* you say, voice steady despite the tremor in your bones. *"We let it take us where it will."* The words feel hollow, but they’re the only anchor you have. You turn to the helm, gripping the wheel as if it’s the only thing keeping you from being swept away. The captain’s chair creaks under your weight, as if the ship itself is resisting your command.

Then—*a sound.*

Not the storm. Not the wind. Something else. A low, rhythmic *thump*, like a heartbeat. The crew stiffens. The young sailor’s eyes widen. You follow the sound, your pulse quickening, and your gaze locks onto the horizon—where the waves are *not* crashing. There, in the distance, a shape cuts through the black water: a single, ancient mast, its sails still unfurled, though the wind has failed it. A ship. *Not ours.*

And then—movement. A figure steps from the waves, silhouetted against the dying light of the storm. Tall, gaunt, their face obscured by a tattered cap. They raise a hand, and the sea *answers*—not with fury, but with something older. Something that makes the waves part like a curtain, revealing the depths beneath.

The captain’s voice, rough with something you’ve never heard before, cuts through the chaos: *"You’re not supposed to be here."*

The storm doesn’t end. It *changes.* The waves grow calmer, but the air hums with energy, thick and electric. The ship beneath you seems to *breathe*, as if it’s waiting. The figure on the horizon tilts their head, and the mast begins to sway—not with the wind, but with *intent*.

You look at your crew. At the young sailor, now gripping your arm. At the captain’s chair, which seems to be *pulling* you toward it. And then you remember: this isn’t just a storm. It’s a *test.*

And you realize—you’re not just the captain of this ship.

You’re the one who’s been waiting for this moment all along.
