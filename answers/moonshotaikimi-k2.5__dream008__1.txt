 ...and you reach for your keyboard, but your hands have turned into dictionaries, the pages riffling in a wind that isn't there. The deadline looms—not as a date on a calendar, but as a physical precipice at the edge of your desk, a sheer cliff dropping into infinite Monday mornings. Your boss is multiplying. There are three of them now, then seven, all drumming their fingers in rhythms that sync with your accelerating heartbeat.

The project specifications materialize as origami cranes that unfold into blank sheets, then fold back into question marks. You understand suddenly that you must compile every unspoken thought everyone in the building has ever had, format them in a shade of blue that doesn't exist yet, and have it delivered to a client who is, you realize with dream-certainty, a version of yourself from an alternate timeline where you took that job in Tokyo instead.

Time is doing that thing where it stretches like taffy. Five minutes feels like five hours feels like five seconds. The office walls breathe—in and out, in and out—and with each exhale, the ceiling drops an inch lower. Your boss (the primary one, who now has the face of your childhood dentist) is handing you tools that make no sense: a spoon for measuring data, a length of shadow to tie the spreadsheets together, a jar labeled "URGENT" that contains only the sound of distant thunder.

You begin to work, because in dreams, you always do. The task is impossible, yes, but also inevitable. You are knitting fog into a sweater. You are filing clouds into the cabinet drawers that have always been there, haven't they? The deadline approaches, not with menace, but with a strange, heavy gravity, pulling at your ribcage like the moon pulls tides.

And just as you are about to—just as the final piece clicks into place or crumbles into dust (the outcome is both, simultaneously)—the floor becomes liquid and you begin to sink, not falling but dissolving, into the carpet pattern, which is actually a map, which is actually the project itself, which is actually just the inside of your own eyelids, fluttering, fluttering, waiting for the next scene to load...
