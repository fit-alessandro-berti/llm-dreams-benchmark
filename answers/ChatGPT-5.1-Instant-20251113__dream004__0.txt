…and you feel an odd pull toward it, as if the canvas is aware of your presence. The shifting colors around you pause—just for a heartbeat—as though the whole world is holding its breath.

A brush materializes in your hand, weightless but warm, like it’s alive. When you touch the canvas, the bristles don’t lay down paint. Instead, they draw *possibilities*. The moment the tip makes contact, the blank surface ripples like water, and an image begins to rise from beneath it.

At first, it looks like a doorway. Not painted, but real—its frame made of drifting lines, its colors folding into each other like liquid stained glass. Beyond it, you glimpse something familiar, though you can’t place why: the gentle outline of a place you’ve long forgotten or have yet to visit.

A whisper curls across your mind, though there is no speaker.

**“What you create becomes your path.”**

The brush moves on its own, guided by something within you rather than your hand. The doorway grows sharper, clearer. You sense that stepping through it will change the dream… maybe even change *you*.

Behind you, the shifting world stirs again—colors swirl faster, shapes lean toward the canvas, watching.

The doorway hums softly, waiting.

Do you step through?
