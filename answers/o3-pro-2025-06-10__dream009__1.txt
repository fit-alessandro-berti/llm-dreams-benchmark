…survive long enough to work out where—​and when—​you are, and how you might get home. 

You pull the rough wool blanket tighter around your shoulders and take stock of what you can see from the rise where you woke: a river like a silver ribbon, plumes of wood-smoke curling above a thatch-roofed village, and beyond it miles of dense, shadow-striped forest. No roads, no power lines, no hum of engines—​only the wind in the grass and a distant clatter of wagon wheels.

Step one: blend in.

You descend toward the village, practicing the few Middle-English words you remember from high-school Chaucer. At the edge of the first field you pass a boy herding geese. He eyes your strange clothes—​T-shirt, jeans, sneakers—​like they’re royal regalia. You mime shivering and point to his cloak. He hesitates, then offers it, clearly expecting payment. You slide your watch from your wrist. It’s dead weight here anyway. The boy’s eyes widen at the glittering metal; deal struck. You wrap yourself in the coarse cloak, push your sleeves up to hide the printed fabric, and trudge on.

Step two: food and information.

Inside the village alehouse the air is thick with peat smoke, sweat, and roasted onions. Coins here are hammered silver pennies, so you trade again—​this time the key-ring flashlight on your belt. The tavern-keeper snaps it on, gasps at the narrow beam, and offers you a trencher of stew and a seat by the hearth. Between mouthfuls you listen. The talk is of an eclipse seven nights hence—​an omen, the priest says, that “the wanderer will open the sky.” The locals spit, make the sign of the cross, and stare at you when they think you’re not looking.

Step three: find a way home.

A traveling scholar, Brother Owain, takes interest in your strange questions about astronomy and “celestial mechanisms.” When you sketch a crude diagram of gears—​a pocket-watch without the case—​his eyes glitter. He invites you to the monastery scriptorium, where, he says, there is an “ancient brass engine” fished from a shipwreck; no one can make it turn. Your heart jolts—​could it be some proto-clock, even an analogue to the Antikythera device? Something sophisticated enough to misplace you in time?

That night, by rush-light, you examine the corroded gears. The craftsmanship is centuries beyond everything else in the room—​except, maddeningly, for one missing cog. You trace the empty gap with your fingertip and remember the ridged crown of the flashlight you traded away. Same diameter, same tooth pattern. The eclipse in seven days, the prophecy about a wanderer opening the sky—​it’s not superstition; it’s instructions.

Step four: reclaim the cog.

At dawn you’re back at the tavern. The keeper is reluctant, but silver speaks, and soon the flashlight lies in pieces on the table. You pocket the crown, polish it with your sleeve, and hurry to the monastery. Brother Owain watches, breath held, as you fit the cog into place. The wheels catch, spin, then align with a soft, decisive click. At that moment the world seems to tilt; dust motes freeze mid-air like constellations.

Outside, bells peal in alarm—​the eclipse has begun early, blotting out the sun days before expected. In the spreading twilight, villagers kneel, and Owain whispers, “You have opened the sky.”

The brass engine hums, growing warm in your hands. The gears whirl faster, faster, until light pours from every seam—​white, searing, impossible. Instinctively you close your eyes—

—​and wake to the shrill ring of your phone alarm, tangled in modern sheets, city traffic droning outside. On your nightstand: watch, keys—​and a small, corroded brass cog, warm to the touch, as though it had just been turning.
