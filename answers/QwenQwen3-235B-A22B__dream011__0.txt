**Continuation of the Dream:**  

You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are **written in a language you’ve never seen before**—a swirling mix of symbols, ancient glyphs, and faint whispers that seem to emanate from the paper itself. Your pencil trembles as you try to focus, but the text shifts like liquid, morphing into equations that unravel the laws of physics, followed by essay prompts that ask you to defend decisions you’ve never made: *“Justify your betrayal of the person you love most. Use three examples from your childhood.”*  

The room grows colder. The clock above ticks backward, its hands dripping black ink onto your desk. You glance around—other students are scribbling furiously, but their pens bleed through the pages, leaving stains that pool into recognizable faces: your mentors, your rivals, your younger self. When you try to answer, your pencil snaps, and the lead spills out like a live wire, coiling into a serpent that hisses, *“You’re unprepared. You’ve always been unprepared.”*  

Suddenly, the proctor looms over you—a figure with your own face, aged and weary. They flip your test to the last page, where a final question glows: *“What if you’ve already failed?”* The walls begin to close in, the ceiling crumbling into sand. You wake up gasping, your heart pounding, only to realize—the exam never ended. It’s still happening, right now, in the waking world.  

**Dream logic twist:** The test isn’t about knowledge. It’s about how you confront the unknown. And the clock is still ticking.
