the air tightens around you, like a held breath. The light goes thin — green turning to pewter — and the chorus of birds falls silent all at once. A wind comes that knows your name: it moves through the ferns and up the trunks, lifting motes of pollen so they spin like tiny lanterns. You can feel the electricity on your skin, a tingling that makes your hair stand up. Somewhere beyond the trees a low drum begins, not just thunder but the sound of something waking.

Branches bend away from an invisible center and the path under your feet tilts as if the earth itself is turning. Rain begins, not as drops but as a spray of cold bright beads that scatter like thrown glass. Each bead, when it touches you, opens a memory — a laugh in another country, the smell of your grandmother’s kitchen, a phrase you once loved and forgot — and for a dizzy moment your whole life unfolds in the space between two breaths. The storm is not only weather; it is a sift, shaking loose what you’ve carried for years. Where lightning forks, the trees peel back like curtains and you catch a glimpse of something impossible: a sea filling the valley, or a city of candles floating in the clouds — some other world that has always been walking beside this one.

You do not run. There is a curiosity in you now, steady as a compass, and you step toward the closest tree. Its bark is warm, humming with the storm’s rhythm. When you press your palm to it, the wind answers in a voice you recognize as your own, and all the scattered memories knit themselves into a single thread. The storm does not destroy; it clarifies, washing the veins of the forest until the colors are brighter than they were before. Rain softens into a fine, luminous mist. The distant thunder becomes applause. You stand there, soaked and laughing, and know two things with absolute certainty: whatever the storm took, it was ready to be given up, and whatever it leaves behind will grow taller than it did before. Then, as if invited, you keep walking — lighter, older, and utterly awake within the dream.
