walk away before things escalate further. As you turn to leave, the room around you begins to shimmer and distort, as if reality itself is bending. The walls ripple like water, and the air hums with an unfamiliar energy. Your friend’s voice fades into static, and suddenly, you’re standing in a vast, empty field under a sky streaked with colors you’ve never seen before.

The ground beneath your feet feels soft yet solid, like walking on a cloud. In the distance, a towering figure—neither human nor animal—watches you with eyes that glow like distant stars. It doesn’t speak, but you *understand* it somehow. It’s asking you a question, though you can’t quite grasp the words. The question lingers in your mind like a half-remembered melody.

You take a step forward, and the field dissolves into a labyrinth of mirrors. Each reflection shows a different version of yourself—some laughing, some crying, some standing in places you’ve never been. One mirror shows you and your friend, but this time, you’re both smiling, the argument forgotten. Another shows you alone, older, wiser, holding something small and glowing in your hands.

The towering figure is still there, now standing beside you. It gestures toward the mirrors, and you realize it’s not just showing you possibilities—it’s asking you to *choose*. But before you can decide, the dream shifts again. The mirrors shatter, and you’re falling, falling—

Then you wake up, heart pounding, the argument still fresh in your mind. But now, there’s a strange warmth in your pocket. You reach in and pull out a small, smooth stone that wasn’t there before. It hums faintly when you touch it.

What do you do next?
