...a blank canvas and a paintbrush that hovers beside it, dipped in a liquid that shifts from deep indigo to molten gold. You don't remember picking it up, but suddenly it's in your hand, warm and humming like a plucked string.  

You touch the brush to the canvas. Instead of paint, a *sound* spills out드 clear, silver chime드nd where the bristles meet the surface, a shape blooms: not a drawing, but a *feeling* given form. Warmth, like sunlight on skin, spreads outward as a rippling circle of amber light.  

As you step back, the canvas doesn't stay flat. The painted warmth *peels* away from the surface, billowing like fabric in a slow wind, and solidifies into a doorway드n archway framed in living flame that doesn't burn. Through it, the shifting landscape changes: now you see a forest, but the trees are made of stained glass, their leaves chiming like bells when the wind moves them. Rivers of liquid light flow uphill, and gravity feels optional.  

A voice, familiar yet formless, whispers at the edge of hearing: *"Add your shade. The world listens."*  

The paintbrush trembles in your hand, now dripping with a color you've never seen드 hue that smells like rain and tastes like forgotten memories. You realize: anything you paint here doesn't just appear. It *becomes*.  

So you lift the brush again... but what do you create? A bridge? A bird? A new rule for the sky?  

*(The dream waits for your next move.)*
