You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to run, but the streets twist and shift beneath your feet like a living puzzle. Neon signs flicker with names written in a language you can’t decipher. A clock tower looms in the distance, its hands spinning backward.  

A figure materializes beside you—a stranger in a trench coat, holding an old pocket watch. They hand it to you without speaking. The watch face is blank except for a single glowing arrow pointing toward a labyrinth of alleyways. You follow it, the air growing colder with every step.  

 suddenly, the ground splits open, revealing a subway entrance. Inside, the walls pulse with bioluminescent vines. A train arrives silently, its doors hissing. The car is empty except for a mirror on every seat. Each reflection shows a different version of yourself: one smiling, another frowning, another not there at all.  

You choose a seat. The train lurches forward, and the city blurs into a kaleidoscope of light. The pocket watch vibrates. You open it again—now the arrow is gone, replaced by a single word: *“Nowhere.”*  

The train screeches to a halt. The doors open to a doorless room. A voice echoes, *“The meeting is the seeking.”*  

You wake up, clutching the sheets, the taste of iron on your tongue, and the faint hum of the clock tower still in your ears.
