...and each group seems to speak a language just slightly out of reach—familiar enough to almost understand, but slipping away like smoke the moment you try to grasp it. Laughter rings out in rhythms that echo childhood memories, yet the words themselves dissolve before they reach your ears.

You weave through clusters of elegantly dressed strangers, their faces shimmering as if seen through heat haze. Some wear masks made of porcelain, others of living flowers that bloom and wilt with their expressions. A woman offers you a glass of something that glows faintly blue, whispering, “For courage,” but when you look down, the glass is empty.

At the far end of the room—vast as a ballroom but shifting like a labyrinth—you spot your friend. They’re standing near a grand piano that plays itself, notes floating visibly in the air like fireflies. Relief floods you, but as you hurry forward, the floor tilts gently beneath your feet. The space stretches, and your friend drifts farther away, their mouth moving as if calling your name, yet no sound arrives.

Suddenly, the music swells into a familiar tune—one you haven’t heard since you were ten—and the crowd parts like a curtain. For a heartbeat, everything is clear: the scent of rain, the warmth of your friend’s smile, the certainty that if you just reach them, you’ll remember why you came here.

But then the lights dim, and someone brushes your shoulder with fingers cold as winter branches. You turn—and wake up.  

The last note of the piano lingers in your ears.  
And on your nightstand?  
A single, wilted petal you’ve never seen before.
