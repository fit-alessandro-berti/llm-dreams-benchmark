...find a way to communicate with the people here. Your voice feels foreign in your throat—your words, your accent, even your breath, carry the weight of a past life. The air is thick with the scent of woodsmoke, damp earth, and something ancient—like old parchment and iron. 

You stand at the edge of a bustling village nestled in the shadow of a massive, moss-covered stone circle—hundreds of standing stones, worn smooth by centuries, their inscriptions fading into myth. No roads, just rutted paths of packed dirt and gravel. People move with purpose: women grinding grain in stone mortars, men mending nets, children chasing goats through fields of barley. They wear wool, linen, leather—simple, practical, made by hand.

You realize you are standing in a field, barefoot and in a torn modern shirt, your watch long gone. Your phone? A myth. Your computer? A legend. 

But then—*a child stops, eyes wide, staring at you*. Not in fear. In wonder. 

And from behind her, an old woman steps forward, her face a map of wrinkles, one hand on a walking staff of ash wood. She speaks in a language you don’t know—yet somehow, your mind *understands* it. Not through translation, but through a strange, tingling resonance deep in your bones.

*“You are not of this time,”* she says. *“But your eyes… they have seen the future. The fire in them says you know things we cannot yet name.”*

You open your mouth to speak—but only a whisper escapes. The air hums.

Then, realization: you weren’t *transported*.

You were *remembered*.  

And the circle isn’t just a monument—it’s a doorway. One that only awakens when someone *from the future* steps into it… and *needs to be found*. 

Now, you must decide:  
Will you try to understand this world—learn their language, their rhythms, their stories?  
Or do you search for the next sign, the next stone that whispers *what comes next*?

Because the dream isn’t just a place.  
It’s a question—*asking you to remember who you were… and who you’re meant to become.*
