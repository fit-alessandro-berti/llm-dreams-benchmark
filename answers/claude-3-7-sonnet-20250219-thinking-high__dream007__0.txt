# Dream Continuation

You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to step away from the conversation before saying something you'll regret. 

\ toward the door. As you step outside, the world shifts subtly around you. The sky is an unusual shade of purple-blue, and the street seems longer than you remember.

You walk for what feels like minutes but could be hours, the rhythm of your footsteps gradually calming your mind. When you look up, you're standing before a small bridge crossing a stream you don't recall ever seeing before. On the bridge stands an elderly person with familiar eyes—somehow they remind you of your friend, though they're clearly someone else.

\ we carry are the words we never say,\

Suddenly, you understand the real source of your argument. It wasn't about what you were discussing at all, but about a deeper fear—of losing connection, of not being understood, of past wounds reopening.

When you turn to go back, you're instantly at your friend's door. You knock, and when they answer, words flow between you like water—honest, clear, and healing. As you reach an understanding, the room fills with a warm golden light that seems to emanate from the space between you.

You wake feeling strangely peaceful, with the lingering sense that something important has been resolved.
