...realize the walls are made of shifting mathematical equations, their numbers glowing softly and rearranging themselves as I watch. As I move deeper into the maze, I notice my own thoughts becoming visible - appearing as luminous threads in the air, connecting puzzle pieces across impossible distances.

A door appears that can only be opened by solving three riddles simultaneously, but somehow I find I can split my consciousness into multiple perspectives. Time moves differently here; I spend what feels like hours on a single puzzle, yet my shadow hasn't moved.

In the center chamber, I discover the final puzzle is simply a mirror. But when I look into it, I see myself solving puzzles I haven't encountered yet, in rooms I've never entered. The reflection smiles and writes a single equation in condensed breath on the glass: âˆž = 1.

Suddenly I understand - the maze isn't meant to be solved, it's meant to be dissolved. The walls begin melting into pure light, and I realize I'm not trapped in the maze... I *am* the maze, dreaming myself into existence, each puzzle a neuron firing in some vast, incomprehensible mind.

I wake up. Or do I step through the mirror? In dreams, perhaps they're the same thing.
