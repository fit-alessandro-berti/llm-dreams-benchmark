run, your heart pounding in your chest as the towering, labyrinthine buildings seem to shift and warp around you. The streets twist like living things, alleys appearing and disappearing in the corners of your vision. Every sign is written in a script you almost recognize—letters that flicker between familiar and alien, as if the language itself is breathing.

A stranger in a long, tattered coat brushes past you, whispering, *"The Clocktower doesn’t wait for anyone."* You spin around, but they’re already gone, dissolved into the crowd of faceless figures hurrying in every direction. Then you see it: a distant spire piercing the smog-choked sky, its gears grinding audibly even from here. The Clocktower. Of course—that’s where the meeting must be. But how do you get there?

You flag down a rickshaw pulled by a skeletal horse with eyes like smoldering coals. The driver, a woman with a porcelain mask cracked down one side, tilts her head. *"Tick-tock,"* she rasps. *"The bridges are rising."* Sure enough, the cobblestone path ahead splits open as a massive drawbridge groans upward, revealing a black canal beneath. The water isn’t water—it’s thick, slow-moving ink, and something *moves* just below the surface.

Panic claws at your throat. You leap onto the bridge’s edge as it lifts, clinging to the rusted chains. Below, the ink swirls into shapes—hands, faces, a gaping mouth whispering your name. The driver’s laughter echoes: *"Shortcut’s that way, if you’re brave."* She points to a narrow fire escape clinging to a building that wasn’t there a second ago.

You climb, your fingers slipping on wet metal. The city breathes around you—windows flicker with scenes from your past, doors slam shut just as you reach for them. At the top, you burst onto a rooftop garden where time itself seems to stutter. The Clocktower looms directly ahead, its face showing *two different times at once*. One hand points to your meeting hour; the other spins wildly backward.

A figure stands in the doorway—a version of *you*, but older, wearing the same clothes, their face half-shadowed. *"You’re late,"* they say, smiling sadly. *"You always are."* They extend a hand. *"But the meeting isn’t what you think. Come see."*

Behind them, the tower’s interior isn’t a conference room—it’s a vast, circular library where every book is titled with a date, and the pages rewrite themselves in real time. Your double flips open a volume labeled *Today* and taps a line: *"The meeting was never the point. The city is the test."*

You wake up—
—gasping, your alarm blaring, the time on your phone reading *exactly* the hour the dream-meeting was supposed to start. And scrawled on your notepad, in handwriting you don’t recognize:
**"Next time, take the boat."**
