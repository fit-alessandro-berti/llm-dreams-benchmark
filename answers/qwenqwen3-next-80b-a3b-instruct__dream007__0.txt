You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to stop shouting.

Not because you’ve lost steam—but because suddenly, the air around you shifts. The walls of the room dissolve into paper-thin mist, and the voices of everyone else in the dream—friends, strangers, even your own thoughts—fade into the hush of a waking lullaby. Your friend’s face, flushed and furious just moments ago, softens. Their eyes, wide with accusation, now shimmer with something older… something wounded.

And then they whisper—not angry, not defensive—just tender:

> “Do you remember the treehouse?”

You freeze.

Of course you remember. The crooked oak in your grandmother’s backyard. The one we built with broken nails and duct tape when we were twelve. We swore we’d live there forever. You were the architect. I was the rope-binder. We didn’t have a roof—just a tarp and stars.

“I left it.” You say it before you realize you’re speaking aloud. “I didn’t say goodbye. I just... stopped coming.”

Your friend nods slowly. A single tear falls—and turns into a firefly as it hits the ground.

“You were scared,” they say. “Scared I’d be mad. Scared you’d be a disappointment. But you never asked.”

The word “disappointment” hangs like smoke—and the dream doesn’t let you look away. Because now, the treehouse is there again, glowing faintly in the distance, lit by moonlight and fireflies. And in the window, propped against the splintered sill, is a folded piece of notebook paper. The one you wrote on the night you ran away. You never mailed it. You never dared.

You walk toward it.

As you reach out—your friend doesn’t follow.

They already know.

You unfold the paper.

It’s blank.

But when you hold it to the moonlight—words bloom slowly, like ink blooming in water:

> *“I thought I had to win the argument to be worthy of your love.  
> I was wrong.  
> Can we just sit in the treehouse again?  
> I brought the tarp.  
> You bring the stars?”*

You look up.

Your friend is smiling now—not with forgiveness, but with the quiet certainty of a bond that never broke.

And then—you wake.

Not with a gasp.

But with a hand reaching instinctively for your phone.

To text them.

Just one sentence:

> *“Remember the treehouse?”*

And deep in your chest—the silence feels like home.
