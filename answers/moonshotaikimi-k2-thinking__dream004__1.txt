...the canvas begins to breathe. Not with lungs, but with ripples that spread from its center like stones dropped in reverse gravity. The blankness isn't empty—it's *charged*, a pregnant white that hums with the color of silence.

I reach out, and my fingers pass through the surface. Not canvas but membrane. The world around me—those melting geometries, those singing shades of impossible hues—suddenly *whoosh* into my arm, racing through my veins like liquid lightning. The canvas is *drinking* the chaos, siphoning it from the air, from my skin, from the spaces between thoughts.

Shapes begin to *push* from the other side. A corner of something that cannot exist in three dimensions pokes through, folding the canvas into a shape that hurts to look at—a seven-dimensional origami of maybe. I try to pull my hand back, but the canvas has become hungry, and my fingerprints are now swirling galaxies that spill onto its surface.

The blankness is gone. In its place, I see the dream from the outside: myself, standing here, watching myself paint with colors that haven't been invented yet. The brush is made of my own attention, each stroke a decision I haven't made but will remember tomorrow as a vague feeling of loss.

And the painting—I understand now that it *is* the world. The shifting landscape isn't a place; it's a work in progress. I am both the viewer and the pigment, both the dreamer and the dreamed.

The canvas stretches wider, becomes thin as glass, then as thin as a promise. I could step through. I *am* stepping through. The blank space was never asking to be filled.

It was asking to be *crossed*.
