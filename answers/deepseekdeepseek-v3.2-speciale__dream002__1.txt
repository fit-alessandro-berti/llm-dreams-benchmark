You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the sky turns an eerie shade of green, as if the world has been inverted. The wind howls through the trees, bending their branches into impossible angles. Lightning cracks overhead, and in the brilliant flash, the forest transforms: the trees become towering figures with glowing eyes, and the ground beneath your feet softens into a thick, swirling mist. Rain begins to fall, but each drop is a tiny prism of light that shimmers and dances around you. You try to run, but your legs move in slow motion, and with each step the forest recedes, replaced by a vast, empty desert under a blood-red sky. The storm fades into a distant rumble, leaving you standing alone in the silence, wondering if you ever left the dream at all.
