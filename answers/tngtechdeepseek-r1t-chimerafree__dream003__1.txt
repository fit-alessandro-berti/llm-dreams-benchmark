**Dream Continuation:**

As your fingers brush against the intricate patterns, they begin to glow faintly, pulsating like a heartbeat. The symbols—now alive with light—shift and swirl, rearranging into a constellation you somehow recognize. A soft melody hums from within the box, echoing a forgotten lullaby. 

With each note, the lid trembles. Suddenly, the patterns lock into place, forming a shimmering keyhole. A beam of light shoots upward, projecting a hologram of a winding path through a forest, ending at a door-shaped shadow. The box clicks open, revealing not an object, but a whisper: *"The answer is in the journey."* 

You wake with a start, the dream slipping away—but the warmth of the box lingers, as if it’s still in your hands.
