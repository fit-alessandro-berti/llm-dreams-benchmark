Of course. The dream continues...

...you realize you need to find clean water. The thought arrives not as a gentle reminder but as a primal, gnawing certainty. The air is clean, filled with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, but your throat is parched.

You stumble upon a dirt path, worn deep into the ground by generations of footsteps. Following it, you crest a small hill and see a village below. It’s a cluster of thatch-roofed cottages huddled around a central green. There are no wires, no poles, no hum of electricity—just the lowing of an ox from a distant field and the crack of an axe splitting wood.

As you approach, a woman in a coarse woolen dress steps out of a doorway, a wooden bucket in her hand. She freezes, her eyes widening at the sight of you. Your strange clothes, your haircut, the very way you carry yourself—everything marks you as an outsider.

You raise your empty hands, a universal gesture of peace. "Hello?" you say, your voice hoarse. "I... I need water. Please."

She doesn't understand the words, but she understands the desperation in your eyes and the way you gesture to your mouth. Her suspicion softens into cautious pity. She points towards the center of the village, then gestures for you to follow.

She leads you to the village well, a simple stone circle with a wooden bucket and rope. A few other villagers gather, murmuring to each other, their faces a mixture of curiosity and unease. A man with a leather apron, perhaps the blacksmith, stands with his thick arms crossed, watching you intently.

The woman draws a bucket of water. It’s cool and clear. She offers you a ladle carved from a gourd. You drink greedily, the water tasting more pure and revitalizing than anything you've ever had. The immediate crisis is solved, but a far greater one looms.

The blacksmith speaks, his voice a low rumble. He points at you, then at the lord's manor house on a hill overlooking the village, then makes a locking gesture. The message is clear: a stranger is a threat, and you will be taken to the authorities.

The woman who helped you looks nervously from you to the blacksmith. She quickly gestures for you to wait, then ducks into her cottage. She returns with a rough-spun cloak and a crust of dark bread, pressing them into your hands. She points urgently towards the dense forest at the edge of the fields, then makes a shooing motion.

She isn't just giving you charity; she's giving you a chance.

You clutch the cloak and bread, your heart hammering. You have a Choice. Do you:

**A) Take her offer.** Mumble a thanks she can't understand, pull the cloak over your strange clothes, and run for the tree line, embracing the unknown dangers of the wilderness to avoid the certain imprisonment of the manor.

**B) Stand your ground.** You don't know the language, but you have a modern mind. You point to the blacksmith's tools, then to yourself, and mime building, fixing, creating. You try to show you can be useful, that you're not a threat, and take your chances with the village lord.

The dream holds here, the path splitting in two, waiting for you to choose.
