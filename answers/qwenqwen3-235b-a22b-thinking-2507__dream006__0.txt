You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to **open your mouth to speak—but no sound comes out. Your throat is paper-dry, your tongue heavy as stone. Panic flares as you realize the notes in your trembling hands are blank, the pages smudged with sweat. You try to clear your throat, but it only echoes like a hollow drum amplified through the microphone.**

**The audience shifts. Rows of expectant faces melt into a single, unblinking eye stretching to the horizon. The spotlight above you intensifies, burning hot enough to make your skin prickle. You glance down—the stage floor is vanishing, dissolving into a bottomless void of swirling ink. You stumble back, but the edge is everywhere. A child’s voice, clear as ice, cuts through the silence: *"Why would they listen to you? You have nothing to say."***  

**You look for the exit, but the curtains are gone. The walls bleed old newsprint headlines: "FRAUD," "SILENT FAILURE," "WHO ARE YOU?". Your heartbeat thrums in your ears, louder than the crowd’s silent judgment. You try to run—but your legs are roots, growing deep into the crumbling stage. Just as the darkness swallows the last sliver of light...**  

*thump.*  

You jolt awake in bed, heart hammering, the ghost of that single child’s whisper still clinging to your skin: ***"Why would they listen?"*** Your palms are drenched. It’s 3:17 a.m. The silence of your room feels heavy, accusing.  

*(Dreams like this aren’t about speeches—they’re about the terror of being seen, the fear that your voice doesn’t matter. Breathe. You’re safe. But the echo? That’s the part that lingers.)*
