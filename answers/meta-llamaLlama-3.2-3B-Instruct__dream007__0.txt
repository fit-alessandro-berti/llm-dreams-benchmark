...take a deep breath and suggest we take a break and get some fresh air. We step outside to the quiet patio, and I gesture for my friend to sit down at a small wooden table. I join them, and we sit in silence for a moment, letting the sounds of the city fade away.

As we sit there, I notice a small hummingbird flitting around the colorful flowers in a nearby planter. It's a gentle, soothing sight, and I feel my friend's tense muscles relax slightly as they watch it too.

"Hey," I say softly, breaking the silence. "Can we just... stop for a minute? We're both getting worked up, and I think we need to calm down before we start yelling at each other."

My friend looks at me, and for a moment, I think they're going to argue some more. But then they take a deep breath, just like I did, and nod slowly.

"Okay," they say, their voice barely above a whisper. "Let's do that."

We sit in silence for a few more minutes, watching the hummingbird and listening to the sound of our own heartbeat. As we sit there, I notice that my friend's expression is changing – they're starting to relax, and their eyes are losing some of their intensity.

I take another deep breath, and then I start to talk. "I think what I'm really worried about is... I think we're talking about the wrong thing. I know we both care deeply about this, but I feel like we're missing the bigger picture. Can we start again, from the beginning, and try to focus on what's really important here?"

My friend looks at me, and I can see the gears turning in their mind. Then, slowly, they start to nod, and we begin to rehash the argument, but this time, it's with a sense of calm and clarity.

As we talk, the hummingbird flies closer, and we watch it together, mesmerized by its tiny wings and bright colors. The argument becomes a gentle, meandering conversation, and before we know it, the sun is starting to set, casting a warm golden light over the city.

As we sit there, feeling the tension and anger melt away, I realize that the disagreement was actually a blessing in disguise. It forced us to slow down, breathe, and connect with each other on a deeper level. And as we watch the hummingbird fly away into the sunset, I know that our friendship is stronger than ever.
