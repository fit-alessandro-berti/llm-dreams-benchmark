feel the familiar weight of expectation pressing down on your chest like a physical thing.

Your boss stands in the doorway of your office든xcept it's not really your office anymore. The walls have stretched outward, and the ceiling has climbed impossibly high, cathedral-like. Your desk is the same, though. The coffee stain shaped like a question mark is still there on the corner.

"We need this by end of day," your boss says, but their voice sounds like it's coming from underwater. You look at the clock. It reads both 9:00 AM and 4:47 PM simultaneously, the hands overlapping and splitting apart like cells dividing.

You open the project file, and the pages are filled with a language you somehow understand but can't read. The words rearrange themselves every time you focus on them. You start typing anyway, and your fingers know what to do even though your mind doesn't.

Then you notice your coworkers are all working in reverse등alking backward to the printer, un-drinking their coffee, their mouths moving in palindromes. Nobody else seems alarmed.

Your phone rings. It's your boss again, but you can still see them standing in the doorway. "How's it coming?" both versions ask in unison.

You look down at your screen. The project is finished. It's *beautiful*든legant, complete, something beyond what you thought you were capable of. But as you reach for the mouse to save it, the screen slowly goes dark, and you realize the building has no walls anymore. You're sitting at your desk in the middle of an open field under a violet sky.

Your boss smiles듢enuinely, warmly드nd says, "I knew you could do it."

And for a single, crystalline moment before waking, you believe them.
