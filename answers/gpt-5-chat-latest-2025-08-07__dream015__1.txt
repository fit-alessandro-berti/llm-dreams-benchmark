…venture out beyond the crumbling ruins of the city, determined to find something—anything—that might give meaning to your survival. The air is thick with dust, and the wind howls mournfully through hollow skyscrapers, their glass long since shattered. Your footsteps crunch over broken concrete and rusted metal as you pass faded murals, remnants of a world that used to celebrate hope.

You carry a small pack with only the bare essentials: a half-empty canteen, a serrated knife, and the last tin of food you could scavenge. Every sound makes your pulse quicken—far-off footsteps might be friend or predator, human or worse.

By midday, you spot movement on the horizon: a faint flicker of firelight. Against all logic, you head toward it. Maybe it’s a trap, maybe salvation. As you approach, shapes emerge from the dust—a small camp surrounded by makeshift barricades, guarded by weary faces holding crude weapons. They see you, tense, eyes sharp.

One of them steps forward, a tall figure wrapped in tattered scarves. Their voice is low, but deliberate:  
*"If you’ve made it this far, you must want something. But here, you pay for trust."*

You feel the weight of your choices pressing in. You can offer them your remaining supplies in trade for safety, bluff your way in with a false story, or turn and disappear into the wasteland to face the unknown alone.

In the dream, as you open your mouth to speak, **something else stirs in the distance—a low rumble, like thunder, but coming from the ground.** The camp looks nervous; they know what’s coming.

Do you want me to continue the dream to reveal *what’s approaching*, or branch it so you can *choose your fate* in this world?
