…and the air tightens around you, like the forest itself is holding its breath.

The birds go silent. The leaves stop whispering. You notice the light fading much faster than it should, as if someone is dimming the day with a giant invisible dial.

A wind rises—not a gentle breeze, but a low, rolling push that smells of rain and electricity. It moves through the trees in a single powerful wave, bending branches in one direction, then snapping them back. The canopy shivers. Somewhere far off, thunder mutters like a warning that hasn’t yet decided what it’s warning you about.

You look up.

The sky between the branches is no longer blue. The clouds are moving too quickly, funneling toward a single point overhead, spiraling in slow, deliberate circles. In the center of that spiral, there’s a hole—perfectly round, perfectly still. Through it, you don’t see sky. You see… something else.

It looks like a ceiling. A smooth, white surface, faintly lit, with hairline cracks that don’t belong in any sky. For a moment, you have the sharp, vertigo-like sense that the forest is the inside of someone’s mind, and you are standing in the middle of it.

A cold raindrop hits your forehead. Then another on your cheek. Then a dozen, then a hundred. But when you glance down, the ground doesn’t darken with wet soil. The drops splash silently and vanish before they land, as if the world has forgotten how to register rain.

The storm keeps building.

The wind begins to carry sounds that don’t belong in a forest at all: the faint chime of a phone notification, the distant hum of traffic, the muffled murmur of voices you almost recognize. Each gust feels like a half-remembered moment rushing past your skin.

The trees ahead part to reveal a small clearing you’re sure wasn’t there a moment ago. In the center of it stands a single enormous tree, wider than a house, its bark twisted with patterns that look suspiciously like words. As the lightning flickers in the distance, you catch fragments:

> **“WAKE UP”**
> **“STAY”**
> **“THIS IS IMPORTANT”**

You step closer, and the words blur into ordinary rings of age. Your heart is beating faster now—not from fear, exactly, but from the sense that you are right on the edge of understanding something.

Thunder cracks overhead, loud and sharp.

The spiral in the sky tightens, and a bolt of lightning shoots down—not to the ground, but to the great tree itself. Instead of burning, the tree glows from within, its trunk filling with a soft, golden light. The branches rise and twist into shapes: a door, a staircase, a hand reaching down.

The bark in front of you splits open with a quiet sigh, revealing a narrow doorway carved into the living wood. Inside, you see a warm glow and, impossibly, the gentle flicker of candlelight, as if there’s a room waiting just for you.

The rain around you is now falling in slow motion, each drop hanging in the air like tiny glass beads. The wind has stopped. Sound has thinned into a soft, distant hum.

You realize you have a choice:

You can stay in the storm, under the impossible sky with its strange, watching hole…
or you can step through the door in the tree and see what it’s been hiding from you all this time.

You reach out, place your hand on the glowing bark, and as you cross the threshold, the dream shifts—

—your foot lands on something solid that is not forest floor at all.

It feels familiar, like you’ve stood here many times before, in dreams you never fully remembered.

And somewhere behind you, thunder rolls one last time, like a book closing.
