The pen trembles in your hand as you scan the first page:

1.  **"Prove the existence of..."** The sentence trails off into a shimmering, liquid void where the theorem's name should be. The blank space seems to pulse faintly.
2.  **"Describe the socio-economic impact of..."** Below it, instead of a historical event or policy, there's a detailed, miniature watercolor painting of a dodo bird wearing a tiny top hat. Its eyes seem to follow your panicked gaze.
3.  **"Calculate the trajectory required for..."** The rest of the question is written in rapidly fading ink that bleeds into the paper, forming a Rorschach blot resembling a screaming face. You try to focus, but the numbers themselves squirm like worms.
4.  **"Translate the following passage from..."** The source language is listed as "Oblivion-Speak," and the text provided is just a series of intricate, shifting fractals that hum faintly. You swear you hear whispers emanating from the patterns.
5.  **"Demonstrate practical application of..."** The core concept is missing, replaced by a small, three-dimensional origami crane folded from the exam paper itself. It flaps its wings once, shedding glitter that turns into calculus symbols before vanishing.
6.  **"Essay Question: Argue for or against the proposition that..."** The proposition is entirely blank. Instead, a miniature holographic projector embedded in the paper flickers to life, showing rapid, confusing clips: your childhood home, a news report about a disaster you don't recognize, a close-up of your professor winking, and a map of a city you've never seen labeled "Your Future."
7.  **"Bonus Question (Mandatory):"** It simply shows a perfectly rendered, hyper-realistic sketch of *your own face*, looking terrified, with the words "Time's Up" written across your forehead in your own handwriting.

**The Dream Intensifies:**

*   **The Clock:** The wall clock melts like Dali's painting, its numbers dripping onto the floor. The puddle forms the word "SOON."
*   **Your Pencil:** It feels strangely heavy. You look down – it's turned into a writhing garden snake, cool and smooth in your grip. It flicks its tongue at the paper.
*   **The Professor:** You glance up for help, but the professor has transformed into a large, impassive ginger cat wearing tiny spectacles. It stares at you, blinks slowly, and licks a paw.
*   **The Other Students:** They seem oblivious, scribbling furiously. But as you look closer, you see their answers aren't words or numbers; they're knitting intricate patterns, building miniature castles from eraser shavings, or simply weeping silently onto their papers, the tears dissolving the questions.
*   **The Questions Shift:** The words on your paper start rearranging themselves. "Final Exam" becomes "Final Destination." "Career" becomes "Coffin." The origami crane now looks suspiciously like an angel.

**The Panic Peaks:**

You try to write *something* on the first question. As your snake-pencil touches the pulsing void, ink floods out uncontrollably, not forming words, but drawing a complex, branching flowchart labeled "Possible Life Paths." Most branches end abruptly in dark smudges or tiny skulls. One path, thin and shimmering, leads to a door marked "?".

The cat-professor jumps onto your desk, knocking over your water bottle. The water doesn't spill; it flows upwards, defying gravity, and forms a perfect, floating sphere above your paper. Inside the sphere, you see a reflection of yourself, much older, sitting in a completely different job, looking utterly bored. The sphere then pops, showering you in cold droplets that smell like antiseptic and old books.

You open your mouth to protest, to ask for clarification, but all that comes out is the faint, mournful cooing of the origami crane now perched on your shoulder. The melted clock-puddle on the floor begins to bubble, spelling out "TOO LATE."

You wake with a gasp just as the first drop of bubbling clock-puddle touches your shoe, the phantom cooing still echoing in your ears, the terrifying weight of the unwritten future pressing down on you, frozen in that moment of exam hall purgatory.
