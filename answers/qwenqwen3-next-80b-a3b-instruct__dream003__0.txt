…symbols etched into its surface—tiny, spiraling glyphs that shimmer like liquid mercury under the dim, dreamlight. They’re not carved; they *move*. Slowly. Deliberately. As if breathing.

You reach out—to touch, to trace—and the moment your fingertip brushes the cool metal, the box *whispers*.

Not in words. In *memories*.

A childhood lullaby your grandmother sang while rocking you—the one you swore you’d forgotten.  
The smell of rain on hot pavement the day you first kissed someone.  
The sound of your own laughter, clearer and brighter than you’ve heard in years.

The box isn’t locked to keep things *in*.

It’s locked to keep things *remembered*.

A voice—soft, familiar, like your own but older—echoes from within:

> *“You sealed this away when you thought you couldn’t carry it. But carrying isn’t the same as holding… You still have space.”*

The glyphs begin to unravel, swirling upward like smoke, forming a key… made of your own shadow, shaped by your sorrow, your joy, your regrets.

You hesitate.

The key hovers, waiting.

Do you unlock it?

And if you do… what will you choose to remember?

The air grows thick with silence.

Somewhere, in the dark beyond the dream, a clock ticks—not backward, not forward—but sideways.

And suddenly, you realize…

… *you were the one who locked it*.

And the key was never lost.

It was always yours to wield.

You reach for it.

And the box… opens.

Not with a clang…

But with the sound of wings.

*(You wake up—with a single feather on your pillow… and a whisper you can’t quite place…)*

> *“Thank you for remembering me.”*
