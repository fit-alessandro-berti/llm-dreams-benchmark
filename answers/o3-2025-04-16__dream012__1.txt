…and you tighten your grip on the rain‑slicked rail, feeling the deck buck like a living thing beneath your boots. Lightning cleaves the sky, turning the black waves into white, writhing sculptures for the span of a heartbeat.  

“Hard to starboard!” you shout, voice carrying above the wind only because everyone on deck is waiting for it. Sailors scramble, ropes hiss, the mainsail booms as it swings. For a moment the bow rises so steeply you worry she’ll pitch over backwards, but the Emerald Gull crests the wave and slams down with a shudder that rattles the lanterns in their brackets.

You scan the chaos. To port, the reef’s jagged teeth loom whenever lightning flashes. Dead ahead, the storm wall folds in on itself—purple, green, almost luminous, like the throat of some cosmic whale. You know there’s open water on the other side; you can feel it in the pressure of the air, the subtle shift of the wind’s tone. The trick is threading the gap.

A young deckhand—Davies, barely seventeen—slides across the wet planks and catches the rail. “Skipper, the compass’s spinning! We can’t keep a heading.”

You kneel beside him, steadying the brass instrument with one hand. The needle whirls, then freezes, pointing not to north but toward a faint, pulsing glow beneath the waves. For an instant, the sea is translucent; below, you glimpse something vast and slow and patient—a leviathan following your course, scales shimmering like moonlit armor.

The crew waits for your verdict. Fear blows through them like a cold draft, but they trust you more than any compass.

“Helm, follow the light,” you decide, surprising even yourself. “Reef the foresail, give her just enough canvas to keep steerage. We ride the leviathan’s wake.”

Orders echo. The Gull heels, aligning with the underwater radiance. Immediately, the wind’s fury lessens, as though an invisible corridor has opened. Waves still tower, but they no longer break across the deck; instead they split and curl away, diverted by the unseen creature below.

Minutes—or centuries—pass in that trembling half‑light. The storm rages everywhere except the narrow path you occupy, as if the sea itself has granted you safe conduct. Crewmen stare over the rails in silent awe. Even the rigging stops its frantic clatter and thrums like a temple bell.

At last the black wall of cloud thins to mist. The Gull bursts into a dome of calm, moonwashed water. Behind you, the storm closes like a curtain, hiding the leviathan’s parting silhouette.

You exhale for the first time since the nightmare began. The crew cheers, some weep, others sink to their knees and kiss the planks. Looking up, you find the North Star steady and bright—as if it never wandered at all.

Then a final rumble reaches you, not thunder but something spoken in the deep: a single, resonant note that resonates in your bones. A blessing, perhaps, or a farewell.

Your eyelids flutter. The ship, the sea, the grateful faces fade to silver vapor. You wake in your own bed, heart still pounding with salt and wind, certain of only one thing:

Somewhere beneath the waking world, the leviathan still swims, waiting for the night you take the helm again.
