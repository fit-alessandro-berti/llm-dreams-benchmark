You start to wander the labyrinthine streets of the unfamiliar city, your footsteps echoing in a maze of towering, shifting buildings that seem to lean inwards as if breathing. The sky above pulses with an indeterminate color, casting long, warped shadows. Your map is useless—streets twist and merge, and landmarks vanish the moment you glance away. A faint, haunting melody drifts from an alleyway, a tune you can’t quite place but feel in your bones. Following it, you stumble upon a shopfront with mirrored panels, its sign glowing faintly in the dim light. Inside, a shopkeeper with eyes like polished obsidian offers you a key inscribed with a glowing symbol. *“To find your meeting,”* they say, *“you must first recall what you’ve forgotten.”* You search your pockets frantically, but the memory slips away like smoke. The shopkeeper smirks, and the mirror behind them reflects not your face but a map of the city laid out in constellations. A riddle etches itself into your mind: *“The answer lies where time bends, but you walk alone.”*  

As you grasp the key, the city’s bridges begin to crumble, and a bridge of light materializes ahead, leading to a monolithic building crowned with a clockwork orbit. Its doors are sealed with the same symbol as the key, and you realize the melody was the clock’s ticking, slowed to a haunting crawl. The building looms, its gears turning in reverse, as if time itself is resisting your progress. You feel the weight of forgotten moments pressing against your mind—their faces flickering at the edge of your vision. With a shuddering breath, you insert the key into the door, and the symbol aligns with the riddle’s clue: *“Where the past and future collide, the present breathes.”* The door groans open, revealing a chamber where the meeting’s host waits, surrounded by floating hourglasses and a table etched with the same constellations from the mirror. But as you step inside, the city outside begins to unravel, and you wonder if the dream’s purpose was never to reach the meeting… but to confront what you’ve *already* forgotten.  

The clockwork orbit spins faster, and the room dissolves into a kaleidoscope of memories—your own face, a voice you can’t hear, a door that *was* here but isn’t now. When you wake, the city is gone, and you’re back in your bed, clutching the key in your hand. Outside your window, the stars seem to whisper the riddle’s answer: *“You were never lost.”*
