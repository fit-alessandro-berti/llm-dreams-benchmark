You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to **realize I haven't prepared a single word. Panic claws at my throat, making it hard to breathe. My palms are slick with sweat. I look down, and my notes – usually a meticulously organized collection of bullet points and witty asides – are blank. A cold wave of dread washes over me.

Then, something shifts. The blank page, the vast audience, the suffocating pressure... it all starts to dissolve, like sand slipping through my fingers. The stage itself begins to shimmer and waver, the edges blurring. The faces in the crowd start to change, morphing into grotesque caricatures of people I vaguely know – my overly-critical aunt, the guy who always cuts in line at the coffee shop, my childhood bully. They're all smiling, but their smiles are stretched too wide, revealing teeth that are far too sharp.

Suddenly, the stage isn't a stage anymore. I'm standing on a giant, wobbling marshmallow, slowly sinking into its sugary depths. The audience laughs, a chorus of mocking, high-pitched cackles that echo in the vast, empty space. The microphone in my hand transforms into a dripping ice cream cone, and I feel a strange urge to lick it, even though the marshmallow is pulling me down.

The cackling intensifies. I try to scream, but only a muffled gurgle escapes my lips. The audience is now made of brightly colored, bouncing jelly beans, each one with a tiny, judgmental face. The marshmallow is now waist-deep, the sticky sweetness coating my clothes and pulling at my skin.

Then, I see it. At the very edge of the marshmallow, just beyond the reach of the jelly bean audience, stands a small, familiar figure. It's my dog, Sparky, wagging his tail and looking at me with pure, unwavering love. He's wearing a tiny, sparkly tuxedo and holding a tiny, red fire hydrant.

He barks, a clear, strong bark that cuts through the jelly bean laughter. Then, he throws the fire hydrant. It sails through the air, leaving a trail of glittering sprinkles, and lands squarely on the giant marshmallow.

A geyser of water erupts. The marshmallow dissolves. The jelly beans scatter. The laughter ceases.

I gasp, sputtering, and I'm sitting up in bed, soaked in sweat, with Sparky, in his real dog form, licking my face. He’s wagging his tail, looking concerned. The dream is over. But the lingering taste of sweetness and the echo of Sparky's bark… it lingers, a strange, comforting reminder that even in the face of utter disaster, there's always a good boy to save the day.**
