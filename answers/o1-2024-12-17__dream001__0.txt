…wander through streets that stretch on endlessly, each one branching into smaller alleys and hidden courtyards. The buildings are towering and ornate, blending architectural styles you can’t quite name—some are sleek and glass-walled; others are heavy with stone arches and iron balconies. Though it’s midday, the light feels strangely muted, as if the entire city is filtered through a haze of pale amber.

You try to recall the name of the place you’re supposed to be—some elegant, old building that houses an organization you need to impress. But the name escapes you, dissolving whenever you think you have it. You check your watch and realize only fifty minutes remain. Your heart starts to thump a bit faster. You pick one of the major avenues and walk briskly, hoping to find a landmark or a helpful sign, but the street names seem to be written in swirling, unfamiliar characters.

As you pass people, you notice their faces flicker between familiarity and strangeness. A man in a tailored suit looks at you sympathetically, as if he knows you’re lost, but he says nothing. A woman pushing a stroller hums a tune you almost recognize, and you pause, thinking to ask her for directions. But when you turn, she’s gone—vanished as if she slipped into a side alley you didn’t see.

Time is running. You turn a corner and find yourself in a bustling square crowded with food vendors, small performance troupes, and musicians playing instruments you’ve never heard of. The smells are intoxicating: grilled vegetables, spiced meat, sweet pastries. You are tempted to stop and ask one of these kind-faced vendors for help. Perhaps someone here will know the building you’re seeking. You approach an older woman selling fruit out of a wooden cart; her apples are a deep crimson and look more luminous than any you’ve encountered.

“Excuse me,” you say, words feeling heavy on your tongue. “I’m looking for the place where I have a meeting. It’s very important. I believe it’s called the House of Seven Arches.” The words tumble out spontaneously—you didn’t even realize you remembered that name until you spoke it. The woman regards you with mild surprise, then points across the square, through an alley dimly lit with strings of lanterns.

“Go through there,” she says quietly, “keep walking until the streets narrow. When you find a door that doesn’t seem to belong, knock three times.”

Her instructions are oddly specific. You thank her and hurry toward the alley, weaving through children chasing a bright red ball and a small chorus chanting something in a language that sounds ancient. The alley leads you into a part of the city where the buildings loom closer, the windows narrower. A sense of urgency grips you as your watch now shows only twenty-five minutes left.

The narrow street begins to curve unexpectedly. You realize the architecture here is different: The walls are blank, featureless, no signs, no decoration. You remember her words: “a door that doesn’t seem to belong.” Soon you see it—a simple wooden door, worn and unmarked, set into a wall of smooth marble. It looks entirely out of place, as though someone simply stuck it there with no intention of matching the surrounding façade. You approach and raise your hand to knock.

One knock. The hollow sound is almost lost in the hush of the alley.  
Two knocks. You think you hear a rustling behind the door.  
Three knocks. The door swings open silently, revealing a spiral staircase lit by unseen torches flickering with a soft, silvery glow.

Time is short, but something tells you this is right. You climb the stairs quickly, the space around you growing warmer, the silence replaced by faint voices echoing up from above. Each step feels oddly buoyant, as if you could float at any moment. Finally, you emerge into a circular hall with arched windows overlooking the city’s skyline. It’s breathtaking—rooftops stretching into a pinkish horizon, towers silhouetted against the cloud-swept sky.

In the center of the hall stands a long table with high-backed chairs. Several people are already seated, their faces illuminated by a soft light that seems to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. They are dressed in fine suits and robes and cloaks, a mix of styles and eras that make no immediate sense together. Their eyes are kind, curious. As you walk forward, one of them, a tall figure with silver hair and measured posture, beckons you to sit.

“Welcome,” they say, voice echoing just slightly. “We’ve been expecting you.”

You check your watch one last time before taking your seat. You’re right on time.
