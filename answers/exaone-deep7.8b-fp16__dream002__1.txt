As you stands in the hushed stillness of the forest, the air grows still and heavy with tension. Dark shadows pool beneath the canopy, and the distant rustle of leaves suddenly seems alive. Your bare legs brush against ferns, but an icy chill crawls up your arms. The sky, once a cerulean quilt, begins to tear open like a torn suture. 

**The storm arrives in fractured pieces:**  
Thunder rumbles deep in the earth, and the first spitting drop falls where no rain has ever fallen. Wind slaps your skin like wet rope, carrying a whisper of dirt and decay. Trees groan under the assault, their branches whip around you like skeletal fingers. A bolt of ice punches downward, splitting the air—but you see where it’s aimed: your left eye. The world narrows to the threat and your pulse-quickening breath.  

You sprint backward, scrambling over rocks as the tempest tears at you. Rain sluices down your chest, freezing your breath into ice points. Halfway across a river you see it: a jagged chunk of ancient boulder, its edges sharp as broken glass. You clamber onto it, the icy current gnawing at your ankles in a painful song.  

**Amid the chaos, a shard of light pierces the clouds. It’s meager, but you see it:** a sun-fleeting opening where distant thunder hangs, its edges brushing away from the wind. The storm rages below, but that sliver promises safety. You shout for others—half-heard calls that vanish like smoke—but the boulder’s stability wavers. 

Finally, the tempest retreats, not gracefully, in a violent sigh. Rain pounds the earth as you scramble down the rock to the safety of moss-carpeted soil. Exhausted, you curl into a fetal huddle, watching the storm’s tail vanish into twilight. Behind you, the forest exhales rain-scented air, and the trees’ branches sway loosely. 

The calm returns—briefly, a balmy air on your skin—before another rumble shakes the hills. But you’re already moving between ancient trees, the storm’s fleeting tyranny conquered. Above, clouds heap and disperse, and the sun peeks through again, gilding the world in tentative gold. The dream ends there, leaving you with the echo of thunder and the quiet triumph of survival.
