…you tighten your grip on the slick wheel and feel the ship shudder like a living thing under your feet.

The sky is a bruised ceiling of clouds, stitched with sudden white seams of lightning. Each flash freezes your crew in sharp relief—faces pale, eyes wide, hands clenched around rope and rail as if the wood itself is the last honest thing left in the world.

“Hold her into it!” someone shouts, but the wind steals half the words and throws them back as salt.

You open your mouth to answer and realize your voice doesn’t come out as sound. It comes out as something else—like a thought given weight. The moment you decide what to do, the ship responds. Not to commands. To certainty.

A wave rises ahead, impossibly tall, a moving wall that seems to carry the darkness inside it. For an instant you understand: the storm isn’t outside the ship. It’s around you, yes, but it’s also around the feeling in your chest you’ve been refusing to name.

Your first mate crawls to you on hands and knees, hair plastered to their face. “Captain,” they say, close enough now that the words stick. “Where are we going?”

The compass in its brass cradle spins so fast the needle becomes a circle. The map in the chart case is blank—no coastlines, no ink, only wet paper that smells faintly of smoke.

“We’re going,” you say, and this time your voice is your own, “where this ends.”

Lightning strikes the sea off your starboard side and, in the afterimage, you see it: not a wave, not a reef, but a door—upright in the water, wooden and ordinary, bobbing between swells as if it belongs there. Each time the ship rises, the door rises too, patiently waiting to be approached.

The crew sees it at the same time. A murmur goes through them like a prayer starting without permission.

“That’s not—” someone begins.

“It’s something,” you interrupt, because if you let doubt in, the storm will take it as an invitation.

You point—not with your arm, but with your mind—and the bow swings toward the door as if a current has taken hold of the keel. The ship groans, resisting, then yielding. The wheel is suddenly warm under your palms.

The sea tries to stop you. A wave slams the hull and the world tilts. Barrels break loose below, glass shatters, someone cries out. You taste blood where your teeth cut your lip. You smell tar and wet canvas and fear.

Then the door is close enough to see details: chipped paint, a tarnished handle, a small peephole. A number, too, nailed near the top, though the digits won’t stay the same when you look directly at them—12, 7, 3, 0—like it can’t decide which memory it belongs to.

“Captain!” the first mate yells. “We can’t sail through that!”

You look at the door and feel a strange calm, thin as paper but steady.

“We don’t sail through it,” you say. “We go to it.”

You leave the wheel. No one stops you. Your boots splash across the deck as if the ship is already half-submerged. The railing is slick; the wind claws at your coat. When you climb onto the bow, the crew’s voices fade behind you, reduced to muffled shapes by the roar.

You leap.

The sea is a cold fist. It wraps you in a shock so sharp it feels like waking up, but you don’t wake. You swim toward the door, each stroke a decision. The storm drags at you like regret.

When your hand closes around the handle, the metal is warm.

You pull.

The door opens inward, not into the sea, but into a hallway lit by a single bulb that hums with tired electricity. The smell changes instantly: not salt and wind, but dust and old paper and something familiar—coffee, maybe, or the soap from a childhood sink.

Water pours off you onto linoleum. You step inside, and the moment your feet cross the threshold the storm’s roar drops away like a curtain falling.

Behind you, through the open doorway, you can still see the ship bucking in the waves—your ship, your crew—except it’s smaller now, as if it’s far away, or as if you’ve grown.

Your crew is still looking at you. Their mouths are moving, but you can’t hear them.

You reach back, grab the edge of the doorframe, and shout, “Come on!”

No sound. But the certainty returns, filling your chest like breath.

One by one, they understand without hearing. The first mate is the first to move, climbing to the bow with the desperate grace of someone who has decided to believe. They jump, hit the water, swim, and when they grab the handle their face changes—fear replaced by recognition.

They step through, dripping, laughing once in disbelief.

More follow. Some hesitate. Some nearly get pulled under by the sea and have to be hauled up by the hands already inside. Each person who crosses makes the hallway a little brighter, the bulb less tired, the air less stale.

When the last of them makes it, you turn back to the doorway.

The ship is still out there. Empty now, but not abandoned—it’s waiting, rocking gently, as if relieved. The storm continues to rage around it, but it seems smaller too, like a tantrum that can’t find a target.

You realize you could close the door and leave it behind.

You also realize you don’t have to.

You step into the frame once more, half in the hallway and half in the sea’s wild breath, and you look at your ship—not with guilt, not with longing, but with gratitude. It carried you through the part you didn’t know how to name.

“Thank you,” you whisper, and this time the words do exist.

The ship’s lanterns flicker, as if answering.

You pull the door shut.

The latch clicks with a finality that isn’t cruel, just complete.

The hallway stretches ahead. At the far end is another door—this one painted a calm blue, the kind of color people choose when they want to believe in peace. From behind it comes a sound you haven’t heard in a long time: quiet.

Your crew stands around you, soaked and shivering but alive, their eyes adjusting to the light. Someone asks, voice small, “What now, Captain?”

You look down at your hands. They’re still salt-rough, but steady. You feel the storm inside you, distant now—not gone, but no longer steering.

You place your palm on the blue door.

And on the other side, something—or someone—draws a breath, as if they’ve been waiting for you to arrive.

You turn the handle.

And you wake with the taste of salt on your lips, the echo of thunder in your bones, and the strange, clear certainty that you did not survive by fighting the sea.

You survived by choosing where to go.
