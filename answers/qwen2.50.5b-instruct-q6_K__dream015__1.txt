Absolutely! Given your circumstances, I will strive to help you find sustainable solutions for your needs while ensuring a safe environment. Here’s a scenario:
- **Resources:**
  - Potable water from underground sources.
  - Emergency food supplies that are easily accessible through local networks.
  - Energy for powering electronics and appliances, possibly collected during the day or using traditional methods found in remote areas.

- **Dangers:**
  - Natural disasters like earthquakes, typhoons, and hurricanes (as these events are often unpredictable).
  - Lack of modern infrastructure to manage floods or prevent other natural disasters.
  - The existence of wildlife that can pose a threat to humans but remains unseen by human detection due to reduced visibility after decades of conflict.

- **Personal Needs:**
  - Basic medical aid supplies, including basic medicines and clean water filters for your drinking water (water purified through distillation instead of UV treatment).
  - Personal hygiene products, potentially in the form of personal hygiene products that can be sourced from local vendors.
  
This environment presents unique challenges and opportunities. Resources can be gathered sustainably using natural techniques like fermentation to make a limited amount of food or simply growing food in gardens. Emergency supplies might need to be managed and distributed through communal channels.

To survive, you will likely focus on securing safe shelter options based on current threats (e.g., tents made from materials found locally) and potential future adaptations, possibly using creative methods like building makeshift shelters using discarded logs or bamboo poles. It may also mean exploring alternative transportation methods, perhaps renting a rented vehicle that can operate during extended period when you have reliable water sources.

Remember to always prioritize hygiene and safety as a crucial part of survival. With the right resources, you’ve made choices well-advertised, but understanding how to maintain their use alongside natural disasters is critical for the long-term development of your community.
