You wake up in a sun-drenched courtyard, the air thick with the scent of oil paint and fresh bread. The cobblestone streets around you hum with the chatter of merchants, the clang of blacksmiths, and the distant melody of a lute. A banner overhead reads *“Florentia, 1492”* in bold, archaic script. No phones. No cars. Just a world of parchment, parchment, and more parchment.  

As you stumble through the labyrinth of narrow alleys, you notice everyone wears garments of wool and linen, their faces lit by the golden glow of oil lamps. A child hands you a loaf of bread, calling you *“straniero”*—foreigner. You realize you’ve no money, no papers, and no clue how to navigate this era. But then you spot a familiar symbol: a red-and-gold banner bearing the crest of a man you’ve only seen in textbooks.  

*Leonardo da Vinci’s workshop.*  

You knock. The door creaks open to reveal a man with ink-stained hands and a gaze that seems to see through you. “You’re late,” he says, not unkindly. “The *Vitruvian Man* needs refining, and the clockwork bird… it’s *almost* ready.” He thrusts a sketch into your hands—a blueprint of a device that looks suspiciously like a helicopter. “Fix the gears. The Duke’s envoy arrives tomorrow.”  

But as you work, a shadow lingers at the edge of the workshop. A woman in a dark cloak, her face hidden, watches you with a look of recognition… or warning. When you ask who she is, Leonardo only mutters, “She’s not from here. But she’s *looking for you*.”  

The dream shifts. You’re now a character in a story you didn’t write, bound to a timeline that isn’t yours. Do you trust Leonardo? Follow the cloaked woman? Or try to flee this era before the clockwork bird takes flight—and whatever it’s meant to do?  

The streets of Florence stretch endlessly, and the weight of history presses down on you. Your next move could alter the course of art, invention… or your own survival.
