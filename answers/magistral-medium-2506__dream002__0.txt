you hurry to find shelter. The wind howls through the trees, and the first drops of rain begin to fall, cold and heavy. As you run, the path ahead splits—one way leads to a dark, gnarled cave, the other to a fragile-looking wooden bridge swaying in the wind.

You hesitate, but before you can decide, a flash of lightning illuminates the forest, revealing a shadowy figure standing between the two paths. The figure’s face is obscured by a hood, and they extend a hand toward you. Their voice is barely audible over the storm:

*"Choose quickly—the cave hides what was lost, but the bridge leads to what could be."*

The rain intensifies, and the ground trembles as thunder shakes the earth. What do you do?

(Would you like to explore the cave, cross the bridge, or something else?)
