…a brush made of liquid moonlight, hovering just above the canvas as if waiting for your touch.

You reach out—but your fingers pass through it, and the brush shudders, rippling into a thousand tiny birds made of stained glass. They spiral upward, each wing beating out a color you’ve never named: *velvet sigh*, *whisper amber*, *the sound of silence folded into twilight*. 

The canvas doesn't stay blank.

It breathes.

Slowly, as if remembering a forgotten song, it begins to paint itself—not with pigment, but with memory. Faces flicker across its surface: your grandmother laughing with green hair, a child you never met holding a key made of clouds, a door you opened in another life that led only to a room filled with the scent of rain on hot pavement.

Then, quietly, a voice—not from outside, but from the center of your chest—whispers:

*"You’re not painting the world. You’re remembering what it was before you forgot how to see."*

The canvas pulses. Colors surge—not chaotic, but harmonious, like a symphony of light. Shapes coil into arches of possibility, rivers of sound crystallize into mountains, and above it all, a single word forms, written not in ink, but in the absence of color:

**You.**

You realize—you *are* the canvas.

The surreal world isn’t around you.

It’s *you*.

And every color you’ve ever feared, every shape you’ve tried to ignore… they’re not mistakes.

They’re breadcrumbs.

Back to yourself.

The brush returns—not as a tool, but as a sigh.

You take it.

And for the first time, you do not paint what you think you should.

You paint what you *feel*.

A single tear falls.

It lands on the canvas… and blooms into a universe.

You wake.

Your pillow is the color of forgotten birthdays.

And your hand? It’s trembling—not with fear.

But wonder.
