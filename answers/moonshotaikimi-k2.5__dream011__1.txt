 ...written in silver ink that shifts and swims across the page like tadpoles in a slow-moving pond. When you try to focus on Question 1, the letters rearrange themselves into your mother's handwriting, asking not about thermodynamics or contract law—whatever this course was supposed to be—but instead: *"Why did you leave the door open that Tuesday?"*

You look up. The lecture hall has elongated impossibly; the back wall is now a mile away, shrouded in fog. The other students are still there, but their heads are bowed so low that their foreheads have fused to the wooden desks, growing roots down into the floorboards. The proctor stands at the front, but she has no face—just a smooth oval of skin where features should be—and she's holding a pocket watch that drips rather than ticks, each falling second hissing when it hits the carpet.

You look back at the paper. The questions have become photographs, moving ones, showing you at ages you haven't lived yet. Question 3 depicts you at eighty-two, trying to remember the names of flowers in a garden that hasn't been planted. The comma at the end of the sentence unhooks itself and crawls to the edge of the page, seeking refuge in your sleeve.

Your pen feels warm, then hot. When you touch it to the answer booklet, it bleeds not ink but sand, piling up in the margins, creating miniature dunes that bury Question 4 before you can decipher it. But that's okay—suddenly you remember you don't need this exam. You never enrolled in this course. The future career it promised was just a scrap of newspaper with yesterday's date crumpled in a wet gutter.

You stand up. The chair doesn't make a sound; it simply stops existing the moment you cease touching it. The faceless proctor tilts her head in a gesture of permission, and the roof of the lecture hall rolls back like a scroll, revealing not sky but deep water, schools of those silver words swimming in constellations above.

You walk toward the exit, but the door has become a mirror. In it, you see yourself holding the exam paper, and all the answers are written in the lines of your palms, glowing briefly like fireflies trapped in amber before they fade. 

You press your hand against the glass. Your fingers sink through as if into warm wax. On the other side, you are lying in bed, but your sheets are covered in those swimming silver letters, still rearranging themselves into tomorrow's grocery list, and you realize with a slow, spreading calm that you have already passed—there was never anything to fail, only this: the soft, persistent drift of ink becoming sand becoming sleep becoming morning.
