You start to **frantically pat your pockets**, a cold dread blooming in your chest. Phone? Wallet? An invitation? Nothing. Just the smooth, unfamiliar fabric of the strange clothes you seem to be wearing.

You spin around, trying to get your bearings. The city is a chaotic symphony of towering, impossibly-angled buildings in shades of bruised purple and sickly green. Flying vehicles, shaped like iridescent beetles, zip between them, their hum a constant, unnerving thrum. The air smells faintly of cinnamon and ozone.

Panic claws at your throat. "Excuse me!" you call out to a passerby, a tall figure draped in shimmering, liquid-like fabric, their face obscured by a mask resembling a porcelain bird. They glide past without a glance. Everyone seems to be moving with urgent, silent purpose, except you.

You lurch forward, picking a direction at random, your heart hammering against your ribs. The pavement underfoot feels soft, almost like moss, and it subtly shifts with each step. You stumble into a square filled with statues that seem to writhe and change shape in your peripheral vision. In the center, a fountain spews not water, but what looks like molten gold, which evaporates into shimmering dust before it hits the basin.

"The meeting!" you whisper, the words feeling thick and strange in your mouth. You see a small, unassuming doorway tucked between two colossal, leaning towers. It’s emitting a faint, rhythmic pulsing light, like a heartbeat. Drawn by an inexplicable pull, you push it open.

Instead of a room, you find yourself on a rickety wooden bridge suspended over a chasm filled with swirling, starlit mist. The bridge stretches towards a single, distant point of light. Far below, you can hear what sounds like a choir singing in a language you don't understand, yet it feels profoundly significant.

The stone in your pocket from earlier (when did you pick that up?) suddenly grows warm, vibrating gently. It seems to be urging you forward, across the terrifyingly unstable bridge. You take a hesitant step, then another, the wood groaning ominously beneath your weight. The meeting, you feel with a sudden, dream-born certainty, is at the other end of this impossible crossing. And the clock is most definitely ticking.
