…gladly accept their outstretched hands.

They weave you through neon–lit back-alleys that smell of rain and cinnamon, speaking in soft, lilting voices you can’t quite place on any map. One offers you a paper umbrella painted with constellations; another presses a warm cup of jasmine tea into your palms. The city’s noise fades until the only sound is the hush of your own breath and the gentle clang of distant wind chimes.

At last they stop before an iron gate you swear you’ve never noticed. Vines bloom with luminescent flowers, opening as you approach, the petals curling back like old friends. The tallest stranger—whose eyes shift between every color you’ve ever seen—whispers, “Your way home is through the place you forgot existed.”

The gate swings open. Inside lies a hidden courtyard: cobblestones glimmer like stars, and a quiet river runs in reverse, water floating upward into the charcoal sky. You recognize the river from childhood sketches you’d long since lost. Drifting on its current is a small paper boat bearing your name in careful handwriting.

You follow the strangers onto a bridge of lanterns that bob beneath your weight. Each step lights a memory: your first laugh, your first act of courage, the moment you decided to dream bigger than the world allowed. The memories float into the sky and become new constellations, guiding you forward.

At the center of the courtyard stands a mirror framed in golden ivy. “Look,” the strangers say in one voice. You expect your reflection, but instead the glass reveals a skyline bathed in dawn—the very city you feared, now glowing with possibility. Where panic once clutched your chest, you feel a bright, steady pulse of belonging.

You reach out and touch the mirror. Warmth spreads through your fingertips, racing up your arms to your heart. The strangers bow and dissolve into motes of light that swirl around you, forming a luminous compass on your wrist. Its needle points not north, but inward.

With a soft breath, you step through the mirror. City streets unfurl beneath a peach-colored sunrise, and the crowd that once felt overwhelming now moves like a gentle tide. You realize you’re no longer lost; every corner, every passerby feels like part of a vast, welcoming story that knows your name.

A distant bell tolls. You wake in your own bed, morning light pouring through the curtains, the scent of jasmine lingering in the air. On your nightstand rests a folded paper boat bearing your name, and upon your wrist, a faint outline of a compass that wasn’t there before—its needle still pointing to the quiet place inside you where you will never be alone again.
