**The Storm’s Heart**

The wind howls like a wounded beast, tearing at the sails as if the very sky seeks to devour your ship. The *Iron Mermaid* groans beneath you, her timbers straining, her mast creaking like the bones of a dying giant. The waves rise—black, towering, crowned with foam—and crash over the deck in sheets of ice-cold fury. Your crew moves like shadows in the storm, their faces pale beneath the flickering lantern light, their hands gripping ropes and rails as if clinging to the last threads of hope.

You stand at the helm, salt stinging your eyes, your coat heavy with seawater. The compass spins wildly, its needle drunk on the chaos. The sea is no longer a path—it is a living thing, hungry, testing you.

Then, through the howling dark, a voice cuts through the storm.

*"Captain!"*

It’s **Elias**, your first mate, his voice raw with fear. He points astern, where the waves part for a single, terrible moment. There, in the heart of the tempest, something *moves*. Not a whale. Not a reef. Something *older*.

A shape—vast, serpentine, its scales glinting like wet obsidian—coils through the water, its eyes burning like drowned stars. The crew freezes. Some drop to their knees. Others whisper prayers in languages you don’t recognize.

The beast *sings*.

Not a roar. Not a hiss. A *song*—deep, mournful, vibrating through the hull of the ship, through your bones, through the marrow of your soul. It is the sound of a thousand shipwrecks, of sailors lost to the deep, of promises broken beneath the waves.

And then—it *speaks*.

**"You carry what is mine."**

Your blood turns to ice.

Because you *do*.

In the locked chest beneath your cabin, wrapped in oilcloth and bound with iron, lies the **Tear of the Leviathan**—a gem said to hold the last breath of the first sea god. You took it from a drowned temple, against every warning, against every omen. And now, the sea has come to collect its due.

The crew turns to you. Their eyes are wide, desperate. Some beg. Some curse. Some weep.

The storm rages on.

The beast rises higher, its maw opening to reveal a cavern of teeth, each one a jagged shard of bone.

And then—

A choice.

Do you:

1. **Order the crew to fight**—unleash the cannons, raise the storm sails, and try to outrun the beast, even as the sea itself seems to turn against you.
2. **Offer the Tear**—throw the gem into the waves, hoping the beast will take it and spare your ship… or will it only make it *hungrier*?
3. **Lie**—tell the crew the gem is cursed, that you never took it, and order them to abandon ship while you slip away with the treasure… but the sea *knows*.
4. **Something else**—whisper a command, draw a symbol in the air, or do the one thing no captain should ever do: *bargain*.

The storm waits.

The beast *waits*.

What do you do, Captain?
