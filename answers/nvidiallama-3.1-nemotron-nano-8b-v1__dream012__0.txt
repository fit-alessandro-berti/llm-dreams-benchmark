**To complete the dream:**

The captain's voice scraped against the-sky scrap of the storm, each word a clarion call. The riggers scurried to either side of him, their hands trembling as they gripped the lines and levers. "Tell the riggers to lock and secure the damaged hull ports with the integrity cap," he said, his breath catching in his throat. The cowbell of the propeller one side clunked in his hand, instinctively mimicking the lessons he'd drilled. 

The ship shuddered like a living thing, its hull groaning with each wave. Lift dripped from the elements, a tug of war between the captain's futile efforts and the fickle forces of fate. The captain's gaze darted past, a fleeting accusation, then settled back on the crew. "Renforce the barrier with your worry-hats' ascontents and move! Give's get it intact..."

A muffled scream burst from the deck, hoarses climbing to challenge the cacophony of the storm. The captain turned. "Hum. A breach is coming. The riggers work swiftly while I... I need to— 

His voice cut off, a sharp, pained iron of cracked steel. The crew stumbled past him, disoriented, their movements a chaotic blur under the howling sea. The captain's body took on a numinous aspect, no more whole. "Argh... Alenka! Fix Lelika! Len crowds...". The words spilled out, a jumble of confusion. The riggers' helmet pots clanging, a series of mechanical clicks—contemplate the turmoil around from that anarchy. 

"Get it out! Quickly, or—", the captain finished, his eyes aflame. The ship sputtered, its wake flattening into a pastel Nabi residue. One critical syllable after the captain's turn sent a tidal surge through the water, ending the continuity of the clash. For a moment, the stillness was a reminder of the captain's disconnection. Then, as the waves receded into eternal oblivion, the captain's disembodied voice fabricated itself agreeable, a study in regulatory phraseology, a desperate nodum to the crew's wilting survival instincts. "I'm going to notify the station. We'll... bond with my head valve."
