...and you feel the weight of their expectant stare on you like a physical force. The project file on your desk isn't just paper; it feels *heavy*, pulsing slightly with a low, urgent hum. You reach for it, but your fingers seem to slow down, moving through thick, unseen air. The clock on the wall isn't ticking, it's *dripping* seconds onto the carpet, each drop expanding into a tiny, shimmering puddle that reflects your increasingly panicked face.

Your boss clears their throat, and the sound echoes through the office like thunder. "Well?" they boom, their voice now resonating from everywhere at once. You try to open the file, but the cover is warm and sticky, like caramel. When you finally pry it open, there are no pages inside, just a swirling vortex of fog and distant whispers that sound suspiciously like old television static mixed with your own name. *This* is the project? Navigate the static-fog?

You look up at your boss, and their head seems to stretch towards the ceiling, their eyes wide and unblinking, reflecting the flickering office lights like giant, unsettling mirrors. The air in the room grows thick, smelling faintly of burnt toast and rain. You know you have to start, but you don't have tools, you don't have instructions, and the project is literally a void. Panic clenches your chest, and you feel like you're sinking into your chair, which is slowly turning into quicksand. You desperately try to ask a question, any question, but when you open your mouth, only a tiny, perfectly formed snowflake falls out and melts instantly on your desk, adding to the growing puddle from the clock. Your boss leans forward, their face now looming impossibly large, and whispers, not with their mouth, but directly into your mind, "It needs to be done *before* it's started."

Then the quicksand chair swallows you whole.
