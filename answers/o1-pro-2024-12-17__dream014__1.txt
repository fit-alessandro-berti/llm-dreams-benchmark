…and you can’t help but feel an unexpected sense of relief wash over you. Though your heart is still beating a bit too quickly, you follow these strangers through narrow, winding streets lit by hazy streetlamps. The cityscape looms overhead, tall buildings stitched together by blinking neon signs and mismatched balconies, yet their presence—their generosity—makes the overwhelming metropolis seem less intimidating.

One of the strangers, a woman with kind eyes and a gentle voice, points to a faded mural on a nearby wall. It depicts a flock of birds erupting skyward from a single cage, painted in bright colors that have begun to peel. She explains that this artwork serves as a compass for travelers who’ve lost their way. Another stranger, a towering man with broad shoulders, hands you a small wooden token carved into the shape of a bird. He says you’ll need it soon.

They guide you deeper into the heart of the city, down cramped alleys and around unexpected corners. With each turn, the bustle seems to soften. You begin to notice subtle markers you hadn’t before: a copper door knocker shaped like an owl’s head, a row of lampposts humming quietly in unison, a painted arrow pointing discreetly toward an archway. It’s as though the city itself is giving you clues, urging you forward.

Eventually, you reach a quiet courtyard, its stones worn smooth by countless footsteps. Overhead, strings of paper lanterns sway in a gentle breeze, casting warm, dancing shadows. In the middle stands a low, circular fountain. The group halts here and the kind-eyed woman steps forward, motioning you closer. She explains that this place is a threshold—on the other side lies the path that will lead you where you need to go. It won’t be easy, she tells you, and you must listen carefully.

She asks for the wooden bird token. When you hand it over, she dips it into the fountain’s cool, clear water. Instead of wetting the wood, the water seems to absorb into it, causing intricate patterns of feathers to glow faintly along the carved surface. She passes it back to you, and the token now feels alive in your hand—warm, pulsing gently, as if with a heartbeat all its own.

As you approach the opposite side of the courtyard, a tall archway shimmers into focus. On its surface are symbols you’ve never seen before, glyphs that remind you both of letters and tiny constellations. When you hold up the token, the symbols begin to shift, rearranging themselves until a path seems to emerge beyond the archway—a long street lined with lanterns leading toward a distant tower. You realize that’s where you need to go, though you’re not sure why yet.

You turn back to thank your guides, but they are already disappearing into the city’s darkened alleyways. You only catch the faintest echo of their voices, telling you to trust yourself, to let your heart and the token guide you. Alone now, but no longer feeling lost, you step through the archway and follow the lantern-lit path. Each step seems lighter than the last. You no longer feel the weight of loneliness or confusion—just a gentle curiosity and a growing belief that you will find what you seek.
