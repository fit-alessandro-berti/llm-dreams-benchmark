…you accept their help, and as you walk together through the unfamiliar streets, something shifts. The hurried faces around you slow down, almost imperceptibly, and the neon signs flicker in sync with your heartbeat. One of the strangers—an older woman with silver-rimmed glasses—taps the side of her tea cup. Inside, the amber liquid shows not steam, but miniature frames: images of *you* in moments you don’t yet remember.  

Another, a boy in a red cap, tilts his head and whispers, “The city’s rearranging itself for you.”  

The sidewalk beneath your shoes hums like a tuning fork. When you look down, the cracks between the slabs are filling with starlight. Each step rings out a note—C, E, G—that resolves into a melody you almost know. The strangers don’t walk in a straight line; they drift in a slow spiral, drawing you toward a hidden courtyard you’ve never seen yet somehow remember.  

At the center of the courtyard stands a single plum tree in blossom. Its petals fall upward, returning to the branches like moths drawn to light. One petal drifts onto your palm; it’s warm and pulse. Inside the petal, etched in vanishing ink, is an address you don’t need to read—because you already know it, the way you know how to breathe.  

The strangers smile, but they linger only long enough to let the city bend toward you. Then they dissolve into colors, not shapes, and the courtyard folds into a pocket of silence. You step forward, and the ground beneath your feet becomes a river of glass, carrying you silently to the building whose door you will open—and whose story will open in turn.
