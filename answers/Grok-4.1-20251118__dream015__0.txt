…despite the hardships, you decide to build a library.

Not a grand one (there’s no time for marble arches or stained glass), but something stubborn and alive. You start with the ruins of an old subway station, its tiled walls cracked but still standing. Every day you scavenge: a waterlogged paperback here, a child’s picture book wedged in a car door there, a singed encyclopedia volume that somehow still smells like a grandmother’s attic. You drag them back through streets where feral dogs follow at a distance and the wind sounds like someone whispering your name backward.

At night, under a ceiling half-collapsed into stars, you clean the pages with the hem of your shirt, patch spines with duct tape and hope, and stack them on shelves made from shopping carts welded together. You leave the entrance unmarked except for a single sign written in charcoal: WORDS STILL WORK.

People come slowly. First a girl with one eye who trades you three bullets for a battered copy of Anne of Green Gables. Then an old man who cries when he finds a book of piano music he once played for his wife (he sits right there on the concrete and hums the notes he can’t play anymore). Then a gang of teenagers who pretend they only want the medical manuals, but you catch them weeks later arguing over who gets to read the last Harry Potter next.

One evening a woman arrives carrying a baby wrapped in a radiation blanket. She hasn’t spoken in months, she signs with her free hand. You hand her a thin, bright board book about a hungry caterpillar. She opens it, touches the colorful pages like they might bite her, then presses the book to her chest and starts to sob without sound. The baby reaches for the pictures and laughs (a small, impossible sound in the quiet station).

You realize then that the library isn’t yours anymore. It never really was. It belongs to every person who walks down those broken escalators looking for proof that the world once made beauty on purpose, and might again.

Years later, when travelers ask how civilization started rebuilding, they’ll say it began with water purifiers or fortified settlements or the first safe harvest. But you’ll know the truth.

It started when someone decided that, even at the end of everything, stories were still worth carrying home.
