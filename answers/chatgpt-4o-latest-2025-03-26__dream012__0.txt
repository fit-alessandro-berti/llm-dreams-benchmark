grip the worn wooden rail of the quarterdeck, feeling the spray of saltwater sting your face. Lightning branches across the sky like cracks in the heavens themselves, and the wind screams in your ears, tearing at your coat. 

You lift your voice above the roar of thunder. "Hold fast, all of you! Reef the mainsail and secure the lines!" Your first mate, a wiry woman named Elira, nods and sprints across the deck, barking orders. The crew scurries like shadows beneath lanterns swaying wildly from the masts.

Your ship groans under the weight of the waves, her timbers protesting, but she doesn't break. She's old, like you — weathered but strong. The ocean swells rise like mountains around you, but your hands remain steady on the wheel.

And then, through the wall of rain, something emerges — shimmering, immense, not entirely real. An isle, floating just above the surface of the sea, wrapped in mists of gold and violet. You've seen it before… in stories told by old mariners, in the corners of maps everyone insists are decoration.

You blink, uncertain if it’s the lightning or your imagination… but it's there. The storm calms just enough to let the ship drift toward it. The nearer you get, the more the ocean itself seems to fall quiet. Your crew stares with wide eyes.

Elira returns to your side. “Captain,” she says, voice uncertain, “are we dreaming?”

You meet her gaze, then return your eyes to that impossible island. “Maybe,” you say. “But if we are, let's not wake up until we've touched the shore.” 

And the ship sails forward, toward something long lost — or never meant to be found.
