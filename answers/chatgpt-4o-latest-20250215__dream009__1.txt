find a way to blend in. The air is thick with the scent of earth and woodsmoke, and the people around you wear simple, handwoven garments. The streets are unpaved, bustling with merchants selling goods from wooden carts, and towering stone buildings cast long shadows under the early morning sun.

Your clothes feel out of place—soft fabrics and stitched seams that don’t match the rough linen tunics and leather sandals of the locals. You glance at a reflective surface in a nearby water trough and see a confused expression staring back at you. The language spoken around you is unfamiliar, but some words sound vaguely recognizable, as if you’ve heard them before in an old history book or a forgotten film.

Do you claim to be a foreigner from a distant province? A runaway slave seeking freedom? Or do you try to find a patron—someone powerful who might take you under their wing before the wrong people ask too many questions?

You take a deep breath and decide…
