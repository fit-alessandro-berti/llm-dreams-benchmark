...and you **feel a wave of relief so potent it almost brings tears to your eyes.** You try to explain where you're headed, the name of the street or the landmark you're seeking evaporating from your tongue like mist.

One of them, an older woman with eyes that seem to hold ancient starlight, simply smiles. "Don't worry about the destination, dear," she says, her voice like warm honey. "It's the journey with good company that matters."

They don't pull out a map or point down a specific street. Instead, they start walking, and you instinctively fall into step with them. The city around you begins to transform. The harsh angles of skyscrapers soften, glowing with an inner light. The cacophony of traffic morphs into a strange, beautiful symphony of wind chimes and distant whale song.

They lead you through alleyways that open into secret gardens filled with impossible, luminous flowers, and over bridges made of woven moonlight that span rivers of sparkling nebulae. You're not sure how much time passes – it could be minutes or eons. With every step, the feeling of being lost dissipates, replaced by a gentle curiosity and a profound sense of belonging.

Finally, you find yourselves standing before a simple, unassuming door tucked into the side of what looks like an ordinary bakery. The aroma of freshly baked bread, of cinnamon and something inexplicably comforting, wafts out.

"Here," one of the strangers says, a young man with a kind grin. "This is a good place to start again."

You feel a profound sense of peace, no longer lost, no longer alone. You thank them, their faces already beginning to shimmer and fade slightly, like figures in an old photograph. As you turn to open the door, you glance back, but they've vanished, as if they were never there, leaving only the scent of starlight and warm bread behind.

You open the door, ready for whatever comes next, the warmth from inside pulling you forward.
