**Dream Continuation:**

As you weave through the crowd, the hum of conversation and laughter swirls around you. The room is vast, with high ceilings and flickering chandeliers casting warm, shifting light. You spot a group near a grand fireplace, their faces animated as they debate something passionately. One of them—a woman with sharp, knowing eyes—locks onto you and smiles. "You look lost," she says, stepping closer. "Are you searching for someone?"

Before you can answer, a man in a tailored suit claps his hands, drawing the attention of the room. "Ladies and gentlemen," he announces, "the next game begins in five minutes. Partners, find each other!" The crowd erupts into movement, people pairing off or forming small teams. You glance around, realizing your one acquaintance might already be paired with someone else.

Then, a hand taps your shoulder. You turn to see a stranger with a mischievous grin. "You’re with me," they say, pressing a small, ornate key into your palm. "We’re on the same team now. Ready?"

The dream shifts—suddenly, you’re in a dimly lit hallway, doors lining either side. The stranger whispers, "We have to find the right one before the others do." The key feels heavy in your hand. The game has begun, but the rules are unclear. Do you trust this stranger? Or is there another path?
