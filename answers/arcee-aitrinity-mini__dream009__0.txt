Waking up in a completely different era is disorienting. The air smells different – not of exhaust fumes, but of woodsmoke and something earthy. Your phone is gone, replaced by the dull ache of unfamiliar muscles. You stand in a small, sun-drenched courtyard, surrounded by stone buildings with terracotta roofs that curve like ancient bowls. The clothes you wear are coarse wool, scratchy against your skin – not jeans and a t-shirt anymore.

You realize you need to **find shelter and food, but more urgently, you need to understand *where* and *when* you are, and *how* you might get home.**

Here's how the dream unfolds, with choices and consequences:

1.  **The Immediate Need: Shelter & Safety**
    *   The courtyard isn't private. You spot a narrow, arched doorway leading inside. A kind-faced woman in a simple dress gestures towards it from a window above. "Dove vai, signore?" (Where are you going, sir?).
    *   You try to gesture that you're lost and don't understand Italian. She smiles kindly, places a hand over her heart, and points to her own cottage door. She speaks slowly, "Soggiorno? Soggiorno?" (Lodging? Lodging?).
    *   **Choice:** Do you follow her into her home? (Risking intrusion but gaining immediate shelter) or stand in the doorway, uncertain? (Risking exposure but perhaps finding a less intrusive option elsewhere?).

2.  **The Critical Need: Understanding Your Situation**
    *   Once settled in a cramped but warm room, the woman (perhaps named Sofia) brings bread and cheese. She's curious about your clothes and asks, "Da dove venite? Non parlate bene l'italiano." (Where do you come from? You don't speak Italian well?).
    *   You try to explain, gesturing wildly at the sky, the distant mountains, the lack of machines. You mime the word "computer" by tapping a fist to your temple, then gesture at the sky like a satellite dish, failing utterly.
    *   Sofia seems puzzled but concerned. She whispers to her husband (Marco) about a "strano signore" (strange gentleman). He comes in, looks you over, and asks, "Ma come si chiama? Siete uomo o donna?" (What is your name? Are you a man or a woman?).
    *   **Choice:** How do you respond? Do you give your name (which will likely sound ridiculous in the 15th century, like "Thomas" or "Elizabeth")? Do you try to insist you belong somewhere else, using gestures and frantic pointing?

3.  **The Hidden Need: Deciphering the "Mystery"**
    *   While trying to communicate, your eye catches something unusual. A heavy, wooden chest in the corner, slightly open. Inside, wrapped in cloth, is an object that looks *incredibly* out of place: a small, modern-looking USB flash drive, still glowing faintly with a charge, resting on a pile of old, dusty documents.
    *   **Choice:** Do you:
        *   **Panic and try to hide it?** You shove it back, hoping no one noticed the slight rustle or the unnatural glow under the cloth. Your heart races. What if they find it? You *need* that data.
        *   **Try to explain its importance?** You carefully remove it, hold it up, and try to mime "machine" and "memory," tapping the drive against your temple again, perhaps pointing wildly at the documents and back to the drive. "Dati! Dati!" (Data! Data!).
        *   **Leave it be, but keep a close eye on it?** You put it back, but now you're hyper-aware of who might look in that chest. This object might be the key to your situation or a dangerous liability.

**The Dream Continues:**

The choices you make in this moment shape your next steps. Did you gain shelter by trusting Sofia? Are you seen as a mad man or an eccentric noble? Did you find the mysterious drive? Is it a clue, or a beacon for unseen forces?

*   **If you hid the drive:** You might live under an assumed identity, but the drive sits hidden, a constant temptation and source of paranoia. Someone *might* investigate the chest later.
*   **If you tried to explain the drive:** You've labeled yourself as truly "other," perhaps a magician, a devil, or a prophet. You've gained the attention of Marco, who is practical and cautious. He might report you to the local constable, or offer you a grimmer form of shelter. The drive could attract unwanted attention or become a bargaining chip.
*   **If you left it but watched it:** You're constantly on edge. You see Sofia's husband take the chest to be repaired or stored securely. Do you follow? Do you try to retrieve it later? Is the drive a trap or a tool?

**What do you need to do *next*?** Do you try to explore the village more deeply, risking discovery? Do you try to understand the local power structures to avoid trouble? Do you focus on deciphering the drive's contents, hoping it holds the map home? Or are you starting to accept this might be your reality? The dream hangs on your immediate choices.
