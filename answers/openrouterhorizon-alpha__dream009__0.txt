…learn the rules of this world before it decides the rules for you.

The light is different here—thicker, like it’s made of dust and patience. You stand up, knees stiff from a straw-stuffed mattress, and step into a street of cracked clay and sun-bleached wood. There are no wires overhead, no hum of compressors, just a chorus of cart wheels, goats, and voices carrying news the way wind carries seeds.

Your hands itch to reach for a phone that isn’t there. Your pockets offer only lint, a button, and a small pebble smooth as a thought. You put the pebble in your mouth like a promise and start walking.

You need to learn the water first. Where it comes from, what it costs. You follow the river of people to a square with a stone basin, women drawing buckets with arms like braided rope. You offer to carry; your back remembers the shape of labor it forgot in the old world. They watch you the way one watches a stray dog: with sympathy edged by caution. The oldest woman points with her chin to a hand pump and says a word that sounds like “share.” You nod in the language that lives in shoulders and wrists, and you share.

You need to learn the food second. A bread the size of your hand that snaps like a twig and tastes like sunlight on stone. A stew that smokes your eyes and warms the forgotten corridors of your stomach. You trade a day’s worth of sweeping a courtyard for a bowl and a place by the fire. The ash paints your shins. The smoke paints your voice. You listen more than you speak, collecting words like seeds, rolling them in your mouth until they sprout.

You need to learn the names of things—of winds and laws and geographies that do not exist where you came from. A man with silver in his beard and knuckles like walnuts teaches you knots in exchange for melodies you barely remember. You give him a song about trains. He doesn’t know what a train is, but he knows the rhythm of leaving and the refrain of return. He calls it a river trapped in an iron riverbed. You accept the new name and it accepts you.

Nights are long in this era. Stars come out with a confidence you’ve only seen in children. You lie beneath them and practice the constellations like vocabulary. Here, the hunter is a fisherman. Here, the bear is a cradle. Here, the North is wherever someone says “home.”

You need to learn the dangers, too. Which quarter you don’t cross after dark. Which color means plague. Which smile means bargain and which means debt. You learn to wrap your feet in cloth before boots. You learn to keep a piece of charcoal tucked behind your ear because the world keeps asking you to draw maps no one else can see.

Time moves sideways. Weeks become the length of a cup cooling in your hands. You fix fences. You mend a broken wheel. You laugh when a donkey refuses to move for any reason that makes sense and then watches you like a philosopher. You become the kind of person who has a favorite kind of rope.

On a market day, a traveling scribe opens a case of paper that smells like rain and promises. You touch a sheet and feel it thrumming, as if it recognizes you. The scribe asks, “What do you carry from the age you lost?”

You think of glass that glows. You think of voices that arrive without bodies. You think of a library that fit in your pocket and the way it sometimes made you forget your hands. You think of loneliness threaded through convenience, and how convenience ate the rituals that used to stitch days together.

“Recipes,” you say slowly. “For making light from friction. For making disinfectant from ash and patience. For stitching wounds so the skin remembers itself. For telling true stories when the truth is shy.”

The scribe smiles like a door opening. “Then write.”

You need to learn how to teach without preaching. You start small: a better lever for the well, a soap that keeps birthbeds safer, a way to measure time with a shadow and a nail. You trade one miracle for three chores. People trust what they can fix themselves.

There are whispers—there always are. Some call you a visitor with pockets full of tomorrows. Some call you a fool who knows the name of every star but not the price of salt. Both are true on different days.

You wake before dawn to the sound of rain on clay. Your hands ache the honest ache of purpose. You step outside and lift your face to the weather. The square glistens. The basin overflows. Children splash your shins and run, leaving laughter like string behind them. Someone has tied a ribbon to your door. It means you are included in a festival you barely understand. You go anyway.

At the feast, you teach them a game with stones. Someone teaches you a blessing that tastes like honey and smoke. There are stories as long as roads. You offer yours: a dream of a far-off time where people carried fires in their pockets and misplaced their shadows. They listen like people who know that time is a wheel with more spokes than anyone can count.

When the moon is high enough to hang its feet in the trees, you realize you no longer reach for the phantom weight of a phone. You reach for a neighboring hand, for a jug, for the old woman’s nod, for the scribe’s pen. The era does not feel like a cage anymore. It feels like a language you are finally fluent in enough to dream in.

You needed to learn how to live without the future so you could give this present one, small, durable gift at a time. And the gift came back to you in bread, in names, in ribbons, in rain.

Eventually, you will wake again. You always do. But before you go, you carve a little mark beneath the bench where the square becomes the street. It is not your name; it is the shape of the pebble you still carry. If anyone asks what it means, they will be told: It is the sign of someone who arrived empty and left instructions for how to make enough.
