...and you look down at your desk, but instead of your familiar computer and keyboard, there's a single, slightly damp, oversized sock. This is your "project kit."

Your boss, whose face now seems to be subtly shifting, like a badly tuned hologram, leans in. "The client needs this sock... *optimised*," he booms, his voice echoing slightly as if you're both at the bottom of a well. "By teatime!"

You stare at the sock. It's grey, lumpy, and smells faintly of cheese and despair. "Optimised... how?" you stammer, your own voice a distant squeak.

"Precisely!" he beams, though his smile doesn't quite reach his eyes, which are now slowly rotating in opposite directions. "That's what we pay you the big bucks for!" He claps you on the shoulder, but his hand feels strangely like a bundle of wet twigs.

You pick up the sock. It's heavier than it looks. As you turn it over, tiny, glowing runes appear on its surface, pulsing with a faint, unsettling light. Your colleagues are all suddenly wearing identical sock-shaped hats, humming a tune that sounds suspiciously like the "Imperial March" played on kazoos.

The deadline isn't just impossible; it's incomprehensible. You glance at the clock on the wall. The hands are spinning wildly, and the numbers are all an unfamiliar hieroglyphic script. Teatime could be in five minutes or five centuries.

You take a deep breath, trying to channel your inner sock-optimisation expert (a role you didn't know existed until this moment). You decide the sock needs... more flair? You rummage in your drawer, which is now filled with glitter, googly eyes, and a single, very determined-looking earthworm wearing a tiny construction hat.

"Right," you mumble, picking up the earthworm. "Operation Sock Optimisation is a go." The earthworm gives a tiny, enthusiastic wiggle. The sock on your desk twitches. This is going to be a long dream.
