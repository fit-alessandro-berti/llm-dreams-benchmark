You start to ask passers-by for help, but every time you open your mouth the words come out in a language nobody recognizes (backwards, maybe, or something that sounds like wind chimes being dropped down stairs). People smile politely and keep walking, their faces flickering like bad television reception.

The streets themselves are restless. One moment you’re on a wide boulevard lined with impossible skyscrapers made of mirrored glass; the next, the pavement tilts and you’re sliding downhill into a narrow alley where the buildings lean so close overhead that only a thin ribbon of bruised-purple sky remains. Street signs keep rewriting themselves when you’re not looking directly at them. “Rue de l’Horloge” becomes “You’re Late Avenue” becomes “This Way (no, the other way)”.

Your phone is in your hand but the screen shows only a live feed of your own panicked face, distorted like a funhouse mirror, mouthing words you’re not saying. Battery: 99%. Time: always 59 minutes until the meeting.

Eventually you spot a small café with warm amber light spilling onto the cobblestones. Inside, every table is occupied by a version of you (some older, some younger, one with antlers made of subway maps). They all nurse the same cup of coffee and glance up as you enter. The nearest one, wearing the exact clothes you have on right now, slides a brass key across the table.

“You’ll need this,” he says, voice perfectly synced with yours. “The meeting isn’t in a place. It’s in a when.”

You take the key. It’s warm, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat. When you look up to ask what he means, the café is empty except for a single ticking clock on the wall that has no hands. The second hand is racing backward.

You step outside and the city has rearranged itself into a gigantic clockwork plaza. Streets radiate out like spokes; bridges arch overhead like hour markers. At the center stands a door floating three feet off the ground, no walls attached—just a free-standing door made of dark wood and stained glass that shows tomorrow’s weather.

The key fits perfectly.

You turn it. The door swings inward onto a small, dimly lit boardroom. A long table. Eight empty chairs. And one seat already occupied—by you, calm and collected, wearing a suit you don’t own yet, checking a watch that reads exactly one minute past the meeting’s start time.

Dream-you looks up and smiles the way someone does when they’ve been waiting their whole life for you to finally show up late to your own beginning.

“Take a seat,” they say gently. “We have a lot to go over before you wake up and forget you were ever in charge.”
