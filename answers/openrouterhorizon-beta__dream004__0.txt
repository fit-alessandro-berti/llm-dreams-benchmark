you feel it tugging at you, like a door you can walk through. When you touch it, your fingers sink in as if the surface is warm water. Ripples of cerulean and gold spread outward, and suddenly the canvas steals your shadow and turns it into a flock of birds. They lift off your feet with a soft thunder, their wings folding into triangles, then opening as ribbons that braid themselves into a horizon.

A paintbrush appears in your hand, though you don’t remember picking it up. Or maybe it remembers picking you. Its bristles drink light, humming like a small, satisfied animal. You reach out and draw a single, hesitant line. It curves away from you, laughing, and becomes a road paved with piano keys. When you step onto it, the notes spring beneath your weight and play the names of the colors you’ve forgotten since childhood.

Around you, the world slides like a kaleidoscope finding a new truth. Mountains assemble themselves from broken teacups and windowpanes. A distant city breathes in and out, its towers bending like reeds, exhaling a breeze that smells faintly of rain and old libraries. The sky peels open to reveal a second sky beneath it, greener and closer, where clouds keep their secrets scribbled on the undersides.

On the canvas, you paint a door with a brass handle shaped like a question mark. When you turn it, the door swings wide and you step through—not into a room, but into the thought of a room, a place outlined in chalk on midnight. Furniture sketches itself in: a chair that sighs when you sit, a clock that remembers tomorrow before it remembers yesterday. Time puddles at your feet, and when you touch it, your fingertips come away glittering with seconds.

You decide to paint a companion, because in dreams you can invite anything to meet you. A figure emerges in careful strokes: a person composed of negative space, wearing a jacket cut from constellations and eyes that hold a familiar awkward kindness. They tilt their head, listening to a song you can’t hear yet, and say your name without using their mouth. You realize they are an echo you left somewhere long ago and forgot to collect.

“Where are we going?” they ask, and the question becomes a hallway. You walk down it together. Doors bloom on either side: one opens onto your grandmother’s kitchen, where oranges roll like suns across the table; another opens onto an ocean that rises only as far as your knees and stays there, patient as a dog. A third door opens onto night itself, blank and soft. You close it, pocketing a handful of stars for later.

At the end of the hallway, there’s a mirror. It doesn’t show you what you look like now; it shows the shape of your footsteps, the map of all the places where you almost turned back and didn’t. Your companion touches the glass and it ripples. From the mirror spills a field of tall grass, each blade a different shade of memory. You walk into it until the grass is taller than your shoulders. Fireflies drift up around you, blinking in a language you almost understand. You answer by drawing a circle in the air. The circle becomes a moon and climbs into the sky, tugging the tide of silence higher.

When dawn arrives—it arrives sideways, like a book sliding from a shelf—you discover that the canvas has followed you, trailing behind like a loyal kite. It has recorded everything: the piano road, the library wind, the constellation jacket, the patient ocean. It waits for one last stroke. You dip the brush into your heartbeat. The color is something between crimson and courage.

You paint an open window.

A breeze passes through the newly made space and fills your lungs. The world beyond the frame glows with the impossible softness of first light. Your companion steps toward it and pauses, turning back to meet your eyes. Their smile is an answer you didn’t know you were asking for. Together, you climb through the window and fall—not down, but forward—into a garden where every blossom is a possible day, and every path is the next word in a sentence you’re still writing, even as you wake.
