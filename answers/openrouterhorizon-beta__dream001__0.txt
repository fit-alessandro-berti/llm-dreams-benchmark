…walk, then jog, then run, hoping memory will snap into place. The streets are wider than they need to be, as if waiting for parades that never come. Buildings tilt slightly inward, their windows watching. Every corner you turn becomes the corner you just left. Your watch ticks loudly, an exaggerated metronome. Fifty-two minutes.

You stop a passerby to ask for directions, but their face is a collage of others you’ve known: your teacher’s eyes, your neighbor’s mouth, your childhood friend’s laugh stitched into their greeting. They point helpfully—to three different streets at once. “It’s that way,” they say in three voices. You choose the middle.

The city rearranges itself to accommodate you. Street signs are sentences: Regret Avenue intersects With What You Meant To Say. The bus stops whisper destinations like promises: The Office You Forgot, The Elevator That Never Comes, The Place That Was Yours. Your phone unlocks to a calendar that swipes away from your finger. Forty-one minutes.

You duck into a café to ask for an address, and the bell above the door chimes your name—first name, middle name, last name—like a roll call. The barista scribbles on a napkin, drawing a map that spirals inward like a snail shell. “Follow the curve until the center,” they say. “But don’t look at the center.” You take the napkin and, as you step outside, the café is already a laundromat, already a florist, already gone.

You follow the map. The streets curve obediently, the buildings soften, the sky lowers until it feels like a ceiling you could press with your palm. Your feet know where to go, the way feet remember bicycle pedals after years. Thirty minutes. You pass a mirrored window and your reflection is arriving from the opposite direction, out of breath, clutching the same napkin. You exchange a nod like conspirators.

Ahead, a plaza opens like a held breath. In its center stands a clocktower whose face is missing the twelve. Where the twelve should be is a small doorway. The map has reached its center. The napkin warns you without words. Don’t look. You look anyway, briefly—only to confirm the warning—and see a flash: an empty chair, a nameplate with no name, a microphone tilted toward absence. The doorway is smaller than you expected. You have to stoop.

Inside, the hallway is carpeted with calendar pages, soft and crinkling. Doors line the corridor, each labeled with what you didn’t write down: “The Thing You Swore You’d Remember,” “The Person You Mean To Call,” “The Appointment That Moves Itself.” You open one at random and find a conference room with a lake in the center. People in suits row across it in office chairs. They wave their clipboards like flags. “You’re late,” they call. “You’re early,” they call. “You’re right on time,” echoes softly from under the water.

You close the door and the handles move beneath your fingers like fish. Twenty minutes. Someone at the end of the hall holds a placard with your name on it. You hurry, relieved, and they turn it around. The other side is blank. “Right this way,” they say without moving. When you reach them, they step aside to reveal an elevator. Its buttons are seasons, not floors. You press “Late Summer” because it feels forgiving.

The elevator doors close reluctantly, like lips about to confess. Muzak plays the tune of something you used to hum when you were small, though you can’t name it. The numbers above the door abandon counting in favor of adjectives: Soon, Sooner, Sooner Still, Almost. The doors open to a room full of chairs, each occupied by a version of you—nervous you, confident you, you in a shirt you don’t own, you with a haircut you thought of getting. They all look up as one.

“Finally,” they say in your voice. The table at the front is set with notebooks that already contain your handwriting. The agenda reads: 1) Why you came. 2) What you already know. 3) What you keep forgetting. The chair at the head of the table is empty. You try to sit there, but all the other yous clear their throats politely until you choose a seat at the side.

An older you slides a document across. “We’ve been waiting to tell you,” they say. The paper is warm like skin. It’s a map of the city, but now it’s a heart: alleys as veins, parks as atria, the river a patient pulse. A path is highlighted from where you began to here. “You bring us here every time,” another you adds, the one with ink on their fingers. “To remind yourself.” The agenda’s second item ticks itself off with a small, satisfied whisper.

You glance at your watch. Ten minutes. The room sways with the pulse of the map. “I still don’t know where the meeting is,” you say, and all the yous smile the same crooked, sympathetic smile.

“This is the meeting,” says a you who looks most like you feel. “This is where you remember that you won’t be given an address. You choose one. If you choose it, it becomes true.” They stand and gesture to the empty chair at the head. “Or you can keep running. Both are honest.”

You look at the chair. It looks at you back in the way furniture does in dreams. The door behind you opens and a breeze skims across all your forearms at once. There is city in that breeze: hot pavement, rain about to start, the last sentence of a shouted conversation.

You stand. The napkin map is folded in your hand. It has become a paper crane without your noticing. You set it on the table. “Fine,” you say, surprising yourself with softness. “I choose here.”

The crane tilts its head. The clocktower outside clears its throat. Your watch hands both point toward you like accusations that feel like absolutions. The yous around you nod and begin to fade, not dramatically, but as if they’ve remembered somewhere else they need to be.

You take the seat at the head of the table. The microphone hums awake, not to announce you but to listen. You lean in.

“Meeting called to order,” you say, and the whole city leans closer to hear what you’re about to decide.
