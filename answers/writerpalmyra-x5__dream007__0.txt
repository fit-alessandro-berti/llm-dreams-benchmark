...decide to take a walk together through the old city, even though it's raining. Neither of you brought jackets, but the argument has warmed you enough that you barely notice. The cobblestones glisten under flickering gas lamps, and somehow—without either of you saying it—you both turn toward the bridge where you used to skip stones as kids. You stop in the middle, shoulders damp, voices softening. One of you says, “Remember when we swore we’d build a treehouse right here and live in it forever?” And just like that, the tension cracks. Not because the issue is solved, but because you both realize the friendship has always been the ground beneath your feet, not just the thing caught in the storm. So you stand there, two stubborn, soaking ghosts of your younger selves, deciding maybe it's okay to not have all the answers—just as long as you’re looking for them together. What made you think of this moment?
