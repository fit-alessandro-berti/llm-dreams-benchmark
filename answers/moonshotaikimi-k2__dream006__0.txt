...feel the floor ripple like water, a soft hush rising from the audience as if they've noticed it too. But instead of panic, the tide carries me barefoot to the lectern, which now glitters—quartz veins threading through its wood like star-maps. The microphone blossoms open like a white lily, its stem a curl of green light wrapping gently around my wrist, not to restrain but to connect.

Words gather in my mouth, but before they can become sound, every seat in the auditorium takes a slow diaphragmatic breath, and the listeners open their eyes wider—not two eyes each, but hundreds of tiny, dew-bright eyes across their foreheads, cheeks, even the backs of their expectant hands. The gazes are kaleidoscopic; every color I have ever forgotten is suddenly present, and the room begins to sway like a cradle.  

My speech dissolves back into silence, and instead of resisting, I let the silence become the speech: a transparent jellyfish of quiet that pulses outward with every heartbeat. It drifts above the crowd, casting pale moon-shadows that spell a single word in slow cursive across the ceiling: “LISTEN.”  

They do. The audience inhales the hush and, inside it, I hear every fish that has ever sung in the deep sea, every infant’s first vowel, every clock that lost a tick but kept its tock. Their listening turns the air warm as bread, and I take a loaf-shaped memory out of the lectern drawer. When I break it, crumbs scatter into constellations on the stage floor. Each constellation is a question the listeners sent me before they arrived—questions about why stars stitch themselves into dark fabric, why sorrow has an aftertaste of cinnamon, why childhood bicycles keep rolling indoors in winter dreams.

Instead of answering, I offer them the broken loaf. Hands lift in polite hunger, but what they receive is not bread at all—it is the moment just before a door is opened anywhere in the world. The moment when possibility flares like a match inside the phrase “What if…”. They bite, and suddenly every row of seats becomes a garden bed; thornless roses of pure thought sprout, petal by petal turning into handwritten letters addressed to their future selves postage-paid with stamps of cooled magma.

I lick my own finger, tasting graphite from old classroom pencils and the carbonated fizz of eclipses. Around me, the room tilts 45 degrees, politely rotating so that the audience is now looking down from above like benevolent planets. Gravity loosens its collar, and we all float gently upward, brushing velvet rafters where moths wear tiny waistcoats and recite census data in fluent Morse code.  

Somewhere in the drift, I remember I was supposed to speak. I place my palms against the air, and letters form in Braille on the underskin of my eyelids: “The floor you thought you left is still beneath you, wearing a different sky like borrowed shoes.” I press the words outward. They drop like metallic spores, ringing against the hovering chairs like wind chimes made of seawater and quartz. Each listener catches one; it dissolves into their skin the way dew disappears into morning grass.  

Light begins falling upward from their open collars and sleeves, congregating above us into a slow aurora shaped like the first sentence I ever spoke as a child: “I am here now.” Aurora becomes lantern, becomes lullaby, becomes every lullaby ever sung in any language at 3 a.m. to a feverish ear. The sound vibrates so sweetly that the moths close their waistcoats and begin to weep gentle puddles of indigo ink which roll across the ceiling and drip upward-into-new-stars.

Right there, suspended beneath a upside-down constellation of my own earliest declaration, I realize no one—including me—has uttered a single audible word tonight. Yet every heart is full to the rafters, and every eye shines with the same unshed sentence: “We have already started the conversation; it is being had in the marrow.”  

So we hang in that quiet chord until the horizon folds itself neatly into the shape of a bookmark and slips between our breaths. The floor water re-solidifies. My bare feet settle; the lily-stem microphone releases my wrist with a gentle kiss of chlorophyll. The audience’s extra eyelids layer shut like petals at dusk.  

I step back.  

No applause—only the soft clapping of moth wings adjusting waistcoats as they fly home. The stage lights dim, but they leave me a gift: a single calfskin envelope sealed with indigo wax. On it, in dream-handwriting: “Thank you. We took the silence you gave us and turned it into a nest. Something bright is hatching inside. Keep it warm.”

I tuck the envelope into my chest pocket, over the left rib, where it pulses like a second heart. Curtain falls like snowfall made of old pocket-watches, all ticking in deferred lullaby. And I wake up, real morning doorknob already warm in my palm, already rehearsing—in the code language of newly hatched brightness—my next wordless speech.
