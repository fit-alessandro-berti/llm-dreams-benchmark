*steps forward, feeling the warm spotlight on my face*

...begin to speak, and my voice emerges not as words but as *colors*—ribbons of deep indigo and gold spiraling out toward the audience. They seem unsurprised. Of course. This is how speeches work.

I look down at my notes and they're written in a language I've never seen but completely understand. Something about \the migration patterns of forgotten memories.\

The audience members are nodding, but I notice their faces keep... shifting. My third-grade teacher becomes my dentist becomes someone I'm certain I've never met but who feels deeply familiar.

I'm suddenly aware I'm not wearing shoes. The stage floor is warm grass now.

\And in conclusion,\ myself saying—though I hadn't planned a conclusion—\ doors we never opened remain the most *open* of all.\ audience erupts in applause that sounds like rain on a tin roof. A standing ovation. Someone in the front row is crying and mouthing *thank you*.

I bow, and when I rise, I'm somehow in the back of the auditorium, watching myself still at the podium, beginning the speech again.

I think I did well? I'm not entirely sure what I said, but it felt *true*.

*the edges begin to soften...*
