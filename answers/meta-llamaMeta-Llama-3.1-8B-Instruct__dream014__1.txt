...follow them through the winding streets, pausing at street corners and crossing busy intersections, as they expertly navigate the crowded sidewalks. They ask me about my destination, and when I struggle to remember, they simply smile and say, "Don't worry, we'll get you there."

One of them, a young woman with bright pink hair, takes my hand and leads me through a narrow alleyway between two towering skyscrapers. The sounds of the city melt away, replaced by the hum of fluorescent lights overhead and the faint scent of street food wafting from a nearby cart.

As we walk, they ask me questions about myself, and I feel a sense of vulnerability wash over me, but somehow, with their gentle probing, I start to open up. They listen intently, offering words of encouragement and understanding, and I begin to feel a weight lift off my shoulders.

The group takes me to a small, quaint park amidst the steel and concrete of the city. We sit down on a bench beneath a blooming cherry blossom tree, and one of the strangers pulls out a sketchbook and begins to draw a intricate map of the city. As he draws, he points out hidden gems and secret spots that only the locals know about, and I feel a sense of wonder wash over me.

One of the strangers, a tall, lanky man with a kind smile, hands me a cup of steaming hot coffee, and I wrap my hands around it, feeling a sense of comfort and contentment. For the first time in what feels like hours, I feel like I'm exactly where I need to be.

As we sit there, the city grid system melting away into the tiny, intimate spaces of the park, I start to realize that I wasn't lost after all. I was just stuck in the noise and chaos of the city, and these kind strangers were helping me find my way back to myself.
