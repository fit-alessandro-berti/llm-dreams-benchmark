I can engage with your dream scenario while recognizing it's just an imaginative exercise. Here's how I might envision the dream continuing:

...decide to take a deep breath and try a completely different approach. Suddenly, in that surreal way that only happens in dreams, we find ourselves transported to a peaceful garden where our words become visible, floating in the air like colorful butterflies. Each harsh word appears as a dark, heavy butterfly while kind words manifest as bright, luminous ones. 

Seeing our argument literally take shape in the air makes us both pause. We watch as the dark butterflies begin weighing down the flowers around us, while the few gentle words we'd spoken create small patches of light. In that strange dream-logic moment, we both understand without speaking that we can choose which kind of butterflies to create.

The scene shifts, and now we're sitting on clouds, looking down at our earlier selves arguing. From this new perspective, the thing we were fighting about seems much smaller, almost comically so...

Would you like me to continue with how this dream might unfold?
