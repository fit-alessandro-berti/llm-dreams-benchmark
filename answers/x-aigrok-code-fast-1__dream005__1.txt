In the hazy glow of twinkling fairy lights, the crowd pulses like a living thing, voices weaving into a cacophony of laughter and clinking glasses. Shadows dance across the walls, and the air smells of perfume and spilled wine. You weave through clusters of strangers: first, a circle of elegantly dressed elites trading stock tips, their laughter sharp as glass; they eye you suspiciously, mistaking you for an intruder, but one shrugs and points vaguely toward the balcony, saying, "They'll find you if you're meant for this party."

Pushing on, you stumble into a group of younger folks swaying to invisible music, their faces blurred and shifting like smoke—friends from forgotten parties, perhaps? They grin vacantly, offering cryptic advice: "In dreams like these, the seeker becomes the sought," one whispers before fading into mist. Frustration builds as the room spins; the floor tilts subtly, making every step a gamble.

Then, amidst a throng of masquerade masks and swirling gowns, you spot a familiar silhouette emerging from the fray. It's them—your one known face, bathed in soft moonlight filtering through arched windows. Relief washes over you like cool water, but as you reach out to touch their shoulder, the world glitches: the gathering dissolves into islands of floating tables, the crowd dissipating like fog. You're alone now, or so it seems, until a voice—yours?—echoes from nowhere: "Waking waits." The dream frays at the edges, pulling you toward consciousness.
