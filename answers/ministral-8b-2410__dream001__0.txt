walk down the bustling streets, the cityscape a mix of modern skyscrapers and historic architecture. The sun is setting, casting long, dancing shadows. You notice a group of people huddled around a street vendor selling steaming bowls of noodles. The aroma is enticing, but you remind yourself of the meeting.

You ask a nearby passerby for directions, but they speak a language you don't understand. You try to gesture, but they simply smile and shake their head. Frustrated, you decide to take a chance and follow the crowd.

The crowd leads you to a large, ornate building with columns and a grand entrance. It's the kind of place you'd expect a meeting like this to be held. You rush in, breathless and disheveled, but the guards at the door don't seem to notice or care.

Inside, the building is surprisingly quiet. You find a receptionist, who again speaks a language you can't understand. You show her your watch, pointing at the hour. She looks confused but hands you a map of the building.

The map is in a different language too, but you can make out a few familiar words. You recognize the meeting room from the map, but it's on the top floor. You start to walk, the echo of your footsteps the only sound in the vast, marble hallway.

As you ascend the grand staircase, you notice a small, peculiar statue on a pedestal. It's a woman with wings, holding a book. You reach out to touch it, and suddenly, the statue comes to life.

The woman with wings smiles at you. "I've been waiting for you," she says, her voice like music. "I am the dreamwalker. You are here because you need guidance."

She hands you a small, glowing orb. "This will help you find your way. And remember, in dreams, anything is possible."

You thank her, and she nods, fading away as quickly as she appeared. You look at the orb, and suddenly, you know exactly where to go. You follow the orb's light down the hallway, through the grand room, and up a series of winding staircases.

Finally, you reach the meeting room. The door is open, and your meeting attendees are waiting inside. They look confused, but as you enter, they all smile and welcome you. You take your seat at the head of the table, the orb now a small, soft light in your hand.

As you start the meeting, you realize that you're not just dreaming anymore. You're in control. And the city, the building, the people - they're all part of your dream. You can do anything you want here. And with that realization, you lean back in your chair, ready to make this meeting, and this dream, exactly as you want it to be.
