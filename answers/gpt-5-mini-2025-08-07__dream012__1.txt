and you find your hands already at the wheel before your mind has finished deciding. The deck pitches under your boots like the back of some great animal; rain hammers the canvas and the rigging sings a thin, metallic note. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you speak because speech is what steadies you—short orders, a coach of calm: "Shorten sails. Lash the fore. Hold the lee!" Your voice is an anchor. Even through the thunder you hear it, a small, solid thing that threads through the chaos and ties your people to one another.

The compass on the binnacle wobbles and then turns true, as if acknowledging the steadiness in your tone. You watch faces—young, old, features flattened by salt—lift toward you and find their courage. A boy you don't remember enlisting cheers, something bright and ridiculous in his shout that makes you laugh, which makes the man by the mast laugh, and for a half breath the sea answers with a silence so complete it could be mistaken for mercy.

But the storm is not only outside; it seeps into you. Memory is a leak in the hull. Names you meant to forgive rise in spray. A harbor lost, a voice carried away on a last tide. For a moment you fear you will steer by regret and that the ship will founder on the shoals of old decisions. Then the wheel becomes not wood and rope but a cool, steady locus at the center of your chest. You feel the crew as currents—each shove of a thumb, each knot tied, each shout a tide you can ride or resist.

Out of the thunder the horizon unfolds a new thing: lightning that does not scar the sky but opens it, like a seam unzipping. Through that seam a strip of night is visible and in that strip a single star burns, not like a far-away fire but like a lantern held on the shore of a different world. Without thinking, you bring the bow toward that light. The storm claws at you, trying to devour the notion, but the crew trusts the motion and answers with rhythm—pull, trim, brace. The ship moves as one organ, breath drawn and released in long strokes.

As you near the seam the sea changes. Foam becomes written ink, the waves lap in phrases you almost understand—advice, accusation, consolation. One crest takes the shape of an old map whose outlines are of choices you didn't make; another is a clock whose hands run sideways. A whale—massive, silver-eyed—surfaces and regards you with the slow dignity of things that remember the world's beginning. You meet its gaze and, absurdly, it nods before it sinks. You take that as permission.

When the seam opens fully, it is not an exit but a doorway: a harbor that should not exist, paved with glass and salt, houses whose windows glow with the faces of people you loved and left waiting on other shores. The lighthouse there does not sweep but hums, like a throat clearing to speak. You could anchor and claim this place, bind your crew to safety and never learn what lies beyond another horizon. You could follow the currents back and forget the seam as a feverish dream.

You make a different choice. You give a single order—soft, absolute—"Steady her. Follow my lead." Then you unhook yourself from the wheel for a breath and step out onto the bow, letting the spray baptize you. Wind strips away the last of the old maps. Standing there, you are both smaller than the storm and larger than fear. You steer not by the compass or the seam but by a light inside you that knows center and course. Your crew—your parts, your past, your present—falls in line, trusting that you will not lead them to ruin but through.

The ship answers. The storm, having spent itself on your resolve, begins to fold and retreat like a tide that has run its course. The seam closes as gently as a lid on a box. The sea quiets to a low, expectant breath. Somewhere, gulls laugh; somewhere else, a bell tolls the hour of a life remade.

You wake with the taste of salt on your tongue and the impression of wet rope in your palms. For a moment you can't tell if the deck beneath you was real, but you know the steadiness remains. You sit up, heart loud as thunder and steady as the wheel—still the captain, even on shore, and ready for the next weather.
