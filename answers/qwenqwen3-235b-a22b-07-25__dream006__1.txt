...speak—but no words come out. Your throat tightens, as if filled with cotton, and the carefully memorized opening line dissolves like smoke. Panic flickers at the edges of your vision, and you glance down at your notes, only to find the pages are blank, the paper smooth and empty except for faint watercolor smudges that shift into unfamiliar symbols.

The audience remains silent, but their faces begin to blur—features melting into soft edges, eyes glowing faintly like distant stars. The stage beneath your feet feels less solid now, more like the surface of a pond, slightly rippling with each breath you take.

Then, from the back of the hall, a single hand claps.

It’s slow. Deliberate. And suddenly, everyone stands—rising not in judgment, but in unison, like a field of wheat bending to the same wind. One by one, they begin to speak, not to you, but *for* you. Their voices weave together into a single, resonant voice that carries the words you couldn’t say—your thoughts, your fears, your hopes—spoken not with mockery, but with understanding.

You realize you’re not alone. The speech was never yours to carry by yourself.

And as the words fill the air like light, the stage dissolves beneath you—not into nothing, but into a trail of floating letters that rise like fireflies, guiding you forward, not toward an end, but into a new beginning you hadn’t imagined was possible.
