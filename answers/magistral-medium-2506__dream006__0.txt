...speak with confidence, your voice steady and clear. But as you look down at your notes, the words begin to blur and melt away like ink in water. You try to continue, but your mind goes blank—your thoughts are tangled, and your mouth feels dry. The crowd’s murmurs grow louder, whispering like a rising tide. Panic tightens your chest, and suddenly, your body feels heavy, as if you’re sinking into the stage itself. The floor beneath you begins to ripple like water, and before you can react, you’re falling—falling—

Then, you wake up with a gasp.

...Or do you?
