In the skeletal remains of a once-thriving city, I decide to *build a solar-powered water filtration garden* for my community. Though the world has crumbled, I turn to learning new technologies and nurturing relationships with those who once thrived. Together, we’ll protect what remains.  

*The dream ends with hope, as I carry the seeds of resilience and the future we’ve begun to build.*
