### The Evolving Storm

You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and hear the distant rumble of thunder echoing through the trees. The air grows heavy, charged with electricity, as dark clouds swirl overhead, blotting out the sun. Leaves rustle violently in the wind, and you quicken your pace, seeking shelter beneath a massive oak.

As rain begins to pelt the forest floor, you notice something odd—a glowing portal forms in the trunk of the tree. Your curiosity pulls you toward it just as lightning illuminates the path. Touching the portal, you're whisked into a surreal realm: the storm inside becomes a swirling vortex of memories, faces from your past laughing and beckoning, while the forest on the other side remains tranquil. You realize this dream bind yourself to the eye of the storm, and wake with a start, the taste of adventure lingering on your tongue. What happens next in your version?
