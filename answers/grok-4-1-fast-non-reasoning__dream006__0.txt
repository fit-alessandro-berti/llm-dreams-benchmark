You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak, your voice echoing confidently through the microphone. But midway through your opening line—"Today, we stand at the precipice of..."—your words slur into gibberish, like a radio tuning between stations. The audience leans in, murmuring, their faces morphing from expectant to puzzled, then amused.

Suddenly, your suit shrinks, buttons popping like fireworks, revealing polka-dot pajamas underneath. You try to adjust the mic, but it stretches into a giant noodle, flopping wildly as you chase it across the stage. Laughter erupts—not mocking, but infectious, rippling through the crowd like waves.

The floor tilts, turning the stage into a funhouse slide. You surf down it on your shrinking podium, landing in a sea of applauding hands that lift you up, up, up into a sky filled with floating speech bubbles filled with compliments. "Brilliant!" "Inspiring!" they pop and whisper.

Then, the dream shifts—you're no longer speaking; you're flying, the audience cheering below as confetti rains from your mouth instead of words. Pure joy, weightless and free, until the alarm buzzes... and you wake up, grinning, ready for the real day.
