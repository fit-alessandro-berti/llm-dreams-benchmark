...feel a cold knot tighten in your stomach. Panic, sharp and immediate, floods you. You spin around, desperate, scanning the towering, impossibly narrow buildings that lean in like conspirators. The architecture is a dizzying blend of Art Deco extravagance and brutalist concrete, windows reflecting a sky the colour of bruised plums.

You pull out your phone, but the screen is a kaleidoscope of shattered pixels, flickering with an ancient, indecipherable map. Every street name you try to read twists into hieroglyphs. You try to hail a cab, but the yellow vehicles that pass are horse-drawn carriages, then gondolas, then strange, silent monorails that glide on invisible tracks, their passengers faceless and still.

You start to run, heart hammering against your ribs, down a street that seems to stretch infinitely. The buildings become taller, the alleys narrower, until you're navigating a labyrinth where every turn looks identical. You call out, "Excuse me! Do you know where the... where the meeting is?" But your voice comes out as a whisper, then a quack, then nothing at all. The few people you encounter wear elaborate, historical costumes – a Victorian lady gliding past on roller skates, a knight in full armour struggling with an umbrella, a mime handing out invisible flowers. They simply smile, their eyes vacant.

You check your watch, but the hands spin wildly, then freeze on 11:58, then jump to 3:00 AM. The street beneath your feet begins to ripple like water, reflecting an impossible upside-down version of the city. You stumble into a grand, deserted plaza where the air hums with an unheard melody. In the center stands a colossal, silent clock tower, its face blank. As the dream shifts, the urgency of the meeting fades, replaced by a growing sense of surreal wonder and a profound, dream-like acceptance that perhaps, in this city, some things are simply not meant to be found. The ground feels less like concrete now, more like a shifting current, and you begin to float, gently, upwards, the vast city receding beneath you like a forgotten promise.
