…plant your boots against the trembling planks, feel the helm buck, and make your voice a clean blade through the wind.

“Reef the main! Storm jib only! Hands to leeward—move!”

Bodies spring. Lines hiss; a block snaps and spins; canvas shrinks to a hard, wet fist. The boom lowers. The ship shudders like a horse brought to a halt, then gathers itself. You put two turns of line round the wheel and lean your weight into it until the spokes bite your palms.

“We’ll heave to,” you say, more to the ship than to the sea.

The bow falls off, then settles at an angle to the wind; the storm howls past instead of through you. Spray needles your cheeks. The compass card wobbles, considers, then spins once like a blinking eye before steadying. Lightning sketches the bones of the clouds. For a breath—one, two, three, four—the deck is a bright white room. Then darkness again, warm and black as spilled ink.

“Skipper,” someone says behind you, shaky. “Orders?”

You turn and see your crew plainly in a flash: the one who jokes too loud, the one who counts, the one who doubts, the one who always volunteers. Under wet brims and tangled hair, they are all versions of a face you’ve known your whole life. Yours. Different ages, different scars, same eyes. They wait for a language they trust.

“Breathe,” you tell them first. “In on four, out on eight. Match the ship.”

They do, and the rigging hums in time. The mast stops knocking its teeth together. The hull finds a rhythm that feels like the slow, deliberate heartbeat of a whale somewhere under your keel. Fear doesn’t leave; it changes shape, goes from a shout to a steady hand that keeps you honest.

“Lash the helm. Back the headsail a touch. Keep her nose half a point higher. We’re not outrunning this one; we’re teaching it how to pass us by.”

They move with new economy. The storm still throws its weight around, but you’re not a wall anymore. You’re a hinge.

A bell rings—once, twice—though you have no bell. The sound is round and old and rememberable. It comes from the ribs of the ship, from the place the wood still remembers being tree. A memory flickers: a kitchen lamp swaying, a voice telling you to count between thunder and lightning. You count now: one, two, three… The gap lengthens. Or maybe you lengthen and the storm stays the same size.

The chart on the table below decks is blank where it should be marked. In its place, someone has drawn a line with a charcoal thumb, a single steady stroke aimed toward a word written where the paper frays: HOME. When you blink, the word becomes HARBOR, then HEART, then something you can’t read at all but understand anyway. You don’t take the line as a route. You take it as a promise.

You climb back up and the crew looks to you again. “What now, Captain?” asks your Doubter, polite as a student.

“Now we trust what holds,” you say. “Spar to spar. Knot to knot. Breath to breath.”

For a while—minutes, hours, a whole season—you trade with the weather. It brings a wave; you give a shoulder. It brings a gust; you let the backed jib bite and keep the bow high. It screams; you lower your voice. When you speak, the ship answers in small, satisfying adjustments: a creak, a heel, a refusal to skid. In the next lightning flash, you catch a glimpse dead ahead—not a lighthouse, not a star, but a thin seam of paler dark where the clouds are unstitched. A way through that isn’t quite a door and isn’t quite a wound.

“Port a quarter,” you say softly. “Good. Hold there.”

The Worrier grins without meaning to. The Jester forgets his joke and just works. The Counter, wet hair plastered to his forehead, counts your breaths instead of the seconds and nods. The Doubter watches your hands and learns how calm is a practice.

The sea throws one last hard question at the bow. You answer with your weight and the wheel and a patience you didn’t have yesterday. The crest smashes green and heavy across the deck, but the ship rises, shakes herself, and keeps her angle. Then the roar thins. The rain, still fierce, falls in straight lines instead of sideways knives. The wind backs a little, goes from command to conversation.

Shapes appear in the rain: the curve of a horizon you’d forgotten was out there, a bird that is either new or very old, the possibility of dawn. The crew exhales together. Someone laughs once like a bark, surprised at the sound of it.

“Secure the lines,” you tell them gently. “Hot tea if we’ve got it. We’ll wait for the light, then set a course the chart doesn’t know.”

No one asks which direction that is. In this dream, direction is a feeling you can hold in your hands as easily as a wet rope.

The ship leans into a quieter sea. The bell doesn’t ring again, but you feel its echo in the boards and in your bones. You touch the wheel, not to steer but to thank it. The crew moves about the deck in the purposeful quiet that follows storms and difficult truths. When the first thin blade of morning slips under the clouds, it paints every bead of water on every line, and for a second the rigging looks strung with stars.

You know you are dreaming because salt tastes like a word you can’t quite pronounce, and because your crew’s faces keep becoming people you love and then becoming your own again. But the orders are good orders, and the calm is a real calm. You will wake with it in your chest.

The storm still mutters behind you, far off, learning to say your name correctly. You set your shoulders, feel the ship answer like a friend, and give the only command that makes sense when the world has tried to take your voice and failed:

“Steady as she goes.”
