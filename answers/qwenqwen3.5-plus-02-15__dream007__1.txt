You decide to **stop talking and simply listen**, really listen, for the first time in the argument.

As you take a deep breath to hold back your next rebuttal, the room around you begins to warp. The harsh fluorescent lights soften into the warm, golden glow of a sunset you both watched years ago on a beach trip. The sound of raised voices dissolves into the rhythmic crashing of waves.

Your friend's angry expression melts away, replaced by a look of confusion as they notice the sand appearing beneath their feet instead of the office carpet. You look down and see that the important document you were fighting over has turned into a paper airplane, which slowly unfolds itself and takes flight, soaring toward the horizon.

"You're not mad anymore," your friend says, their voice echoing slightly as if coming from a distance. "Why aren't you mad?"

"Because I remember why we care," you reply, and as you speak, the memory of the actual issue fades, leaving only the feeling of your long friendship intact. The dream shifts again; suddenly, you are both children again, running toward the water, the argument forgotten, replaced by the urgent, joyful need to catch the tide before it turns.

Just as your toes touch the cool water, the alarm clock begins to buzz, pulling you back to reality, leaving you with a lingering sense of peace and a strange certainty that the disagreement doesn't matter as much as the connection does.
