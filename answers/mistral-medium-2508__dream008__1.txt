feel a strange mix of panic and exhilaration. The project is a glowing, shifting hologram hovering above your desk—a labyrinthine blueprint of a city that doesn’t exist yet, with streets that rearrange themselves like living veins. Your boss’s voice echoes unnaturally, as if speaking through water: *"We need this by tomorrow. The clients are already inside it."*

You reach out to touch the hologram, and your fingers pass through—only to emerge gripping a **quill made of glass**, its ink swirling with colors that don’t have names. The office around you begins to dissolve: the fluorescent lights flicker into stars, your coworkers’ faces stretch into masks of animals (a fox, an owl, a stag), and your desk transforms into a **floating raft on a river of liquid mercury**. The deadline isn’t just impossible—it’s *alive*. It slithers toward you like a shadow with teeth, whispering: *"You’ve always been late. Always."*

Then you notice the **clock on the wall**. Its hands spin backward, then sideways, then *out*—unraveling into threads of gold that weave themselves into a ladder climbing into the sky. Your boss is now a **giant crow perched on the highest rung**, cawing: *"The city won’t build itself, will it?"*

You realize: the project isn’t about finishing. It’s about **choosing which rules to break first**.

Do you:
1. **Dip the glass quill into the mercury river** and start drawing the city’s borders in midair, letting the ink bleed into reality?
2. **Climb the golden ladder**, even though each rung hums with a different memory (your first job interview, a childhood hideout, a door you never opened)?
3. **Turn to the shadow-deadline and ask it its name**, risking it laughing you into silence—or worse, answering?
4. **Wake up** (but the office is still there when you open your eyes, only now your hands are made of blueprints).
