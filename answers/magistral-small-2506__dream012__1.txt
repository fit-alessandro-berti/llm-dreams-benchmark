**Dream Continued...**

You grip the wheel tightly, the salt spray stinging your face as the ship groans under the strain of the waves. The crew watches you, their eyes reflecting fear and dependence. You take a deep breath, the storm howling around you like a living thing.

"Batten the hatches!" you command, your voice cutting through the chaos. The crew springs into action, securing loose ropes and reinforcing the masts. But the sea is relentless—waves crash over the deck, and the wind shrieks like a banshee.

Then, through the driving rain, you see it—a flicker of light in the distance. A single, steady beam cutting through the storm. A lighthouse. Hope surges in your chest.

"Steer us toward that light!" you shout. The crew turns as one, their spirits lifted by the sight. The ship lurches, but you hold firm, guiding them with unwavering resolve.

As the beam grows brighter, the storm ebbs slightly. The waves still rage, but the path forward is clearer now. You stand tall, your crew rallying behind you, knowing that even in the darkest tempests, a beacon can lead the way—if only you dare to follow it.
