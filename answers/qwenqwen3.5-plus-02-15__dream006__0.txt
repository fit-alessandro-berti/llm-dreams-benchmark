As I step onto the stage, I see the crowd looking expectantly at me, and I begin to reach for the microphone, only to find my hand passing right through it as if it were made of smoke.

A ripple of confusion moves through the audience, but instead of gasps, they start humming a low, vibrating note that seems to come from the floorboards themselves. The lights above don't shine down; instead, they pull upward, drawing the color out of my suit until I'm wearing a garment woven entirely from twilight shadows.

I open my mouth to speak, to apologize or to start my prepared remarks, but no words come out. Instead, a flock of paper cranes bursts from my lips, fluttering wildly into the spotlight. As they fly toward the audience, they grow larger, transforming into white doves that carry tiny, glowing lanterns in their beaks.

The crowd doesn't seem frightened. They reach up, and as the doves land on their shoulders, the lanterns ignite, filling the vast hall with a warm, golden light that smells faintly of rain and old books. Suddenly, I realize I'm not standing on a stage anymore, but on the surface of a calm ocean under a starry sky. The "audience" is now a circle of people I've known throughout my life—teachers, friends, strangers from a train ride years ago—all smiling silently.

I finally understand that the speech isn't something I need to say. The moment I realize this, the ocean beneath me lifts gently, raising us all into the air, and we begin to float upward together, drifting into the constellations where the stars rearrange themselves to spell out a single, comforting word: *Enough.*

Then, the dream softens at the edges, and I wake up with the lingering sensation of flight and the scent of rain still in the air.
