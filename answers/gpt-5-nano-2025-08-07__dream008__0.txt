You are dreaming. The room loosens its gravity as if the air itself were a liquid you can swim through. Your boss remains at the door, but the door doesn’t lead anywhere finite anymore; it yawns into a hallway that rolls like a wave.

The project sits on your desk as a glossy, impossible object: a stack of pages that keeps re-stacking itself the moment you look away. The deadline tag on the top page says, in bold red letters, YESTERDAY. Your boss smiles with that practiced, patient calm that makes time feel lighter and heavier at once.

“We need this by dawn,” your boss says, as if dawn is a switch you can flip with a finger.

You take a breath. The breath doesn’t go in and out so much as it expands and contracts the dream around you. The clock on the wall ticks backward for a moment, then forward again, looping like a carousel you once rode as a child. The fluorescent lights buzz a little tune, and the hum feels almost like encouragement.

You step toward the desk, but the desk isn’t a desk so much as a shoreline. The surface is glass, and below it, papers drift like fish in a clear river. You notice two things at once: each task on the page is written in a language you almost recognize, and each line rearranges itself into a more efficient order whenever you blink.

You lean in to study the page. A phrase jumps out: Start with the smallest win. It’s obvious and not obvious at the same time, which feels right for a dream. You tap the page, and it turns into a portable whiteboard, the kind that folds into a small cube you could carry in your pocket. You pocket the cube, and the world tilts a notch.

The boss steps closer, but the corridor tilts with him, the walls bending to reveal other rooms where time behaves differently. In one, a calendar waltzes across the floor—days slipping and sliding as if the date were a marble you could scoop up and place anywhere. In another, the team hovers in midair, your coworkers floating with balloons tied to ideas, each balloon labeled with a milestone.

A co-worker who looks like a younger version of you waves from the balloon line. “If you don’t know the next step, try the easiest next step,” they shout, and their words glow in the air like soft handwriting. They hand you a bright, shyly smiling lantern. The lantern doesn’t light, exactly; it reveals possibilities—paths that branch and branch again, like a tree growing out of the office chair.

You decide to begin not with a plan but with a question: What would this look like if the deadline didn’t exist? The dream answers with a chorus of small doors appearing along the wall, each door opening into a tiny, perfectly formed scene of progress. One door shows a simple prototype assembled in a corner, another shows a feedback loop turning noisy chaos into clean data, a third door releases you from perfect accuracy toward “good enough, with time to improve later.”

The impossible deadline feels thinner now, like a bubble you can press until it changes shape. You press and it becomes a knot of time—tangled, but gradually loosening. You reach through this knot with your hand and pull out a single thread labeled with a single word: Focus. The thread glows, not burning you but guiding you to pull on it in the right places.

The boss speaks again, but now their voice travels through the dream as a helpful echo: “If you can’t fix it all at once, fix one thing that makes the rest easier.” A light breeze flows inward from an open window, and you watch as the breeze rearranges the pages into a clean, logical sequence: Plan, Build, Test, Deliver, with the Deliver step already wearing a small, contented smile.

You take the first step—literally. The dream reconfigures the desk so you can stand and walk along a corridor made of whiteboards. Each board contains a tiny, achievable subtask that, once completed, floods the next board with a warm glow. The tasks click into place as if they’ve been waiting for you, not to overwhelm you, but to be taken one by one like stepping stones across a stream.

A moment later, the door behind you is no longer the door to the boss’s office but a doorway to a stage with a single chair, a single lamp, and a canvas waiting for your plan to appear as paint. You sit, and the canvas accepts a rough, honest draft—the kind of draft you’d show a trusted colleague to get quick feedback. It’s imperfect, but it breathes; it suggests a phased approach that buys time and buys clarity.

The dream folds in on itself like a camera lens focusing. The impossible deadline becomes a series of doable micro-moments. The lamp’s light sharpens. The desk becomes a stable surface again, not a shoreline or a ceiling but a solid place where you can begin.

Just as you feel the dream settling into a rhythm you recognize, a soft, knowing smile touches your mouth—the kind of smile you only wear when you realise you’ve learned something not just about work but about your own fear of letting go of control. You say to your boss, not aloud to wakefulness but into the dream’s air: “We start with one thing. Then we test. Then we learn. And if the road still leads through the night, we’ll navigate it together.”

A hush passes through the room. The calendar stops spinning. The balloons drift to the floor and pop into little bursts of light that melt into the carpet. The corridor smooths into a quiet hallway with a single door at the end, the kind of door that invites you to step through and wake up—or to stay a moment longer and see what’s possible when fear loosens its grip.

You wake.

The alarm clock ticks, not backward or forward, just forward again, and you sit upright with a soft, surprised clarity. The dream lingers in your chest like a small, warm ember. The project on your desk today doesn’t look so impossible after all. You know now you can start with one small win, and the rest will follow if you give it a real shot—and if you remain open to the dream’s quiet, guiding voice.
