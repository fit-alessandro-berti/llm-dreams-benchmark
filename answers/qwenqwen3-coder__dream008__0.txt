...start to feel that familiar knot in your stomach as adrenaline floods through you. But then something strange happens - instead of panicking, you find yourself calmly opening your laptop and typing with unusual clarity and speed.

The impossible deadline somehow feels manageable. Your fingers dance across the keyboard, pulling together ideas that normally would take weeks in what feels like minutes. Colleagues gather around, amazed as brilliant solutions seem to flow effortlessly from your mind.
