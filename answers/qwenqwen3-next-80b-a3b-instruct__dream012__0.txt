You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you—though your bones ache with exhaustion and your hands tremble on the wheel—feel something ancient stirring beneath the waves. 

The rain doesn't just fall—it sings. A low, woven hum, like a lullaby forgotten by gods. The lightning doesn’t strike—it *inhabits*. Each flash reveals not mere clouds, but vast, translucent tentacles curling through the air, trailing phosphorescent threads that stitch the sky to the sea. 

The crew mutters prayers, but you hear something else: your mother’s voice, long dead, whispering from the rigging: *“It’s not the storm you must weather, child. It’s the silence after.”*

Your first mate, a woman with eyes like cracked porcelain, grips your arm. “Captain—the compass spins backwards. The stars… they’re not where they should be.”

You look down. The map in your hand is no longer paper. It’s your own skin—veins etched into ink, scars forming islands, the pulse of your wrist tracing the course of the current.

The ship groans. The hull shudders. You realize—you are not steering the vessel.

The vessel is steering *you*.

A voice—deep as the abyss, soft as breath—rises from the deep:  
*“You sought to command the sea… but you were always its dream.”*

And then you remember.

You were never the captain.

You were the storm.

And your crew? They’re the echoes of every sailor you’ve swallowed—each one a memory you refused to let go.

With a breath that pulls the wind into your lungs, you do not fight the waves.

You open your arms.

You let go.

The ship dissolves into mist.

And the sea… the sea sighs—then sings you back to sleep.

—

You wake in a quiet cabin. Sunlight spills across sheets that smell of salt and lavender. A porcelain locket rests on your pillow. Inside, a tiny drawing of a ship. Written on the back in looping script:

*“Thank you for dreaming us.”*

Outside, the waves lap gently against the shore.

You smile.

You have never felt more alive.
