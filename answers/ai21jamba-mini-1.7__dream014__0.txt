Suddenly, you find yourself inside a cozy café, its warm aroma of freshly brewed coffee enveloping you like a comforting hug. The strangers lead you to a table by the window, where the view reveals a vibrant street market brimming with colorful stalls and the laughter of children.

One of them sits across from you, their smile soft and genuine, and says, "We know this city like the backs of our hands. Let's help you rediscover your way." Their words soothe your restless heart, and you suddenly feel lighter, as if the weight of uncertainty has been lifted.

Together, you step outside, the cacophony of the city replaced by the rhythm of a shared walk, each step taking you closer to a sense of belonging you hadn’t realized you’d been searching for. The dream ends as you realize, maybe the journey itself is the destination.
