As you step onto the stage, the air feels electric, charged with unseen energy. The spotlight blazes overhead, a single, merciless beam that seems to pierce through the darkness, leaving your shadow stretching long and jagged at the edge of the audience. Your palms sweat, but your voice rises anyway—hoarse, trembling, yet somehow resonant. The crowd is silent, not in fear, but in a kind of anticipation that makes your chest tighten. You begin to speak, but the words blur at the edges, as though they’re being rewritten by some unseen hand.  

“…hope is not a noun, but a verb,” you manage, and the words twist in the air, morphing into something else: a melody, a flicker of light, a whisper from the crowd that isn’t there. The audience dissolves into a sea of faces you’ve never seen, yet you recognize them—all of them. Your own reflection in the mirror behind you is a stranger, with eyes that reflect a thousand different futures. The speech you’ve prepared—about unity, about healing—has been overwritten. Now you’re speaking to a shadow of yourself, a version of you who’s already made the speech, who’s already *been* there.  

The crowd begins to move. Not in a way that’s logical, but as if they’re part of a rhythm you’ve never learned. They sway, their collective breath syncing with the beat of your heart, which is now a drum, a pulse that echoes through the hollowed-out space of the stage. You realize you’re not speaking to them—you’re speaking to the void between them, to the silence that’s *never* been there. The words you utter become a fire, consuming the stage, the audience, the very air. You feel yourself slipping, your body untethered, your thoughts unraveling into a language that only the stars understand.  

When the speech ends, the crowd is gone. The spotlight fades, and you’re left alone in the dark, your voice echoing with a hollow, metallic tone. You try to remember what you said, but the words have turned to ash. Instead, you hear a whispered question in your mind: *“Who are you, and why are you here?”* The answer is a whisper, too, and it comes from the shadows—*you are the dream, and the dream is you*.  

You wake up gasping, the room lit by the faint glow of a single bulb. The words “hope is not a noun, but a verb” linger in your throat, half-remembered, half-imagined. You look at your hands, still trembling, and wonder if the speech was real—or if it was just the beginning of something else.
