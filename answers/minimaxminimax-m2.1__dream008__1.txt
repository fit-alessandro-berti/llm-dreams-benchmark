You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel that familiar tighten in your chest—the one that says this is too much, this can't be done, everyone will see you fail.

But then something strange happens.

You look down at the project folder in your hands, and it begins to glow faintly. The fluorescent lights above flicker and hum, but instead of feeling panicked, a strange calm washes over you. You open the folder, and instead of spreadsheets or blueprints, you find pages filled with your own handwriting—notes you've never taken, diagrams you've never drawn, solutions to problems you didn't know existed.

Your boss is still waiting, arms crossed, but their face has shifted. They're not looking at you with expectation anymore. They're looking at you with recognition, like they've been waiting for you to remember something.

"The deadline isn't real," they say, their voice echoing slightly in the now-empty office. "It never was. You just needed to believe you could finish it."

You look around and notice that the office has transformed. The walls have become translucent, revealing vast landscapes of light and possibility beyond them. Your coworkers are gone, replaced by versions of yourself—different ages, different outfits, all sitting at identical desks, all working on the same project.

And then you realize: the project isn't a project at all. It's a door. You've been trying to open it your whole life, and you've finally found the key.

You smile, pick up your pen, and begin to write.
