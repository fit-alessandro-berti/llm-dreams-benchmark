You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to blend in fast—before the locals mistake you for a wandering sorcerer and tie you to a stake.

The air hums with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, and the cobblestones under your bare feet (where are your shoes?) lead you into a bustling medieval market square. Vendors hawk loaves of crusty bread, bolts of wool dyed in impossible hues, and trinkets that glint like captured stars. A blacksmith's hammer rings out a rhythmic prophecy, while children chase a flock of geese that honk like deranged trumpets. No smartphones, no cars—just the raw pulse of human ingenuity, powered by sweat and spite.

You spot a weathered signpost: "Ye Olde Tavern – Ale & Secrets Served." Perfect. Ducking inside, you snag a stool at the bar, where a barkeep with a beard like a bramble bush eyes you suspiciously. "Stranger, eh? From whence do ye hail? And what's that queer tongue ye mutter—'Wi-Fi'? Sounds like a goblin's curse."

Your heart races. You need a story, a skill, something to trade for a cloak and a crust. Remembering half-forgotten history lessons, you lean in and whisper, "I'm a teller of tales from the distant isles. Ever hear of a beast called the 'Dragon of Silicon'?" The barkeep's eyes widen. You've hooked him. Soon, the whole tavern's rapt, mugs forgotten as you spin yarns of glowing boxes that summon knowledge from the ether and chariots that fly without wings.

By nightfall, you're the village bard, paid in silver and stew. But as the fire crackles and the crowd roars for more, a chill wind rattles the shutters. Outside, shadows twist unnaturally—figures in hooded cloaks, whispering of a "time-thief" who's unraveled the weave of days. You? They think you're the key to some ancient prophecy, a wanderer who can stitch eras back together.

You bolt into the moonlit woods, pulse thundering, branches clawing like jealous lovers. Deeper in, the trees part to reveal a stone circle, etched with runes that pulse like forgotten code. Touch one, and the world shimmers—flashes of steam engines, roaring twenties jazz, and neon-lit hoverbikes. It's a nexus, a dream-weaver's crossroads.

Do you step through? Rewrite your tale? Or wake up, safe in your bed, wondering if the ale was real?

(Your move—what happens next in the dream?)
