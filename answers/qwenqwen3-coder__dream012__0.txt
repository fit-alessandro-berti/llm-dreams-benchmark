...grip the wheel firmly, feeling the wood creak beneath your hands as towering waves crash over the deck. Salt spray stings your face, but your eyes remain fixed on the horizon where lightning illuminates a gap in the storm clouds.

"Steady as she goes!" you shout over the howling wind, your voice carrying the authority of experience. Behind you, your first mate calls out reports - the sails are holding, the hull is sound, but the navigation equipment has failed.

You close your eyes for a moment, remembering your grandfather's words: "The sea doesn't test the strong - it reveals them." When you open them again, you spot something through the chaos - a faint light in the distance, bobbing gently despite the turmoil.

"Hard to starboard!" you command, steering toward that beacon of hope. "There's shelter ahead - follow me!"

The crew's cheers are barely audible over the storm, but you feel their renewed confidence as the ship cuts through the waves. Sometimes the greatest leadership isn't about having all the answers - it's about trusting your instincts and guiding others toward the light when all seems darkest.

As the first drops of rain from clearer skies begin to fall, you allow yourself a small smile.
