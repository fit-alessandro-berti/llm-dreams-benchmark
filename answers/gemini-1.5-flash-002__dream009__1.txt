You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around.  The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth.  Roughspun fabric scrapes against your skin; you're wearing a simple linen tunic and trousers.  Around you, a bustling medieval marketplace unfolds – stalls overflowing with herbs, brightly colored fabrics, and freshly caught fish.  The sounds are overwhelming: the haggling of merchants, the bleating of sheep herded down a nearby cobblestone street, the clang of a blacksmith's hammer.  You have no memory of how you got here, only a gnawing sense of disorientation and a growing unease.

As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find food and shelter.**  Your stomach rumbles a protest, a sharp reminder of your utter helplessness.  You have no money, no identification, and no understanding of this world's customs or language.  The faces around you are a blur of suspicion and curiosity; some stare openly, others avert their eyes.  You try a few words from your old life, but they are met with blank stares.

You notice a kindly-looking old woman tending a small herb stall.  Her eyes, though wrinkled, are sharp and observant.  Hesitantly, you approach her, mimicking gestures of hunger and offering a small, pleading smile.  She seems to understand.  She offers you a piece of hardtack bread and gestures to a small, dimly lit alleyway behind her stall.  It's not much, but it's a start.  The alleyway is dark and smells of rats, but it offers a semblance of privacy, a small space to process this bewildering new reality.  Your survival, you realize, depends on learning to adapt, to communicate, and to navigate this unfamiliar world one small step at a time.  The question now becomes: how will you learn the language, earn money, and ultimately, find a way home? Or will this medieval world become your new home, forever?
