As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and they begin to shift, rearranging themselves into a shimmering keyhole. Instinctively, you press your thumb against it, and the box clicks open. Inside, nestled in velvet, is a small silver key. You pick it up, and as you do, the key dissolves into stardust that swirls around you, lifting you into the air. The dream fades, but the sensation of unlocking something within yourself lingers as you wake.
