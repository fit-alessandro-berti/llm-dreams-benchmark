…stop talking. Not to storm off, not to win by silence, but to peel the noise away. The room around us blurs into a soft gray, as if someone has breathed on the glass of reality, and our words hang in the air like ribbons—blue for mine, red for yours—twisting and knotting themselves into a tense braid.

I raise a hand and the ribbons pause. We can see the shape of the fight: your fear wrapped around my need like ivy around a pillar. A small, bewildered animal sits at the center of it, something like a rabbit and a clock combined, ticking with a heartbeat. It’s what we’re both trying to protect, though neither of us had the right name for it.

“Okay,” I say, but my voice is a warm light instead of sound. I step closer to the animal. “I decide to ask the right question.”

“What are we really afraid of losing?” I ask, and the room shifts into a place we both recognize: a hallway from childhood, our made-up clubhouse, the porch where we once promised never to leave each other behind. The argument shrinks, like paint drying into a hairline crack.

You cross your arms defensively, but the gesture drips, becomes water, becomes rain on that porch. Your red ribbon loosens. “I’m scared you’ll choose that new path and forget me,” you confess. The words don’t sting—they float, luminous.

“And I’m scared that if I don’t take it, I’ll forget myself,” I answer. My blue ribbon unwinds and slips around the little clock-rabbit, which nuzzles both of our palms at once. We both laugh because of course it can.

We decide to rethread the argument. We tug the blue and red strands apart gently, lay them side by side on the porch boards. The ribbons become lines on a map, and the map becomes two doorways: one leading to a road lined with tall, unknown trees; the other to a familiar ocean, endless but safe. They are not mutually exclusive anymore—they’re connected by a footpath we hadn’t noticed, crossing a meadow of ordinary days.

“What if,” you say, and the dream listens like a cat poised to pounce, “we plan the meadow together? Check-ins. Visits. A signal if either of us starts to disappear.”

“What if,” I echo, feeling the relief arrive on quiet feet, “we bless each other’s doorways. You bring me seashells, I bring you leaves.”

We shake on it, but our handshake becomes a small bridge arcing between our chests. The argument dissolves into confetti that knows how to become birds. They lift and scatter, and we watch them go, no longer trying to catch them.

The clock-rabbit climbs onto my shoulder and then yours, ticking in a soothing tempo—an agreed-upon future. The porch merges back into the room we started in, but it’s wider now, with a window facing both the forest and the sea. Outside, the weather is exactly what we need.

“Thank you,” you say, and the words are a key that fits a lock I didn’t know I had. It turns. Something settles.

We decide to make tea. The kettle sings in a language our hearts understand, and the steam curls into new ribbons, white and simple, tying a bow around the moment. When I wake, there will be an aftertaste of peppermint and salt, and the certainty that the path is real as long as we keep naming it together.
