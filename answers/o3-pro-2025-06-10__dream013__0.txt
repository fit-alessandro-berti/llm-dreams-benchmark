…notice the walls begin to pulse faintly with bioluminescent symbols that rearrange themselves every few seconds, as though the maze is solving you while you try to solve it.

The next chamber is spherical, its floor sloping up toward the ceiling so that you stand in the hollow of a giant marble eye. Dozens of floating tiles revolve around you, each etched with a fragment of a sentence: “THE / EXIT / IS / FOUND / WHEN / YOU / LEARN / TO / …” They swirl too quickly to read in order. You close your eyes, listen to the whirring tiles, and allow the words to click together in your mind. Without touching a thing you whisper, “…stand still.” Instantly the tiles freeze and lock into place, forming a bridge across the chasm.

You step onto the bridge and discover it is made of polished reflections—pieces of memories: the smell of rain on childhood sidewalks, the first book you ever finished alone, the glow of a midnight screen during sleepless study sessions. Each reflection solidifies underfoot the moment you recognize it, solid proof that recall itself can be structural.

Beyond the bridge a narrow corridor branches into five identical passages. At the intersection a clock with no hands hangs above a pedestal that holds an hourglass whose sand flows upward. Scratched into the pedestal are the words, “Choose the path that already chose you.” The air hums with possibility. You realize the only passage faintly lit is the one where your shadow falls longest—subtly betraying the direction of an unseen light source. Trusting the hint, you walk into that corridor, and the others seal behind you with a gentle sigh.

The next room is quiet, impossibly quiet. Sound seems to vanish before leaving your lips. In the center stands a cube made of translucent letters. On each face, the letters rearrange themselves into questions you have never dared ask aloud: “Who are you when nobody is watching?” “What debt does your happiness owe to someone else’s sorrow?” The cube glows warmer as you contemplate, cooler when you deflect. Only when you answer honestly—not with words, but with an unflinching emotion—does one face dissolve, revealing a doorway.

You crawl through the doorway and find yourself in a garden under a twilight sky. Ivy-laced archways form the final walls of the maze. Stars hang low, as if pinned by invisible threads. Fireflies dance in constellations matching the freckles on your forearms. A single chair waits beside a pond as still as obsidian. On the pond’s surface floats a sealed envelope bearing your name in handwriting you recognize as your own.

You sit, open the envelope, and pull out a single puzzle piece. One side shows a perfect rendering of this very moment—the garden, the chair, your astonished face. The other side is blank except for a tiny inscription: “Wake up.”

Understanding dawns: this piece does not belong to the maze; it belongs to you. You stand, hold the piece to your chest, and feel the dream thin around its edges like paper held to light. The garden, the corridors, the spinning tiles—all fold inward, flattening into the puzzle piece until you are surrounded by luminous white.

You blink. Morning sunlight slants through your bedroom curtains. Your heart is steady, your mind clear. On the nightstand lies a small, unfamiliar object: a blank puzzle piece, warm to the touch, faintly pulsing as though it remembers the maze—and invites you to remember, too.
