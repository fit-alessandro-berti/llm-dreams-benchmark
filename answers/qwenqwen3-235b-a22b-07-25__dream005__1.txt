You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and realize something strange: no one speaks your language. Conversations swirl around you in a melodic, rhythmic tongue that sounds almost familiar, like words half-remembered from childhood, but utterly incomprehensible.

You catch glimpses of faces—some smiling, others whispering with intense focus—yet every time you approach someone, they drift apart like smoke, reforming into new constellations of laughter and movement. The room itself seems to breathe: walls expanding and contracting gently, chandeliers dimming and brightening like slow heartbeats.

Then, a sudden stillness. A hand touches your shoulder. You turn, and there they are—your friend. But something is different. They don’t speak, only *look*. Their eyes reflect the room behind you, but reversed, like a mirror. When you glance back, the gathering is gone. Only a long corridor remains, lined with doors, each slightly ajar.

Your friend points—not to one door, but to all of them at once. From behind each crack of light, you hear a sound: your name, called in your mother’s voice; the rustle of pages from a book you’ve never read but somehow know by heart; a melody played on a piano with no keys.

You step forward. The doors begin to open on their own.
