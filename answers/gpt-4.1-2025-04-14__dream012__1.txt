steady your grip on the wooden helm, squinting through sheets of rain as the thunder rumbles all around. The deck tilts beneath your feet, slippery with seawater, but your voice rings out clear above the howling wind:

“Hold fast, everyone! Reef the mainsail, secure the cargo, and keep your lines tight! We ride this out together.”

Lightning forks across the sky, illuminating terrified faces and frantic hands at the rigging. Suddenly, a monstrous wave rises on the starboard side, casting a shadow as tall as a castle. For a moment, time seems to pause — then you shout, “Hard to port! Brace for impact!”

Your ship creaks and groans as it climbs the mountainous wave. The wheel strains in your hands, threatening to twist free, but you draw strength from the unwavering trust of your crew.

As the bow crests the summit, you catch a glimpse of calm water gleaming on the horizon, just beyond the fury of the storm. You realize the only way out is through, so you fix your eyes on that promise of safety, heart pounding, and command:

“Full speed ahead! Trust the ship, trust each other — we’ll make it!”

A roar rises from your crew as you all face the storm, together.

And as your ship plunges into the maelstrom, you feel an unshakable certainty — that, against all odds, you and your crew will see the dawn.
