feel the weight of the task pressing down on you. The clock seems to tick faster, and the pressure builds. You look at the project details and they appear to be more complex than anything you've ever worked on. The deadline is approaching like a freight train, and you know you need to get started immediately.

As you sit down at your desk, the office around you begins to blur and distort. Papers start flying off the table, and your computer screen flickers. You can't focus on anything—your thoughts are scattered, and you're overwhelmed by the looming deadline. 

Suddenly, a colleague walks by and casually mentions that they're finishing their own impossible project with ease, which only makes you feel more anxious. You turn back to the screen and try to focus, but the clock on the wall is spinning wildly, the numbers warping and twisting.

As you scramble to get organized, you realize that the project has no clear instructions—just a vague description and a list of tasks that don’t seem to make sense. The tasks are impossible to prioritize, and you’re left to guess what’s most important. Your boss is still standing in front of you, but now their face is changing—shifting into different expressions, like they’re watching you closely, waiting for you to crack.

In your panic, the environment continues to warp, and the office becomes a labyrinth of hallways and rooms, each one more confusing than the last. You’re chasing down your scattered thoughts, trying to get everything done, but the finish line keeps moving further away.

Just as you’re about to give up, you wake up.
