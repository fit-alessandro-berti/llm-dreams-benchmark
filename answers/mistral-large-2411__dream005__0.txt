... you notice that each group is engaged in peculiar activities. The first group you approach is sitting on the floor, playing a giant game of chess with pieces that are alive and moving on their own. A queen piece turns to you and winks before continuing her march across the board.

You move on, slightly bewildered, and encounter another group standing in a circle, speaking in a language that sounds like whispers mixed with static. They seem to be communicating with a large, floating jellyfish that pulses different colors in response. You try to mimic their sounds, but the jellyfish merely floats away.

In the next room, you find a group of people swing dancing with animated fruit. An orange cuts in, tapping you on the shoulder, and you find yourself spinning and twirling with the citrus, laughing at the absurdity.

Finally, you spot the person you know, standing alone by a large, ornate mirror. As you approach, you see that the mirror doesn't reflect the room but instead shows a peaceful, waving wheat field under a bright blue sky. Your friend turns to you, smiles, and says, "I've been waiting for you. Want to go in?" They step into the mirror, disappearing into the wheat field.

You look around at the strange gathering, then back at the mirror. With a sense of adventure, you step forward, ready to follow your friend into the unknown...

(What happens next is up to your imagination!)
