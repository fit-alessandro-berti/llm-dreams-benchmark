**Dream Continuation:**

You wake up in a sunlit meadow at the edge of a dense forest, the air thick with the scent of wildflowers and damp earth. The sky is a vast, unbroken expanse of soft blues and golds, and the silence is broken only by the rustle of leaves and the distant call of birds. Around you, the world feels *alive*—not just alive, but *alive in a way that feels familiar, yet utterly foreign.*

You realize you’re not in a modern setting, but in a time when the world was still young, untamed by machines. The air hums with the quiet magic of nature, and the ground beneath your bare feet is warm, almost alive with the pulse of the earth itself. You remember fragments of a dream—perhaps a whisper of a lost civilization, or a vision of a world where humans and the land were one.

As you step forward, you notice something strange: the trees are older than memory, their roots twisting like ancient fingers into the soil. A small, curious creature—something between a fox and a wolf—darts past you, its fur shimmering faintly with an iridescent sheen, as if it’s made of starlight. It pauses, tilts its head, and lets out a sound that sounds almost *human*—like a laugh, but with a note of wonder.

Then, you hear it: the sound of a bell. Not a mechanical one, but a simple, handmade bell, hanging from a branch high in the trees. It’s been ringing for hours, its toll echoing through the forest like a call to something deeper than you. You follow the sound, and soon, you’re standing before a small, circular clearing where a group of people—clad in simple, woven garments—are gathered around a fire. Their faces are kind, their eyes bright with curiosity.

One of them, a woman with dark hair tied back in a loose braid, turns to you and smiles. *"You’re new here,"* she says, her voice warm but carrying a hint of something older, like the wind through the trees. *"The bell has been ringing for days, and no one has come. What brings you to our world?"*

You hesitate. You don’t know how to explain. The dream lingers in your mind like a half-remembered song. Then, you realize—this isn’t just a dream. It’s a *choice.* The world is waiting, and you’re the one who can step into it.

The woman extends a hand. *"Come. We’ll show you where the bell leads."*

And as you take her hand, the ground beneath you shifts—not with a crack, but with a whisper. The forest parts like a curtain, revealing a path that leads deeper into the heart of the world, where the old ways still breathe, and the future is written in the roots of the trees.

**What do you do next?**
- Follow the woman into the forest, ready to uncover the mysteries of this forgotten time.
- Ask the people about the bell—what does it mean? Who rang it?
- Notice something else strange in the clearing (a missing object, a shadowy figure, a strange symbol carved into the bark).
- Or… something else entirely. What dreams do you carry?
