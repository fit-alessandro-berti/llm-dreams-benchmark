As the storm rolls in, the air grows thick with the scent of damp earth and ozone. The once-gentle rustling of leaves becomes a frantic whisper, and the trees around you begin to sway violently, their branches clawing at the darkening sky. A gust of wind howls through the forest, carrying with it the distant sound of thunder—deep, resonant, and almost like a voice calling your name.

You quicken your pace, searching for shelter, but the path ahead seems to shift and twist unnaturally. The trees, once familiar and welcoming, now loom like silent sentinels, their bark peeling away in strange, swirling patterns. A flash of lightning splits the sky, illuminating the forest in a ghostly blue-white light, and for a split second, you see something moving between the trunks—something tall, slender, and not quite human. Its form flickers like a shadow given life, and when the darkness returns, it’s gone.

Then, the rain begins—not as droplets, but as a sudden, heavy downpour, as if the sky itself has torn open. The water is unnaturally warm, almost like tears, and it soaks through your clothes in seconds. You stumble forward, your breath coming in ragged gasps, and suddenly, the ground beneath you gives way. You fall—not into mud or water, but into a void of swirling colors and shapes, as if the forest has dissolved into a dream within a dream.

When you land, you’re no longer in the forest. You’re standing in a vast, empty hall made of smooth, black stone, its walls lined with flickering candles that cast no light. At the far end of the hall, a door stands slightly ajar, a faint golden glow spilling from the crack. As you take a step toward it, the door creaks open wider, revealing a figure standing in the doorway—a version of *yourself*, but older, wearier, with eyes that hold a depth of sorrow and wisdom you’ve never known.

The figure smiles sadly and says, *"You’ve been here before. You just don’t remember."*

Behind you, the storm still rages, but the hall remains eerily silent. The door beckons. Do you step through? Or do you turn back, knowing the forest—and the storm—will still be waiting when you wake?
