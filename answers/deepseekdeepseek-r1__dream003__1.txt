**Dream Completion:**

As you examine the box closely, you notice intricate patterns and **glyphs etched into its surface, shimmering faintly as if alive. The carvings twist like vines, weaving symbols you half-recognize—a crescent moon, an eye, a labyrinth. Suddenly, the metal grows warm beneath your fingertips, and the patterns begin to *shift*, rearranging themselves into a constellation of glowing stars. A hum resonates from within the box, low and ancient, as a single phrase surfaces in your mind: *"What you seek is already within."*  

Compelled, you press your palm to the center. The lid springs open with a sigh, releasing a swirl of iridescent mist. Inside lies **a mirror**, its surface rippling like water. But your reflection isn’t yours—it’s a stranger’s face, yet hauntingly familiar. Their eyes hold galaxies, and as you lean closer, they whisper, *"Remember."*  

The room dissolves. You wake with a gasp, the word echoing in your bones, the dream-box’s secret lingering just beyond reach—a riddle waiting to be unraveled.
