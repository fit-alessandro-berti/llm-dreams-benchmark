…take a slow breath, even though your chest feels tight and your hands are trembling. The room around you wavers—too bright, too loud—like the dream itself is holding its breath.

Your friend’s voice softens for a moment, but the frustration is still there, simmering. You can feel how much the issue matters to both of you; the weight of it presses on your shoulders like a heavy coat soaked in rain.

You decide to **step back**, not to withdraw, but to stop the cycle of talking over each other. You raise your hands gently, signaling a pause.

“Just—wait,” you say, and your friend stares at you, surprised. The air seems to shift, becoming warmer, almost humming.

You decide to **speak from underneath the anger**, from that quiet, raw place where the real worry lives.

“I’m scared,” you admit. “Not of losing the argument. Of losing *you*.”

The words hang between you, glowing faintly like fireflies. Your friend’s expression melts, the anger slipping away like sand through fingers.

Suddenly the walls of the room dissolve, turning into a vast field of tall grass swaying in a golden wind. Your friend is still standing there, but the tension has drained from their posture. They step closer, face calm now.

“I don’t want to lose you either,” they say. “That’s why this matters.”

The dream brightens, as if acknowledging the truth.

You decide to **reach out**—not to win, not to retreat, but to understand. And as your hands meet, the wind carries away the last fragments of the argument, leaving only the steady warmth of being heard.
