take a break and go for a walk to cool off. As you walk, you notice the beautiful scenery around you and begin to appreciate the world beyond your disagreement. You remember why you value this friendship and realize that the argument is not worth damaging your relationship. You return to your friend and apologize for your behavior, expressing your love and respect for them. Your friend does the same, and you both agree to move forward, stronger than before. You feel grateful for this moment of clarity and the chance to repair your friendship.
