a blank canvas floating mid-air, pulsating with an inner glow that hasn't yet decided its hue. You reach out, your fingers tingling as they brush its surface, and suddenly, the canvas awakens. Swirls of electric blue and molten gold erupt from the center, twisting into fractal trees that whisper secrets in a language of light.

As you watch, mesmerized, the trees bear fruit—glowing orbs that hatch into tiny winged creatures, each one a mosaic of shifting emerald and crimson patterns. They swarm around you, their wings brushing your skin like velvet sparks, inviting you to dance. You leap into the rhythm, your body morphing into a ribbon of silver smoke, weaving through arches of liquid amethyst that arch overhead like impossible rainbows.

Deeper in, the landscape warps: hills of velvet purple undulate like breathing lungs, rivers of liquid starlight carve paths through fields of whispering glass flowers. A colossal eye blinks open in the sky, its pupil a vortex of every color imaginable, pulling you toward a horizon where reality frays into infinity.

You awaken with a gasp, the canvas's echo lingering on your fingertips, colors dancing faintly behind your eyelids. What happens next in the dream?
