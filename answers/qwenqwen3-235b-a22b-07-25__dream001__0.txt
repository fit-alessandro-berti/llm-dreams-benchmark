...panic, your breath hitching in the sterile air of the endless chrome and glass canyon. The sky is a flat, featureless white, like a blank ceiling, casting no shadows. The buildings stretch upwards, impossibly tall, their surfaces smooth and seamless, reflecting distorted, elongated versions of yourself that seem to move independently. The streets are eerily quiet, paved with smooth, warm stone that feels slightly sticky under your bare feet—you don’t remember taking your shoes off.

You fumble for your phone. The screen is dark. Dead. You press the power button frantically. Nothing. Then, with a jolt, it flickers to life—but the screen is covered in shifting, iridescent symbols that mean nothing. No map, no contacts, just swirling patterns. You try to ask for help, but the few figures you see in the distance—dressed in identical grey suits, faces blurred like smudged ink—dissolve into the mist near the base of a building the moment you look directly at them.

Desperation claws at your throat. You start down one street, then another, the architecture repeating in subtle, disorienting ways. Every turn feels like a loop. You notice a small, ornate door set into a wall that had no door before. It’s made of dark wood, carved with intricate knots, warm and out of place. Against all logic, you know—*know*—this is the way.

You push the door open. It leads not into a building, but into a narrow, cobbled alley drenched in the golden light of late afternoon. Laughter and the smell of baking bread spill from unseen kitchens. The air is warm, real. At the end of the alley, a weathered sign swings gently: *The Owl & Compass*.

Inside, the room is dim, cozy, paneled in rich wood. A fire crackles in a hearth. At a small table in the corner sits a man wearing a hat tilted low, sipping tea. His presence feels both ordinary and deeply significant. Without looking up, he says, quietly:

“You're late. But you're here. That's what matters.”

And suddenly, you remember the meeting. It isn’t about work, or deadlines. It’s with yourself. The city, the panic, the impossible doors—it was all a test of direction. Of listening.

You sit down across from him. The man lifts his head just enough to smile. You don’t see his face, but you recognize the feeling.

“Where have I been?” you ask.

“Lost,” he says. “But not gone.”

Outside, the city has vanished. Only the sound of rain on the roof remains, gentle, familiar. The dream isn’t ending—it’s just beginning to make sense.
