You wake in a dimly lit chamber, the air thick with the scent of damp stone and beeswax candles. Sunlight streams through a narrow arched window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The bed beneath you is a pile of rough-spun wool blankets, and your fingers brush against heavy, embroidered tapestries instead of familiar cotton sheets. Panic flares as you sit up—no phone, no clock, no electricity. The walls are bare stone, and a wooden chest sits in the corner, bound with iron straps. Outside, you hear the clip-clop of hooves and the distant toll of a bell, not the mechanical drone of traffic.  

You dress in a spare tunic and trousers left on a chair, realizing they’re made of coarse linen. Venturing outside, you’re stunned by cobblestone streets, timber-framed houses with thatched roofs, and people in long, hooded cloaks. A signpost carved into wood reads *“Florentina 2 milia passuum”*—Florence, 2 miles away. The architecture feels ancient, yet vibrant: merchants hawk spices from colorful stalls, children chase chickens, and a man in a leather apron hammers at a forge. You overhear Latin and a dialect you barely comprehend.  

As you explore the town square, a commotion erupts. A town crier announces a *“visitation from the Signoria”*—Florence’s ruling council—demanding taxes. A villager, an old woman clutching a clay pot, is dragged away for arrears. You realize you have no coin, no identification, and no understanding of the local customs. Hunger gnaws at your stomach, and the weight of your predicament sinks in: you’re stranded, likely in Renaissance Italy, with no way home.  

Your survival instincts kick in. You spot a public well and approach it, pretending to draw water while eavesdropping. A woman nearby laments the lack of work since the harvest failed. An idea sparks: you offer to help her carry her jars back to her cottage, using your modern knowledge of hygiene—boiling water, basic sanitation—to gain her trust. She introduces herself as Caterina, a widow with a small herb garden. Impressed by your “strange but sensible” ideas, she offers shelter for a few days in exchange for labor.  

But danger looms. The town’s Podesta (magistrate) eyes you with suspicion, noting your unfamiliar clothes and accent. That night, while mending a fence for Caterina, you overhear men plotting to accuse you of witchcraft—your “unnatural” knowledge could mark you as a heretic. You must flee. With Caterina’s help, you steal a mule and provisions, heading toward Florence. The journey is perilous: bandits lurk in the forests, and you navigate by the stars, your phone long dead and useless.  

In Florence, you’re awed by the Duomo’s dome and the scent of fresh paint in the air of the Piazza del Duomo. But the city is tense—Medici rivals clash in the streets. You find refuge as an apprentice in a workshop, learning the Florentine dialect and trading your literacy (a rare skill) for lodging. Yet, the Podesta’s men hunt you. In a climactic chase, you’re cornered in a leather-bound library. As the guards burst in, your fingers brush an ancient astrolabe on a dusty shelf. Its metal surface glows faintly, and when you turn it, the room dissolves into light.  

You jolt awake in your own bed, heart pounding. Sunlight streams through modern blinds, and the buzz of your phone’s alarm fills the air. Relief floods you—until you notice the strange symbol etched onto the astrolabe’s image, now glowing on your nightstand. The dream wasn’t over. It was just beginning.
