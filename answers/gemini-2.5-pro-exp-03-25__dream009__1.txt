Okay, here we go... diving back into the dream...

* * *

...The rough texture of wool scratches against my skin. That's the first sensation. The second is the smell – damp earth, woodsmoke, and something vaguely like unwashed livestock. My eyes flutter open, not to the familiar ceiling of my bedroom, but to heavy, dark wooden beams overhead, cobwebs thick in the corners. Sunlight streams weakly through a small, grime-covered windowpane set deep into a rough stone wall.

Panic flares, cold and sharp, but it's muffled, dreamlike. I sit up on the straw-filled mattress. Where...? This isn't my room. This isn't my *time*. The clothes I'm wearing aren't mine either – a simple, coarse linen tunic and trousers, tied at the waist with a rope belt.

Pushing myself off the low bed, my bare feet meet cold, uneven stone flags. I move towards the heavy wooden door, lift the iron latch – surprisingly heavy – and peer outside.

My breath catches. I'm standing on a narrow, muddy lane flanked by leaning timber-framed houses. People bustle past, dressed similarly to me, though some wear leather jerkins or long, drab dresses. They carry baskets, lead donkeys laden with goods, or shout greetings in a language that sounds vaguely Germanic but utterly incomprehensible. Horse-drawn carts rumble over the packed earth, their wooden wheels groaning. No cars, no phones, no plastic, no electricity pylons against the grey sky. The air hums not with technology, but with the thrum of simple, hard lives.

A wave of profound dislocation washes over me. How did I get here? *When* am I? Fear mixes with a strange, detached curiosity. I take a tentative step out into the lane, trying to look like I belong, though I feel ridiculously out of place. A blacksmith's hammer rings rhythmically nearby. The smell of baking bread mingles with less pleasant odours.

As I wander, observing the flow of this unfamiliar world – the way people avert their eyes from a man in finer, darker clothes, the specific gestures used in the marketplace, the symbols carved above certain doorways – a stark realization begins to dawn, cutting through the dream-fog. It’s not just about survival in a physical sense. It's about understanding.

...you realize you need to **figure out how to communicate, and quickly.** Not just the language, but the *meaning* behind the glances, the pauses, the way someone spits on the ground after another passes. Without understanding the social codes, the power structures, the basic dos and don'ts whispered on the very air of this place, I'm not just lost; I'm vulnerable. A wrong word, a misplaced gesture, even looking someone important in the eye for too long... it feels, instinctively, like it could have consequences far more permanent than mere embarrassment. I need to decipher this world before I blunder into its unseen dangers. I need a key, a guide, *something*, before this strange reality solidifies around me completely.
