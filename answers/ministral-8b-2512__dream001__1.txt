In your dream, the city unfolds around you like a living puzzle—its architecture shifting between the familiar and the surreal. The air hums with a low, rhythmic pulse, as if the buildings themselves are breathing. You glance down at your hands: your watch is gone, replaced by a faint, glowing symbol—a spiral of constellations that wasn’t there before. The streets, once straight, now bend in impossible curves, and the sky above is a deep, shifting violet, streaked with silver threads that seem to whisper when you focus on them.

You take a deep breath and step forward, the soles of your shoes pressing into cobblestones that feel warm beneath your feet. Ahead, a grand archway looms, its doors carved with faces that seem to watch you. A voice—soft, layered like distant echoes—whispers in a language you almost recognize: *"The path is not lost, but waiting."* You turn to see a figure standing where there was no one a moment ago. They’re dressed in robes that shimmer like liquid starlight, their eyes reflecting the city’s glow. They don’t speak, but their gaze lingers on the spiral symbol on your hand.

Before you can ask, the figure gestures toward the archway. As you step inside, the world dissolves into a tunnel of swirling light. When you emerge, you’re in a vast, circular chamber where time seems to move differently. The walls are lined with floating orbs of light, each pulsing with a unique rhythm. At the center stands a table draped in a cloth that shifts between black and silver, and upon it lies a single, intricately carved key—its metal etched with the same spiral as your hand.

A clock on the wall ticks backward, its hands spinning in reverse. The voice returns, clearer now: *"The meeting is not where you expected. It is where you are now."* The chamber trembles slightly, and the orbs of light begin to align in a pattern, forming a map—or a warning. You reach for the key, but as your fingers brush it, the door behind you slams shut. The figure from before is gone, replaced by a shadowy figure with hollow eyes. They smile, revealing teeth that are too many, too sharp. *"You’re early,"* they say. *"But the rules have changed."*

The key grows warm in your palm. The spiral on your hand pulses. And then—

**What do you do?**

*(Do you take the key? Try to open the door? Listen to the orbs? Or something else entirely?)*
