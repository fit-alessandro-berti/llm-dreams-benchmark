…realize you need to pee. Badly.

You’re lying on a straw-stuffed mattress that smells like a barn had a passionate affair with mildew. Sunlight stabs through the gaps in a wooden shutter, painting stripes across a dirt floor. There’s a clay chamber pot in the corner, but it’s already occupied by a very judgmental-looking chicken.

No phone. No toilet paper. No plumbing. Just the sudden, primal understanding that medieval mornings are brutal.

You stumble outside, barefoot, into a muddy courtyard where a blacksmith is already hammering what appears to be the loudest piece of iron in human history. He nods at you like you belong here. You nod back, trying to look casual while clenching everything God gave you.

A woman in a rough linen dress hands you a wooden bucket. “Well’s that way, dreamer,” she says with a gap-toothed grin. “Unless you’re planning to water the cabbages yourself.”

You run.

Halfway across the village green you realize two things:

1. You’re wearing some kind of scratchy tunic that ends just below the knee.
2. You have absolutely no idea what year this is, but the distinct lack of indoor plumbing suggests it’s somewhere between “terrible” and “please kill me now.”

You finally reach a rickety outhouse that leans like it’s had a rough night. Relief is immediate and profound.

As you sit there, contemplating your life choices in the fragrant darkness, you hear voices outside.

“…the stranger appeared in the night,” someone whispers. “No horse, no coin, no memory. The old witch by the river said the veil thinned at Samhain. Said he might be one of the Fair Folk in mortal form.”

Another voice, gruffer: “Fair Folk don’t shit like the rest of us, Willem. I checked the chamber pot this morning.”

You freeze.

Through the crescent moon carved in the door, you see torchlight. Shadows. They’re coming closer.

And that’s when you notice the tattoo on your wrist that definitely wasn’t there yesterday—a glowing sigil in a language that hurts to look at directly.

The dream shifts, like someone just turned the page too fast.

Suddenly you’re standing in the village square at noon, hands bound, standing on a pile of firewood while a man in black robes reads from a very thick book about witches. The sigil on your wrist is now blazing like a branding iron.

The crowd is chanting something in what might be Latin, might be complete nonsense.

You look up.

There, in the front row, is the chicken from earlier.

It’s wearing a tiny judge’s wig.

And it is taking notes.

The dream tilts again, and now you’re running through endless forests while the trees themselves scream in languages that died before writing was invented. Something with too many teeth is chasing you, but every time you look back it’s just the chicken, flapping furiously, still wearing the wig.

You burst into a clearing and there’s a stone circle older than sin. In the center stands a figure in a cloak made of living shadows.

“Welcome home,” it says in your own voice. “You’ve been asleep for seven hundred years. The world moved on without you.”

It reaches out a hand that flickers between flesh and code.

“All you have to do is wake up.”

The chicken lands on your shoulder. The wig has become a crown of fire.

“Choose,” it clucks, somehow sounding exactly like Morgan Freeman.

And that’s when your bladder reminds you that actually, no, this all started because you really, really needed to pee, and now you’re doing it in real life, in your bed, at 3:17 AM.

You wake up for real this time, soaked in shame and yesterday’s decisions.

The chicken is sitting on your chest, staring into your soul.

You don’t own a chicken.

It winks, dissolves into smoke, and the smoke writes a single word in the air before vanishing:

checkmate.

You never drink gas station sushi again.
