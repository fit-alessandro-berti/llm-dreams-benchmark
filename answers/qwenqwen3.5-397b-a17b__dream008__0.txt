You reach for the keyboard, but your hands feel miles away, heavy as lead. When your fingers finally touch the keys, they turn into dandelion seeds and scatter into the air. The deadline isn't a time on a clock; it's a physical wall of dark fog slowly closing in on you from the far end of the office.

Your boss leans forward, but their face is a blank mirror reflecting your own panicked eyes. They ask for the file, but the computer screen is now a deep, still ocean, rippling with a light that doesn't exist in the waking world. You realize you don't need to type; you need to dive.

So you do. You plunge into the monitor, weightless and silent. The pressure vanishes. The office dissolves into blue light. You are floating. There is no work here, only the rhythm of your own breath. The fog wall stops moving. The mirror-face smiles and fades into the blue. And then, the sensation of falling backwards, soft and slow, pulls you up through the layers of sleep until the ceiling of your bedroom comes into view, and the alarm clock hasn't even rung yet.
