You are dreaming.  

You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to pause, breathe, and let the words sink into the air like feathers before a storm.  

Instead of fighting, you decide to lift your hands and reach back through the cracks of the wall that separates you. What you find is a corridor of starlight where the debate feels like a simple tug of conversation, but the hallway stretches into an endless corridor lined with mirrors that do not reflect yourself, but instead show faint snippets of memories—each fleeting moment of your friendship flickering behind glossy glass.  

You step forward, and the mirrors begin to open like doors, each one whispering a question and answer in a language that is neither yours nor your friend's but something like the scent of cinnamon and rust—an auditory scent. This door, the third one from the left, leads into a library where books float on currents of scent instead of being bound by covers. You find no paper pages, but wind-currents forming words that rearrange themselves the moment you read them.  

Your friend is not on the other side of this corridor. Instead, a version of them is seated at a massive oak table, made of intertwining roots, holding the same open book that you are reading. The roots sing with the steady thrum of earth and pollen. There's a small, bright spark of light trapped in a clear glass jar resting on their palm; it hums. The spark sings the lament of what was fought—something like unfinished vows or a shared dream that slipped the floorboards of your future.  

You speak silently, and the sparking heart of the book blooms into light. “What if we simply listened?” you whisper into the space where the words echo like the peals of distant bells. The books in the library start to unfurl, threads twining themselves around your fingertips like vines on your cheeks, pulling gently but forcefully. The vine whispers a reason for the disagreement being the stepping stone to the next layer—an apology. The vines curl into a net that carries both of you up, slowly, buoyantly, over the corridor to the top of the oak.  

At the top, you see an open sky, a lake of reflected moons, where the sky is a dark watercolor with splashes of sunset. The lake's surface ripples like a crowd's sigh, and you notice gentle eyes: your friend's eyes looking at you through the watery foam, your own reflected back. The air smells like lavender and wet stone, and you realize you are standing before a doorway carved out of salt that glimmers with unkept promises.  

You decide to walk into the doorway without a fear—just a single step that breaks the dream's boundaries. As you step, the world below dissolves into ribbons of color, as if you pulled themselves from the memory of a lullaby. The laughter of the dream fills the air, a melody that knows how to mend what you hold precious. In that moment, you release the accusation. You learn you both owned the disagreement from different angles—your friend's line of sight was a sharp chisel, and yours, a gentle wave.  

You lift the hand of the friend and let your souls bind, the two fingerprints swirling into one—an imprint only possible in a dream, or perhaps in the quiet silence of the morning after. You speak, “I want to…” like making a wish to be the calm. The dream bows out, slowly turning into a patch of sunlight. A single line glides at the end:  

**“If we had decided instead to dream together rather than argue, the world would write our conversation as the bridge between what we feared and what we love.”**
