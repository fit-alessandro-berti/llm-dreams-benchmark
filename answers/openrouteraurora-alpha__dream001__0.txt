You start to run, but the streets seem to stretch and fold like a living map. Neon signs flicker in languages you almost recognize—half‑Arabic, half‑Morse, half‑the soft hum of a lullaby. The pavement beneath your feet is a mosaic of polished glass, and each step sends ripples of light across the surrounding buildings, as if the city itself is breathing.

A gentle, metallic scent of rain lingers in the air, though the sky above is a kaleidoscope of twilight blues and amber clouds that drift in slow, deliberate circles. You glance at your watch—its hands are spinning backward, counting down the hour in reverse. The meeting is somewhere in the heart of the city, but the heart is not a place; it’s a feeling, a pulse you can’t quite grasp.

You decide to follow the sound. A faint, rhythmic thrum grows louder with each turn—a blend of distant traffic, a distant choir, and the soft ticking of an ancient clock tower. The thrum guides you down an alley where the walls are lined with towering bookshelves, each shelf holding a single, glowing page that flutters like a moth’s wing. One page turns toward you, its text rearranging itself into a single word: **“Remember.”**

A sudden breeze lifts the pages, scattering them into the street. As they swirl, the city reshapes itself. The skyscrapers melt into towering trees whose trunks are made of copper wire, their leaves shimmering with tiny screens that flash snippets of your own memories—childhood afternoons in a sun‑drenched garden, the taste of fresh coffee on a rainy morning, the sound of a distant train whistle.

You pause, feeling a tug at the back of your mind. The meeting, you realize, isn’t a room or a conference table; it’s a convergence of all the paths you’ve taken, the choices you’ve made, and the possibilities you’ve yet to explore. The hour ticks down, but the city seems to stretch infinitely, offering you countless doors, each painted a different hue.

A soft voice, barely louder than a whisper, calls your name from a doorway shaped like a giant, open palm. You step through, and the world blurs. You find yourself in a vast, circular atrium bathed in golden light. In the center stands a single, polished stone table, and seated at it is a figure whose face is a mosaic of all the people you’ve ever known—friends, strangers, mentors, and even versions of yourself from alternate timelines.

The figure lifts a cup of steaming tea, the aroma of jasmine and pine filling the space. “You’ve arrived,” it says, and its voice is both yours and not yours. “The meeting was never about a location. It was about the journey that brought you here—the curiosity, the wonder, the willingness to keep moving even when the map disappears.”

You sit down, feeling the warmth of the tea seep into your hands. The clock on the wall stops ticking, and the city outside the atrium freezes in a perfect tableau of light and shadow. In that moment, the urgency of the hour melts away, replaced by a quiet certainty: the meeting you were looking for was the very act of searching, the dream itself, and the realization that every street, every whisper, every flickering sign was a reminder that you are always exactly where you need to be.
