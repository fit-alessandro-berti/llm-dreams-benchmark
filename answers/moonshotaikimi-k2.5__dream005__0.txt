 the walls keep breathing. you notice this about halfway through the kitchen—how the wallpaper exhales when you aren't looking directly at it, floral patterns expanding like lungs. you clutch your drink (when did you get a drink? it is blue, impossibly blue) and edge past a cluster of people wearing masks that look exactly like their own faces, only more symmetrical.

"have you seen—" you start, but the question dissolves on your tongue because you cannot quite remember the name. it starts with a letter. maybe *m*? or is it a sound, like the wind against glass?

the crowd shifts.

you move into the next room, which is simultaneously a library and a swimming pool. people stand waist-deep in water that smells like old paper, holding cocktails and discussing philosophy with the intensity of those who know the world is ending at midnight. a woman with silver hair that moves like seaweed reaches for your arm. "you're looking for the one who brought you," she says, and it's not a question. "they're upstairs. always upstairs."

but the stairs are spiral, carved from something that looks like ivory but feels like warm candle wax under your palm. you climb and climb and the party below becomes a murmur of tides, and each step you take creates a note—*b flat*, *d sharp*—building a chord that hangs in the air like smoke.

the second floor is a greenhouse at dusk, though when you look out the windows you see not stars but the bottoms of shoes from the party above, walking on glass that is somehow beneath your feet. here, a circle of people sit cross-legged in the soil, growing. literally growing—one man has daffodils sprouting from his collar, and a girl is laughing with sunflowers unfurling from her mouth. they invite you to sit, to wait, to become, but you cannot because the blue in your glass is evaporating, rising like a signal.

then you see them.

across the atrium, through three walls of glass that shouldn't be transparent from this angle, standing on a balcony that overlooks an ocean that the house definitely doesn't have. they're wearing the yellow coat you remember (or is it green? it changes when you blink, settling into a color that doesn't exist in the waking world—*grue*, your mind supplies, a portmanteau of grief and blue).

you call out but your voice is a moth, soft and papery, buffeted by the humidity.

you push through the greenhouse, past the people who are now melting into the furniture, becoming the chairs and tables themselves—flesh wood, bone china—and you run up stairs that are books, entire encyclopedias stacked and sagging under your weight, knowledge compressing beneath your heels.

the balcony door is locked. of course it is.

but through the glass, they turn. they see you. and they smile with too many teeth, or perhaps the right number, but arranged in a pattern that suggests constellations, maps to places you haven't been yet. they press their palm against the barrier, and on your side of the glass, frost forms in the exact shape of their handprint.

you place your hand over it.

the glass doesn't shatter—it simply forgets it was ever there, drifting away like fog—and you step through into silence. the party noise cuts off like a switch. the ocean below is actually the carpet, deep and undulating. the sky above is the ceiling, painted with lightbulbs that think they're stars.

"you took forever," they say, and their voice is your own voice, or perhaps your mother's, or perhaps the sound of rain on a tin roof from that summer you can't quite place in linear time.

"i got lost," you admit.

"everyone does," they say, and take your hand. their skin is warm wax, shifting, becoming the color of safety. "but the important thing is that you kept looking. in dreams, the searching is the finding. the looking is the being found."

the yellow-green-grue coat opens like wings, or doors, or the covers of a book you've been trying to finish for years, and you step inside, not into fabric but into a room that smells like childhood mornings and possibility.

the party continues without you, below and above and sideways, rooms multiplying like cells, the house growing larger and larger until it contains every gathering that has ever happened or will happen, all the strangers becoming familiar, all the familiar becoming strange, and you—

you are finally not alone, or perhaps you finally understand that you never were, and the dream exhales, and you exhale with it, and somewhere, a blue glass sits empty on a table, waiting for morning.
