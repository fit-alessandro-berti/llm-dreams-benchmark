…as you approach, the canvas begins to breathe. The air smells like rain on hot stone, and every step you take changes its surface—first ripples, then soft waves, then a mist that gathers into faint outlines.

You lift your hand, and paint appears on your fingertips without you knowing how. When you touch the canvas, it doesn’t accept the color so much as it remembers it. You draw a circle, and it becomes a doorway. You draw a line, and it turns into a river that spills onto the floor, flowing upward into the sky. The landscape around you bends to match each mark.

Shapes drift past like curious animals—triangles with wings, spirals that hum, squares that glow when you look at them directly. They seem to want to be part of the canvas, so you invite them in with a gesture, and they melt into paint and become part of a moving scene.

Soon the canvas is no longer flat. It grows outward, wrapping around you, becoming the world itself. Every color you place becomes a feeling: blue is a memory of a laugh, gold is a warm childhood afternoon, deep red is the pulse of something important you can’t quite name. You realize you’re painting not what you see, but what you are.

Just as the last color settles, a soft voice speaks from the edges of the dream, asking, “What do you want to keep when you wake?”

You pause. The dream steadies. And in that moment, you choose a single color—your own—and the world folds gently into it as the canvas fades to white.
