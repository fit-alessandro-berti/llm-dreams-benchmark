take a deep breath, trying to steady your emotions. The world around you feels strangely fluid, as if the walls are swaying slightly. Your friend's voice wavers, their expression flickering between frustration and concern.

"I don’t want to lose you over this," they say. Their words echo, stretching and folding in on themselves.

You reach out, instinctively grasping their hand. "Neither do I," you respond, but as you speak, your voice morphs—shifting in tone, as though it belongs to someone else.

Suddenly, the setting changes. The familiar room fades, replaced by a vast, moonlit field. Fireflies drift lazily around you, pulsing with golden light. Your friend is still there, but they seem distant, their features obscured by a soft glow.

“We have to find the key,” they whisper, as if the meaning should be obvious.

A low hum vibrates through the air, and you realize something is hidden beneath your feet. The earth is warm—alive. You kneel down, brushing away the grass, and see something gleaming just beneath the soil.

You look up at your friend, your heartbeat quickening. "What happens if we find it?"

They smile—cryptic yet familiar. "Then we wake up."
