You’re standing in the centre of a vast, chandelier‑lit ballroom. The ceiling arches high above you, the marble floor reflecting a thousand tiny lights that flutter like fireflies. The air smells of perfume, champagne, and faint incense, and a low hum of conversation fills the space, punctuated now and then by the distant tinkle of a grand piano.

You only know one person here—a friend you’ve been trying to locate for what feels like an eternity. The thought of them is a warm compass in the back of your mind, pulling you forward through the sea of faces.

As you push through the crowd, you encounter first a cluster of women in shimmering evening gowns, their heads bent together, whispering secrets that seem to dissolve the moment you get close. Their laughter is melodic but fleeting, and you feel a brief, surreal shift in the lighting—a flash of amber that makes their silhouettes ripple like water.

Near the far wall, a group of men in crisp suits are gathered around a small, ornate table. They’re playing a quiet game of cards, the cards themselves glowing faintly, as if lit from within. One of them glances up, his eyes meeting yours for a heartbeat before he smiles and gestures you over. You politely shake your head and keep moving, the cards’ glow fading behind you.

A little further in, a circle of teenagers bursts into an impromptu dance, their movements sincronised to an unseen beat. The music seems to come from the very walls, a synth‑driven rhythm that pulses through your chest. Their energy is contagious, and for a moment you feel the crowd’s momentum lift you, as if you could float above the floor. But you hold onto the image of your friend, and the feeling passes.

You turn a corner and step into a quieter wing of the venue. Here, a group of elderly men and women sit on plush velvet chairs, sharing stories in low voices. Their faces are lined with time, and they speak in a language you don’t understand, yet the tone feels warm, almost like a lullaby. One of them looks up, his eyes twinkling, and nods toward a narrow hallway that seems to lead deeper into the building.

Following the hallway, you pass a series of doors that swing open on their own, each revealing a different scene: a garden bathed in moonlight, a library filled with towering books that seem to breathe, a kitchen where chefs glide between silver pots, and a small theater where a lone actress rehearses a monologue, her voice echoing like a dream.

Finally, at the end of the corridor, you push through a pair of heavy oak doors and find yourself on a expansive rooftop terrace. The night sky stretches out, a blanket of stars interrupted only by the occasional fireworks that burst silently in the distance. And there, perched on the railing with a glass of wine in hand, is your friend.

They turn, smile, and wave you over. The crowd below seems far away, as if the rooftop exists in its own quiet world. As you walk toward them, the breeze lifts your hair, and the faint sound of the ballroom fades into a soft hum. Your friend says, “I’ve been waiting for you,” and the dream shifts, the tension you’d been carrying melts away, replaced by a sense of belonging and calm.

You take a seat beside them, look out at the glittering city beyond, and for a moment the entire gathering feels like a backdrop to a conversation that’s been waiting all night to happen. The dream continues, but now you’re no longer searching—you’re exactly where you wanted to be.
