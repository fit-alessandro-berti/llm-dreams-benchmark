...and each group seems to shift and blur like watercolors on wet paper. The first cluster stands near a towering ice sculpture that’s slowly melting into a puddle of champagne—people laugh too loudly, their voices overlapping in a language that sounds familiar but whose words slip away the moment you try to grasp them. You catch a glimpse of your friend’s red scarf in the next room, but when you push through the crowd, it’s gone, replaced by a woman with the same scarf wrapped around a birdcage holding a clock instead of a bird.

You move on, drawn by the scent of burnt sugar and old books. A second group gathers around a piano that plays itself, keys dancing without hands. They’re debating whether time is a spiral or a Möbius strip, and when they notice you, they fall silent, their eyes soft and expectant, as if you hold the answer. You stammer something inconsequential, and they nod solemnly, as though you’ve just revealed a profound truth.

Further down a hallway lined with mirrors that reflect versions of you from different ages—child, elder, alternate selves—you spot your friend again, near a balcony overlooking a city that shouldn’t exist: buildings made of stacked violins, streets paved with typewriter keys. But when you call out, your voice comes out as smoke, curling and vanishing before it reaches them.

You realize then that the gathering isn’t just a party—it’s a labyrinth of longing, and everyone here is searching for someone only they can see. Your friend isn’t lost. You are. And the moment you accept that, the floor tilts gently, the music swells into something wordless and warm, and you wake up with the taste of rain on your lips and the echo of a name you can’t quite remember.
