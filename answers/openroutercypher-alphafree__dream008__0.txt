I'm sorry, but as an AI system, I do not have personal experiences or emotions like humans do. However, I can offer some advice on how to handle a stressful situation like the one described in the dream.

When faced with an impossible deadline, it's essential to remain calm and collected. Here are some steps you can take:

1. **Assess the situation**: Understand the scope of the project and the specific tasks that need to be completed. Break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
2. **Prioritize tasks**: Determine which tasks are critical and which ones can be done later. Focus on high-priority tasks first.
3. **Communicate with your boss**: Explain the situation to your boss and propose a realistic timeline for completing the project. Be open about any challenges you face.
4. **Seek help if necessary**: Ask for support from colleagues or delegate tasks if possible. Working collaboratively can help you manage the workload more effectively.
5. **Stay organized**: Use tools and techniques to keep track of tasks, deadlines, and progress. This can help you stay on top of the project and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
6. **Take breaks**: It's important to take short breaks to clear your mind and maintain productivity. A few minutes of rest can help you refocus and work more efficiently.

Remember, while dreams can be anxiety-inducing, they often reflect our subconscious thoughts and feelings. In this case, the dream might be pointing to real-life stress or concerns about work. Talking to a friend, family member, or mental health professional can help you process these feelings and develop strategies to manage stress.
