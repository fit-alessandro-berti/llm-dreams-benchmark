You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to **wander** through streets that pulse like veins, each building a different shade of midnight glass that reflects your own face back at you, fragmented and shimmering. A trolley whirs past, but instead of wheels it rides on ribbons of light that curl and untwist, leaving a faint scent of cinnamon in the air. The people you pass are silhouettes made of paper—thin, delicate, with words written on their chests that shift and rewrite themselves as they move: “lost”, “searching”, “remember”.

You turn a corner and the city opens up into a plaza that feels like the inside of a giant watch—gear‑cogs turning slowly, clocks dripping like soft cheese, time itself wobbling. In the center stands a towering fountain, but the water is made of tiny, luminous letters that rise and fall in perfect rhythm, spelling out passages from a book you can’t quite recall. A faint voice calls your name from somewhere above, but when you look up, the sky is a deep indigo canvas brushed with constellations that form the logo of the company you’re supposed to meet. The stars rearrange themselves, pointing a bright, sputtering arrow toward a narrow alley draped in velvet curtains of midnight blue.

Summoning the courage of a child who knows no limits, you step into the alley. The curtains part like the pages of a secret diary, revealing an intimate café that feels both familiar and foreign—all the tables are made of polished river stones, and the barista is a silver fox with amber eyes, polishing a steaming cup made of crystal. He slides the cup toward you without a word, and as you sip, the liquid tastes of rain‑kissed pine and old memories. The steam rises and condenses into a holographic map that hovers above the cup, pulsing a gentle blue glow. The meeting location materializes: **Room 7B, 12th floor, The Atrium of Echoes**. You feel a sudden surge of clarity, as if the city itself has whispered the answer to you.

You stand, thank the fox, and step back onto the cobblestones that have now turned to polished mahogany. The streets straighten, the ribbons of light become a clear, straight path, and the towering watch plaza smooths into a glass elevator that descends with a soft sigh. As you approach the elevator doors, they open onto a familiar office building—your own building, the one you left for work this morning—except every window is a portal showing a different version of yourself, all nodding in approval. You step inside, the doors close behind you, and the city fades like a dream you’re just beginning to remember. The meeting is no longer an anxiety‑filled unknown; it’s a reminder that even in the most bewildering labyrinths, your intuition can draw the map.
