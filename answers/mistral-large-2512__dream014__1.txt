**The Dream Continues…**

You hesitate for a moment—trust doesn’t come easily in this city of flickering neon and hurried footsteps—but their eyes are warm, their voices gentle. One of them, a woman with a scarf the color of twilight, presses a small, folded map into your hands. *"We’ve all been lost here before,"* she says, as if that’s reason enough to believe her.

The group leads you through winding alleys where the air smells of rain and something sweet, like caramelized sugar from a street vendor’s cart. The city’s noise fades into a hum, as if the buildings themselves are leaning in to listen. A man with a guitar slung over his shoulder starts playing a melody that tugs at something deep in your chest—*you’ve heard this song before, but where?* The others hum along, their voices weaving into the music like threads in a tapestry.

Then, the woman with the scarf points upward. Above the rooftops, the sky is splitting open—not with storm clouds, but with light. A path of glowing stones unfurls in the air, leading toward a bridge made of something like glass and starlight. *"That’s where you’re meant to go,"* she says. *"But you don’t have to walk it alone."*

One by one, the strangers step onto the bridge with you. The guitar player’s song grows louder, the humming becomes a chorus, and suddenly, you realize: *they’re not leading you out of the city. They’re walking with you into something new.*

The bridge hums beneath your feet, warm and steady. The city below blurs into a sea of lights, but up here, the air is clear. You glance at the faces beside you—some familiar now, some still strangers—and for the first time in a long time, the weight in your chest lifts.

Then, the woman with the scarf smiles. *"See? You were never lost. You were just waiting for the right people to find you."*

And just like that, the dream shifts—because dreams always do. The bridge stretches onward, the music swells, and you step forward, not knowing where it leads, but certain you’re exactly where you’re supposed to be.

**Would you like to explore what happens next?** (A door appears at the end of the bridge? The strangers reveal they’re not strangers at all? The city below starts to… *sing*?)
