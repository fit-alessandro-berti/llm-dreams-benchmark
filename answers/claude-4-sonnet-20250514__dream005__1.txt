...and each group seems to be speaking in a language that shifts and changes as you approach. The words start as familiar English, but by the time you're close enough to join the conversation, they've morphed into something incomprehensible—not quite foreign, but like words you should know but have forgotten.

You walk past a circle of people laughing at what seems like the funniest joke in the world, their faces bright with joy, but when you try to smile along, their expressions suddenly turn serious and they all look at you with mild disappointment, as if you've interrupted something sacred.

The room keeps expanding. What started as a living room now has hallways that stretch impossibly long. You catch glimpses of your friend—or someone who might be your friend—always just around the next corner, always disappearing as you approach.

Your shoes feel wrong. Looking down, you realize you're wearing mismatched sneakers that are somehow both too big and too small. Other people glide effortlessly across the floor while you struggle with each step, the ground feeling like thick honey.

Finally, you spot your friend clearly across what is now a vast ballroom. You wave enthusiastically, and they wave back with a warm smile. But as you move toward them, weaving between dancing couples and floating conversations, you realize you can't remember their name, or even exactly why you came here to find them in the first place.
