…as you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns etched into its surface—swirling spirals that seem to shift when you’re not looking directly at them. The metal feels warm, almost alive, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat beneath your fingertips. You trace one of the spirals absentmindedly, and suddenly, the lines begin to glow with a soft, silver light.

Startled, you pull back—but the glow spreads, connecting each pattern like constellations coming to life. A low hum fills the air, growing steadily louder. The box isn’t metal at all, you realize—it’s made of something older, something grown rather than forged. The seams along its edges begin to part, not with a click, but with a sound like a whisper in a language you’ve never heard, yet somehow understand.

*"Only the dreamer can open what memory has sealed."*

You hesitate. Inside, you know, isn’t a key, or a weapon, or a treasure of gold. It’s something forgotten—something you left behind, buried deep in the layers of sleep and silence. The lid lifts on its own, revealing not darkness, but a mirror: your reflection, younger, eyes full of questions you once asked before the world told you to stop.

And then, softly, it speaks your name—not the one you use now, but the one you whispered to the stars as a child. You reach in… not to take, but to remember.
