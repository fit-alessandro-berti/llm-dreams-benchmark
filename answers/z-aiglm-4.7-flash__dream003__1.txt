...intricate patterns and pulsing veins of silver light. They don’t look like carvings, but like veins—capillaries that throb in time with my own heartbeat. The wood is impossibly old, smelling faintly of ozone and cold rain. I realize then that I don’t need a key to get in. I don't need to pry or force it open.

I lean closer, my breath puffing gently against the lock, and the silver veins ripple outward like a stone dropped in a dark pond. A soft, mechanical *click* vibrates through my fingertips. The lid hasn't opened by lifting; it has folded back on itself like the petals of a blooming flower.

Inside, there is no treasure, no gold, and no gemstones. There is only a single, glowing marble sitting on a bed of black velvet, floating just inches above the wood. As I reach in to touch it, the box vanishes, the velvet turns to smoke, and I feel the rush of the wind again as I begin to fall.
