**Dream Completion:**

The deck heaves violently beneath your feet as another monstrous wave crashes over the bow, the icy water stinging your face. The crew's eyes lock onto yours, wide with fear, but beneath that fear—a flicker of trust. The storm screams in your ears, but in your chest, a steady drumbeat of resolve drowns it out.  

You grip the wheel, your knuckles whitening, and bellow commands above the roar: **"Secure the rigging! Batten the hatches! Steady as she goes!"** The crew springs into motion, their panic tempered by purpose. Lightning forks across the sky, illuminating a jagged reef to starboard—and beyond it, a faint, golden glow. *A lighthouse.*  

"Hard to port!" you shout, wrenching the wheel as the ship groans in protest. The hull scrapes against rock, the sound like teeth grinding, but the vessel holds. The crew scrambles, adjusting sails with frenzied precision. Waves tower like liquid mountains, but you chart a serpentine path through them, guided by that distant beacon.  

Just as the storm's fury peaks, a rogue wall of water looms, poised to swallow the ship whole. Your voice cuts through the chaos: **"Brace!"** The crew clings to whatever they can—ropes, masts, each other—and for a heartbeat, the world dissolves into froth and darkness.  

Then—silence.  

The ship surges forward, the storm’s wrath fading behind you. The lighthouse beam washes over the deck, warm and steady. The crew erupts in ragged cheers, their exhaustion mingling with awe. You don’t smile yet—the sea is never truly conquered—but you tighten your grip on the wheel and set a course for the horizon, where the first hints of dawn bleed into the clouds.  

The storm hasn’t won. *Not today.*
