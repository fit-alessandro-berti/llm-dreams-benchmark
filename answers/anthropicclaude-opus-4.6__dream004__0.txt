# The Dream of the Living Canvas

You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and a brush that hovers in midair, dripping with a pigment you've never seen before — somewhere between violet and a sound, like the hum of a cello string made visible.

You reach for the brush, and the moment your fingers close around it, you feel a pulse travel up your arm and settle behind your eyes.

You paint a single stroke.

The line *breathes*. It peels itself off the canvas and stretches into three dimensions, becoming a doorway — an arch of liquid color that frames a world within a world. Through it, you see a city made entirely of origami, its paper towers folding and unfolding in slow, deliberate rhythm like the breathing of something ancient.

You step through.

The moment your foot touches the paper ground, the city responds. Streets rearrange themselves beneath you, folding into staircases that spiral upward into a sky that isn't a sky at all — it's another canvas, and someone on the other side is painting *you*.

You look down at your hands. They're becoming brushstrokes. Your edges are softening, your body loosening into whorls of color.

And you realize — with a calm that only makes sense in dreams — that you were never the artist.

You were always the painting.

The canvas you found wasn't blank. It was *waiting*. And now, stroke by dissolving stroke, you are finally becoming complete — filling in the last empty space with the only pigment that was ever missing:

*yourself.*

The world flashes white. Then every color at once.

Then you wake — with the faint smell of wet paint lingering on your fingertips and a strange certainty that somewhere, on a canvas you'll never find again, your portrait is still drying.
