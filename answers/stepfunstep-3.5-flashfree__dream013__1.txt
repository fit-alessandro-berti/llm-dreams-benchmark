...find your own thoughts becoming part of the labyrinth’s architecture. The walls, once stone, now seem woven from half-remembered conversations and unsolved problems from your waking life. Each puzzle you solve doesn’t open a path—it rearranges the maze around you, folding corridors into themselves like a Moebius strip.

The final chamber has no door. It’s a silent room with a single, smooth pedestal. On it rests a mirror, but instead of your reflection, it shows the maze from a bird’s-eye view—a living, shifting diagram of every choice you made to get here. The puzzle is this: to leave, you must point out the one turn you *didn’t* take, the path that was always possible but never chosen.

As you reach for the memory, the mirror ripples. The maze dissolves not into an exit, but into the blank page of a notebook. The final puzzle was never in the labyrinth. It was the act of dreaming itself—and the question it leaves behind, hovering in the quiet of your sleeping mind, is whether you have the courage to solve it when you wake.
