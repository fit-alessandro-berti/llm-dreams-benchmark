*settling into the dream space*

I decide to **stop mid-sentence.**

The words I was about to say—sharp ones, the kind designed to win rather than understand—they dissolve on my tongue like sugar in rain.

I notice my friend's hands. They're trembling slightly. I've never noticed that before during our arguments.

The room around us shifts, the way rooms do in dreams. The walls become transparent, and I can see we're actually standing on a narrow bridge over dark water. I realize the bridge is made of all the conversations we've ever had—some planks sturdy, some rotting, some missing entirely.

I sit down on the bridge. Right there. Cross-legged.

\ don't want to be right,\ myself say. \ to still know you on the other side of this.\ face does something complicated. In the dream-logic way, I can suddenly see the argument from behind their eyes—not the words, but the *fear* underneath. It looks different from there.

The dark water below us starts glowing, faintly, with bioluminescence.

They sit down too.

We don't solve anything yet. But we're sitting now instead of standing, and the bridge feels more solid underneath us.

*What happens next in the dream?*
