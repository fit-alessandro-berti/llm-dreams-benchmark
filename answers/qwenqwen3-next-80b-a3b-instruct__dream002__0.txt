You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching — not with thunder or wind, but with silence. The birds stop singing. The leaves freeze mid-quiver. The air thickens, heavy with the scent of ozone and burnt sugar.

Then the trees begin to whisper.

Not in voices you can understand, but in patterns — shapes forming in the mist between the trunks, impressions of faces, hands, forgotten names. Your feet no longer feel the moss. You’re walking on memory.

Above you, the sky splits open — not with rain, but with falling letters. Ancient, glowing script drifts down like snowflakes, each one a word you once loved, or feared, or buried. *Enough.* *Forgive.* *Remember.* *You were loved.*

A figure emerges beneath the canopy — not human, not animal, but woven from bark and twilight. It holds out a lantern made of woven moonlight.

“You’ve been waiting for this,” it says, not in words, but in the rhythm of your heartbeat.

You reach for the lantern… and realize it’s yours. It was always yours. The storm wasn’t coming to destroy.

It was coming to return you.

The forest exhales. The trees bow.

And for the first time in years — maybe ever — you let yourself cry.

When you open your eyes, you’re still standing under the same oak. The sky is sunny. A single glowing letter drifts onto your palm.

It reads: *Safe.*

And somewhere deep within the woods, a branch snaps — softly.

Like someone saying goodbye.

Or hello.
