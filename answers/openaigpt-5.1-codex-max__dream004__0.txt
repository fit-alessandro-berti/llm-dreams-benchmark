and find that your fingers have already become the brush. When you touch the surface, it isn't white anymore — it stretches like the skin of a drum and pulses with the kaleidoscope around you. Each thought that flits through your head becomes a streak: a line of liquid gold that curls into a spiral, a dot that blooms into a floating flower made of glass.

Whatever you paint does not stay on the flat plane. A cobalt hill you sketch puffs up and rolls off the canvas, settling into the changing horizon. A door that begins as a rectangle swings open, revealing itself in midair, and a gentle breeze scented like burnt sugar spills out. Curious, you paint a sun with turquoise rays, and overhead the sky obligingly shifts, trading its shifting pastels for that strange new hue.

As you work, you realize the canvas is not just accepting your marks but offering them back. Shapes you didn't intend grow in the margins, curling letters you can't read write themselves along the edges. The canvas tilts, enlarges, until you cannot tell where it ends and the world begins. You paint a path and feel it form under your feet; you paint wings and feel them unfurl from your shoulders.

There is a moment of vertigo as you step through the doorway you made, leaving behind the place of perpetual change for a room filled with stillness. In the center is another blank canvas, smaller, on a table. You smile, pick it up, and on its back is an inscription in your own handwriting: "You are dreaming. Paint wisely."
