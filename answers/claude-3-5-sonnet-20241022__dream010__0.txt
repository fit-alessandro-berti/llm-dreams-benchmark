I'll continue this dream scenario:

You face various challenges and each one becomes increasingly surreal. In the first challenge, you must give a presentation while the room slowly fills with floating jellyfish made of light. Somehow, this feels completely normal in the dream.

The second challenge takes place in an ever-shifting office where the walls breathe and the desk you're working at keeps transforming into different materials - first glass, then water, then clouds. Your competitors are there too, but they keep morphing into different versions of themselves.

In the final challenge, you find yourself in what appears to be your ideal workplace, but everything is slightly off. The coffee machine dispenses liquid starlight, your potential coworkers are all wearing masks that show their true thoughts, and your interviewer is simultaneously every boss you've ever had.

Just as you're about to learn if you've won the competition, you realize that you've been the hiring manager all along, and you must decide whether to hire yourself. The other candidates transform into different versions of your past and future selves, all waiting for your decision...

How would you like this dream to end?
