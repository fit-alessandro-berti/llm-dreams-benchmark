You start to wander through wide avenues and crowded streets, feeling both the urgency of your deadline and the disorienting strangeness of this city. Overhead, the sky is a dusky violet, as if it’s early evening or perhaps perpetually twilight. The buildings are immense, covered in patterns of filigreed metal and shimmering tiles, and every so often one of them emits the low hum of hidden machinery. You can’t tell what language the signs are in—some kind of script that shifts when you try to focus on it—but you have a feeling the meeting is critical, something that could open doors for you. Or maybe close them, if you fail to arrive on time.

You weave through the crowd, pausing people at random, asking for directions. Each person you approach seems to vanish into the throng the moment you finish speaking, as if they can’t be bothered with you. You try to read their faces, but most wear masks: some are elegant, made of carved wood and painted in subdued hues; others are sleek, mirrored ovals that reflect your face back at you, distorted and anxious. When you get an answer, it’s always half-formed: someone might gesture vaguely “over there” before disappearing, or mutter a name of a street you immediately forget. The city feels like it’s shifting under your feet, its geometry fluid.

The press of the crowd leads you to a central plaza full of tall, willowy trees—each leaf the size of your hand and glowing softly from within, giving the space a gentle, lambent light. In the center of this plaza stands a towering sculpture of interlocking spheres, and at its base, a cluster of people in robes seem to debate quietly. You approach them and try to ask for directions, but a hush falls as soon as you open your mouth. They turn as one, their eyes all fixed on you, and then one steps forward. Her voice is low and melodic. “You must find the Citadel of Bridges,” she says. “That is where your meeting will take place.” Her companions nod solemnly, as if affirming some great and mysterious truth.

You have never heard of this Citadel, but your intuition says it’s important. You thank them, though they remain silent, and head off in the direction they seem to be pointing. Now the city’s mood changes slightly. The winding streets narrow. The buildings, once tall and luminous, become more modest and cramped. Vendors hawk strange wares from carts: crystal spheres that shift color with your breath, mechanical birds that chirp in languages you don’t recognize. You begin to notice subtle guiding signs: a painted symbol on a doorframe that looks like a bridge arch, a whispered word from someone passing by, a gust of wind that seems to point you around a corner.

Gradually, the roads begin to rise and intersect at odd angles, becoming a network of ramps and walkways, some arching above others. It is as if you’ve climbed into a place between rooftops and sky. You look down and realize you’re now walking on a glass pathway that reveals multiple layers of the city below—streets within streets, plazas you had no idea existed, canals of shimmering water crisscrossing underground. High above, cables stretch across the horizon, connecting distant towers. You sense time slipping away. That hour you had is surely almost spent.

Finally, you see it: a grand structure suspended between four mighty towers, each tower carved with intricate patterns that remind you of ancient scripts. The Citadel of Bridges, it must be. It’s neither building nor bridge alone, but a great lattice of passages and halls floating in midair. Ornate lanterns swing in a gentle breeze, illuminating a central entrance flanked by two attendants. You approach them, heart pounding, and they calmly ask for your name. When you give it, they nod, stepping aside as if you were expected.

Inside, corridors unfold and twist in impossible ways. You follow a faint sound—a sort of chiming bell—and turn into a long hall lined with reflective surfaces. Each mirror-like wall shows a different version of you, dressed differently, holding different objects, sometimes accompanied by other people. You feel the pull of these reflections, as if they represent possible futures. But you must focus. Your meeting awaits.

At the end of the hall, a door with no handle slowly swings open as you approach. You enter a circular chamber where a single chair sits facing a window made of stained glass. The sky outside has darkened to a deep indigo, and stars pulse and shimmer, impossibly close. Someone steps forward from the shadows: their face is familiar but you can’t quite place it. A mentor, a colleague, an old friend from long ago?

They speak softly. “We’ve been waiting for you. The terms are delicate, and this meeting is crucial.” They gesture to the chair, inviting you to sit. You have no idea what the terms refer to—business, art, a personal quest? Yet, as you take your seat, an odd calm settles over you. You realize that, though you’ve been uncertain and lost, you’ve been guided here all along. The city’s shifting streets, the silent nods of strangers, the cryptic clues—they all led you to this room, this conversation.

As the meeting begins, the words you need come to you easily, as if pulled from the very dream’s tapestry. Outside, the city hums softly, and the dream landscape pulses with a gentle life, waiting patiently for what comes next.
