...build a greenhouse.

In this dream, I find myself drawn to the abandoned botanical garden on the city's outskirts. Most survivors have fortified themselves in buildings or scavenged what they can, but something compels me to clear the rubble from the glass dome instead.

My hands blister as I work, but there's a strange comfort in the rhythm of cleaning, planting, nurturing. Seeds from the old world still viable in the soil, sprouting green defiance against the gray landscape.

Other survivors eventually find me - first curious, then grateful when the first tomatoes ripen. What started as survival becomes something more: hope cultivated like crops, community grown from shared soil.

The dream feels vivid, the dirt under my fingernails and the weight of possibility in each seed packet. Even in ruins, life finds a way - and sometimes, that way is through gardens.

What would you have done in this post-apocalyptic dream? I'm curious where your own instincts for survival and rebuilding might lead you.
