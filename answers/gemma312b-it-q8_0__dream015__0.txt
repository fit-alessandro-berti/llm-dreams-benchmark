You find yourself in a post-apomorphic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to ... nurture. Not scrap, not loot, not hoard. But nurture. Specifically, you focus on a tangled thicket barely clawing existence in a collapsed apartment complex. It’s surprisingly bursting with tenacious green – wild raspberry bushes interwoven with climbing vines and something that looks disturbingly like dandelions, only far taller and stronger than any you’d seen before the Fall.

It started simple. Watering. Collecting dew, filtering rainwater through charcoal fashioned from scavenged building debris, bringing it drop by precious drop to the thirsting plants. At first, other wanderers laughed. “You'd waste it on *weeds*, human? People are starvin’!” They’d eye the plump red berries, their faces pinched with longing. But you just kept watering, humming a half-remembered nursery rhyme as you did.

As the raspberries thrive, they draw scavengers too—not just desperate people hunting for a sweet treat, but rust-coloured rats whose numbers dwindled when you introduced ladybugs you’s found amongst the ruins of a botanical archive. You realize a symbiotic relationship is bubbling between them. Even a mangy, limping wolf pup avoids the thorns, content to lie nearby, instinctively understanding the burgeoning safety the plants offer.

More than just the fruit, though, seeds. Everywhere, little green dots, brimming with the promise of more. You start carefully tending to them, moving them to safer spots when possible. Tiny plots, guarded by thorny vines, blooming with the unexpected. Some plants produce berries sweeter and richer than the raspberries. Other reveal small potatoes. Then fragrant herbs that ease the chronic coughing and weakness gripping many survivors. 

A flicker. Another person wanders into your oasis, younger, thin, with hopeless eyes. They glare at the growing tangle. “Why bother?”

You stop watering. Handing them a single, perfect raspberry, warm from the weak sunlight. “Because,” you said without ceremony, “it gives us something worth protecting. It reminds us there's still life. It shows me this world still wants to grow.” and you offer them the shovel. 

Then you notice details you hadn’t before. A faint, shimmering light emanating from the center of the thickened vines. Not an ordinary glow, but almost… *biological*. A hum starts – subtle, beneath the constant wind that whistles through the ruins – a vibrant pulse resonating in the leaves. A single, colossal bloom bursts into view in the very heart of the thicket. It's a flower of unimaginable size and color – deep aquamarine edged with threads of silver, pulsing slowly – spreading a gentle, sweet aroma that stills the anxiety that had clung so tightly to you all these years. You realize that nurturing had somehow… activated something. Opened a dormant potential. This was more than botany.

The child looks astonished. And then a laugh, a brief and precious sound in the silent wasteland. The child runs towards the strange blossom, reaching a tiny hand towards. Then… your vision starts to fade as a shimmering, warm, blue light envelops you and with it the faint sound of rain.
