…look for anything with a name, a sign, a landmark, a clue. The street numbers refuse to line up. They skip like bad radio. On one corner, the light says WALK; on the next, it says WAIT; on the third, it says REMEMBER, which isn’t helpful, because you can’t remember where you’re supposed to be.

You pat your pockets. Your phone is there, blessedly, but when you wake the screen the clock reads **59:59**, then **59:58**, ticking down from an hour that feels like a dare. You try to open your calendar, but the icons slide as if on ice; the “Appointments” app ducks left and vanishes into a folder called “Later.” The map app opens itself instead and begins to draw a route to **Somewhere**. It zooms in on your shoes.

You look up. The city is a grid that won’t sit still, streets bending as if you’re looking through heat. Buildings carry different faces each time you blink: a bank becomes a museum becomes a bakery that sells clocks instead of bread. People pass you with purposeful strides and no faces you can keep long enough to ask for help. You stop a man with a briefcase.

“Excuse me, where’s the—” you begin.

He opens the briefcase. Inside is a stack of paper clocks, each with little hands that tremble. He offers you one like a business card. “It starts at the top of the hour,” he says, and then falls upward into an elevator that appears around him and zips horizontally down the street.

You choose the oldest trick: a taxi. One materializes at the curb with a politely theatrical chirp. The driver is a woman with hair like wires and the calm of someone who has never been late. “Where to?” she asks.

You give her what you have: “I have a meeting in an hour. Important.”

She nods, flips the meter on. It begins counting backward from a number you don’t recognize. “That narrows it down,” she says, and pulls into traffic. You watch the city shuffle. A river you hadn’t noticed runs beside the road, smooth and bright, with boats moving like punctuation marks. Bridges cross it at odd angles and end on rooftops. The driver takes a turn that feels like a decision.

“Do you know where it is?” you ask.

“I know where everything is,” she says. “I don’t know where anything belongs.”

You pass an enormous map mounted to a plaza wall: colored lines for train routes, each labeled with verbs—DECIDE, DELAY, DEPART. You bang on the window. “Can we stop there?”

She obliges. You stand before the map and the map regards you. You trace the red line—DECIDE—to a station called **Soon**. The blue line—DELAY—loops around and around a gray circle named **Administration**. The green line—DEPART—goes off the edge of the map and keeps going. In the bottom right corner, in small print, it reads: *All appointments are at **Now**. Transfers required.*

You laugh, then almost cry. Your phone says **52:13**. A crowd floods the square. They gather beneath a clock tower whose hands are hesitant, like a shy conversation. A woman selling paper cups of rainwater tells you the station is under the clock. “They moved the entrance last fall,” she says. “You can only reach it if you go straight. No diagonals.”

You try straight. The streets keep persuading you to bend. Shops lean their windows toward you, smelling of starch and newness. A bookstore window displays only one title over and over: **Directions for People Already There**. You walk until your feet argue with your calves. You reach a staircase that goes both up and down at once. You take the middle and arrive in a hallway where every door is labeled with a feeling. You choose **Urgent**.

Inside is a small, careful room. A friendly person at a desk smiles the way a person smiles when they know something you’re about to learn. “Welcome,” they say. “Name?”

You give your name. They search a ledger so large it seems to require plural wrists. “Ah,” they say, and spin the book so you can see. Your name appears, written neatly beside a time: **Now**. The location field says **Here**. The meeting subject line reads: *You.*

“That can’t be right,” you say. “I’m meeting someone about something. It’s important.”

“Yes,” the person at the desk agrees. “It is.”

“Where do I go?”

They gesture to a chair against the wall. “Sit.”

“But I have—”

“You do,” they say. “You have this.” They point to the chair again, as if it were obvious. On the chair lies a folded piece of paper. You unfold it. It’s a map of the city, but unlike the one in the square, this one is made of rooms. **Breakfast** connects to **The Street Where You Thought of Your Friend**, which leads to **The Moment You Chose the Other Line**, which leads to **Here**. There are coffee stains along the route and a doodle of a small animal you used to draw in the margins when you weren’t paying attention in school.

Your phone says **41:02**, then **40:61**, then **40:60**, making a point.

“Who am I meeting?” you ask, softer now.

The door on the other side of the room opens. The person who steps in looks like you after a full night’s sleep, which is to say not exactly like you. They are wearing a version of your favorite shirt from a time you forgot was your favorite. They sit in the chair across from you and tilt their head the way you do when you’re trying to focus without making it look like work.

“Hi,” this you says. “Thanks for coming.”

You want to explain you tried a taxi, you tried a map, you tried to go straight when diagonals insisted. You manage only, “I didn’t know where to go.”

“That’s why we meet here,” they say. “Here is easy to find once you stop looking everywhere else.”

You are annoyed at the fortune-cookie neatness of that. You are relieved anyway. You look down at the paper map again. On the back, in your handwriting from three apartments ago, there is a note: *If you forget, wait. You will remember.*

The other you is watching you with a patience you reserve for strangers on long flights. “So,” they say. “Agenda?”

You shrug. “I have an hour.”

“Good,” they say. “Let’s spend it.” They lay a small object on the table between you: a compass whose needle refuses to settle. “Tell me three places you don’t want to be,” they say. You do. “Tell me one place you wouldn’t mind.” You do. “Tell me what hurts when you imagine going where you’d rather.” You try. The needle twitches and, just once, faces north.

You talk until the clock in the corner clears its throat and begins to speak in time again. You laugh once. You apologize to yourself for the miles you put in today chasing a meeting that was waiting in a chair. The other you forgives you before you finish the sentence.

Your phone exhales and says **01:01** and then **01:00** and then ignores numbers, reverting to a blank face that shows you your own. The person at the desk brings you two small paper cups of rainwater. You drink. It tastes like the first five minutes after it stops raining.

Outside, the city keeps doing what cities do: yawning, blinking, dissolving, reassembling. When you rise, the door opens onto a street you recognize for no good reason. The sigh of buses makes sense. The light says WALK and means it. The appointment was not missed. It was kept.

On your way out you pass the plaza again. The wall map has calmed down. A small sticker has been added over the station called **Now**. It says **You Are Here** in a handwriting you know.

You put your phone away. It’s suddenly heavy and quiet. You don’t check the time. You don’t need to. You step into the street and the city finally lets you go exactly where you are.
