...find that the puzzles are becoming increasingly difficult and intricate. I'm walking through a long, winding corridor with stone walls and a cold, tile floor. The air is musty and filled with the scent of old books and dust.

As I turn a corner, I see a large, ornate door with a sign that reads "Puzzle 3: The Mirrored Labyrinth." I push the door open, and a warm, golden light spills out, illuminating the dark corridor.

Inside, I find myself in a large, hexagonal room with six identical doors, each one leading to a different path. The walls are lined with mirrors, and the floor is covered in a complex pattern of tiles with strange symbols etched into them.

Suddenly, a low, whispery voice speaks to me from the shadows, saying, "To escape this room, you must use the mirrors to reveal the hidden pattern on the floor. But be warned, the mirrors are not what they seem, and the reflections they show are not always truthful."

I look around and see that each mirror is angled in such a way that it reflects a different part of the room. I notice that some of the reflections show a path of tiles that seem to lead to a specific door, while others show a path that leads to a dead end.

I realize that I need to use the mirrors to my advantage, but I'm not sure which reflections to trust. I start to experiment, moving around the room and adjusting the mirrors to see which reflections change and which ones remain the same.

As I work on the puzzle, I hear the whispery voice again, saying, "The truth is not always reflected, but it is always hidden in plain sight." I'm not sure what this means, but I have a feeling that it's a crucial clue.

After several minutes of intense concentration, I finally notice a subtle pattern in the reflections. I see that one of the mirrors is reflecting a virtual image of a tile that doesn't actually exist on the floor. I use this information to adjust the mirrors and reveal the hidden pattern.

As I step on the correct tile, the floor slides open, revealing a hidden staircase that leads deeper into the maze. I feel a rush of excitement and relief, knowing that I've overcome another challenge.

But as I descend the staircase, I hear the whispery voice one last time, saying, "The next puzzle is waiting for you... and it's the most challenging one yet." I take a deep breath, steel myself for what's to come, and continue on my journey through the maze.
