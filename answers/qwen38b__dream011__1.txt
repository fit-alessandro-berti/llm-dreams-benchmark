You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a fluid, shifting script that seems to rewrite itself as you read them. The paper is warm to the touch, like skin, and the room around you hums with a low, resonant frequency.  

**Question 1:** *"What is the weight of a moment that changes everything?"*  
You stare at the blank space, realizing the answer isn’t numerical. The air thickens, and a faint whisper fills the room: *“Choose wisely, or the answer will choose you.”*  

**Question 2:** *"If you could erase one regret, would you? And if so, what would remain?"*  
A flicker of light appears above your desk, forming a mirror. In it, you see not your face, but a split image—the person you were, the person you might become, and a third figure, shadowy and trembling. The mirror shatters, and the room tilts.  

**Question 3:** *"What is the shape of your truth?"*  
The exam paper dissolves into smoke, coalescing into a labyrinth of glowing doors. Each door bears a label: *“Security,” “Purpose,” “Isolation,” “Connection,” “The Unasked Question.”* Behind one door, you hear laughter. Behind another, a heartbeat. Behind the last, silence.  

The clock on the wall begins to count backward. You feel your own pulse sync with it.  

**Final Question:** *"What do you want to remember when the dream ends?"*  
You close your eyes. The labyrinth dissolves, and you’re back in your room, the exam paper now a blank page. Your hand hovers, and suddenly, the words *“You are the answer”* appear, glowing faintly.  

When you wake, the room is quiet. But in your mind, the questions linger—no longer as barriers, but as invitations. The exam wasn’t about choosing a career. It was about choosing *how* to live.  

And the dream? It was just the beginning.
