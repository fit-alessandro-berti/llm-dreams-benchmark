…and you find yourself standing before a massive, wall-sized calendar, the days stretching on into the distance like a corridor of dates and deadlines. Each box is filled with dense scribbles and color-coded notes that bleed into one another, as if the ink itself is panicking on your behalf. Your boss—her face blurred, yet familiar—peers over your shoulder, wordlessly urging you onward. Her presence is heavy, pressing down on you like an invisible hand.

As you turn back to your workstation, you realize your desk is no longer where it should be. Instead, it’s suspended from the ceiling by thick, industrial chains. The room itself seems to have tripled in size, becoming more like a warehouse than an office. Thin beams of fluorescent light flicker overhead, casting jittery shadows on rows upon rows of filing cabinets, each one jammed with papers you’ll need to review. You hear the distant hum of machines—printers, copiers, shredders—like a swarm of mechanical bees.

Time warps. Your watch face is blurry, its hands spinning too fast, then freezing. You try to access your computer, but when you lift the keyboard cover, you find it’s just a thin layer of cardboard, painted to look like keys. You press where the letters should be, and nothing happens. Panicking, you look up to see your boss tapping her foot, her glare sharpening even without distinct features. You feel the silent question: “When will you start?”

You turn around and spot a narrow ladder leaning against a towering bookcase filled with binders. Each binder is labeled with a part of the project that needs completion—concept sketches, feasibility reports, manufacturing timelines—but as soon as you reach for one, the ladder wobbles dangerously. The files you do manage to pull free turn blank as you hold them, their lettering vanishing, leaving you with page after page of meaningless white.

A strange buzzing sound draws your attention to a cluster of monitors floating freely in midair. They display your coworkers, who appear to be working in fast-forward, their hands a blur at their desks. Each time you shout for help, they freeze, their eyes going hollow, then resume their frantic pace as if you never spoke.

You feel the weight of an invisible clock ticking inside your chest. The idea of starting—truly starting—becomes more and more impossible. And yet, you notice something odd: the chain holding your desk begins to sway, lowering gently, as if encouraging you to sit. Tentatively, you settle into a chair that appears the moment you need it. Your computer screen flickers to life, the keyboard solidifies, and you place your fingers on the keys.

Your boss leans in, and you suddenly catch a glimpse of compassion—or maybe just desperation—behind the blur. You realize that the project is not meant to be completed in the conventional sense. This entire scenario is a test of your composure under impossible conditions. You take a breath, ignoring the towering bookcases, the blinking monitors, the hum of the machines. Instead, you focus on the idea of moving forward, one keystroke at a time.

As your fingers begin to type, paragraphs appear—clear, coherent, and purposeful. The swirling ink and drifting piles of paper calm into neat stacks. You notice that each sentence you write pulls the impossible deadline a little closer to something manageable. The blurred face of your boss softens, the fluorescent lights steady, and the suspended desk eases down until it’s safely on the floor.

Just as you feel the tension leaving your shoulders, the edges of your vision begin to haze. The office dimly flickers, as if someone is turning down the brightness on a screen. With each word you type, the dream simplifies, becomes gentler, until finally the scene dissolves into warm light. You’re left with a calm sense that maybe this was never about meeting the deadline at all, but about discovering your own resilience in the face of the impossible.
