You start to pick your way through a maze of narrow alleys, the pavement beneath your feet shifting from smooth marble to moss‑covered cobblestones with every step. The buildings loom overhead, their windows glowing in colors you’ve never seen—jewel‑green, bruised purple, liquid gold. You realize the city seems alive: at times the streetlamps lean close, as if whispering directions; at others, the façades ripple like water, erasing doors and creating new corridors.

Around you, people drift by in elegant silence, their faces half‑hidden beneath broad hats or veils made of shifting fog. You approach one figure—a woman with lantern‑eyes—hoping to ask where your meeting is. She raises a finger, and the lantern in her palm spills a map of thread‑bare roads that float into the sky like constellations. Before you can read the pattern, a breeze unravels it, scattering silver lines across the clouds.

Your watch, which you thought had stopped, suddenly ticks forward five minutes. Panic burrows in your chest. You sprint down a staircase that droops impossibly to the right, handrails twisting like vines. At the bottom, you find a street vendor selling tiny glass orbs. Each orb holds a single remembered moment—a laugh, a secret, a whispered promise. You press one to your forehead, and for an instant you see your own reflection, calm and certain, standing before a grand hall with columns of living flame.

Emboldened, you leave the vendor’s stall and cross a broad plaza where time seems to pool at your ankles. In the center stands a great clocktower, its hands spinning backward. You climb the steps, heart pounding, and at the summit discover a key carved from bone. Instinct urges you to turn it in the lock of a bronze door set into the tower’s base.

You turn the key—and the door dissolves into an archway of light. Through it you glimpse a room laid out like a familiar study: your desk, your chair, the framed photograph of someone you love. You step across the threshold, and the city falls away behind you. A gentle voice—your own—says, “Welcome. You’ve been late only by a dream’s measure.” As the door whispers shut you realize your meeting has nothing to do with place or time, but with something inside you, waiting patiently all along. At that moment you wake, the echo of lantern‑eyes still glowing behind your eyelids.
