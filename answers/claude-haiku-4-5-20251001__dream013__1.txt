# The Maze of Shifting Rules

...the puzzles begin to change their own rules.

At first, you solve them methodically—sliding blocks into place, arranging colored tiles. But then you notice something unsettling: a puzzle you solved five minutes ago has rearranged itself. The solution no longer works.

You push forward anyway, moving deeper. The walls begin to breathe. The logic puzzles give way to stranger challenges—you're asked to count colors that don't have names, or arrange numbers that keep moving like schools of fish. You're not sure if you're solving them anymore or if they're solving themselves around you.

Then the maze opens into a vast library where all the walls are made of papers covered in solutions. But they're solutions to *your* life—choices you could have made, conversations you almost had. You realize you're not trying to get *out* of the maze anymore; you're trying to find the moment you entered it.

An old puzzle sits on a pedestal, glowing faintly. It's the first one you solved, back at the entrance. You completed it perfectly. As you look at it now, the solution dissolves, and you understand:

*You were never solving the maze. The maze was solving you.*
