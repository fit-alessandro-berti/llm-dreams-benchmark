...and the wind whips through the trees, their leaves rustling like panicked whispers. The sky, once a gentle blue, darkens to a bruised purple, the sun swallowed by churning grey clouds.  A low rumble echoes through the forest, growing louder with each passing second. Raindrops, fat and cold, begin to splat on the leaves around me, quickly escalating into a torrential downpour.

I break into a run, searching desperately for shelter.  The path, muddy and slick, disappears beneath a torrent of water.  Lightning cracks the sky, illuminating the forest in a blinding white light, followed by the deafening crash of thunder that seems to shake the very ground I run on.  

Suddenly, I see it - a faint light flickering in the distance.  Hope surges through me and I push myself harder, ignoring the stinging rain and the biting wind.  As I get closer, I realize the light comes from a small, ramshackle cabin, nestled amongst the trees. Smoke curls from its chimney, promising warmth and dryness. 

I stumble towards the cabin, my breath ragged, and reach for the wooden door. It creaks open, revealing a dimly lit room with a roaring fire in a stone hearth. A figure sits hunched in a rocking chair, their back to me, seemingly oblivious to my presence. 

"Hello?" I call out, my voice hoarse.

The figure slowly turns, their face hidden in the shadows. And as they raise their head, I realize with a jolt that it's my own face staring back at me, older, weathered, with eyes that hold a depth of sadness I've never known.

The dream ends there, leaving me with a lingering feeling of unease and a profound sense of mystery.
