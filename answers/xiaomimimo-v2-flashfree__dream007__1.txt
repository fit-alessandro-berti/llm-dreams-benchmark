I decide to walk away. I turn my back on them, heading for a door that I know leads outside, hoping the fresh air will clear my head.

But as I reach for the handle, the hallway behind me suddenly begins to distort. The walls start to breathe, pulsing in and out like a giant lung. My friend’s voice is still arguing, but it’s no longer just words; it’s a low, vibrating hum that seems to be coming from the floorboards.

I turn the handle and step out, but I don’t step onto the street. I step onto the surface of a frozen lake under a sky that is the color of a bruised plum. The air is instantly freezing, but I don’t feel cold—only a deep, heavy silence.

My friend steps out of the door behind me, but they look different. Their face is made of shifting shadows, and their eyes are bright coins. They aren't angry anymore; they look sad.

They open their mouth to speak, and thousands of origami cranes fly out, filling the purple sky. As they flutter around us, the ice beneath my feet begins to crack, not into shards, but into a pattern of a large jigsaw puzzle. I look down and realize the pieces aren't showing water underneath, but memories—flashes of us laughing, playing, growing up together.

I reach out to grab my friend's hand, but as my fingers touch their shadow-arm, the dream dissolves into the sound of a ringing telephone, and I wake up.
