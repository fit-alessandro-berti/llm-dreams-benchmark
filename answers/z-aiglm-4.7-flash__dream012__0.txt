...and you tighten your grip on the wheel, feeling the raw wood grain vibrate against your palms like a frantic heartbeat. You don't shout orders to fight the waves; instead, you steer the ship hard into the wind, turning your back to the safety of the harbor. As the water begins to churn violently, you feel the mast groan and the rigging sing. Just as the crests tower over your head, you pull the starboard lever, and the hull suddenly lifts, gliding effortlessly over the churning foam as if it were waterfalls of solid light. The crew falls silent, watching in awe as you pilot the vessel across the face of the storm, flying not above the sea, but through the clouds, towards the moon.
