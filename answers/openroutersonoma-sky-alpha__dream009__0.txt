You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to adapt quickly to survive in this ancient world of towering stone temples and bustling markets alive with the clamor of merchants hawking spices and silks. The air is thick with the scent of incense and sun-baked earth, and the sun hangs low like a molten coin in a sky unmarred by contrails or satellites.

Your heart races as you wander through cobblestone streets lined with thatched-roof huts, where villagers in flowing robes eye you curiously—your modern clothes a glaring anomaly, like a glitch in the fabric of time. No smartphones to call for help, no GPS to guide you home; just the raw pulse of a world powered by muscle, wind, and fire. You spot a grand ziggurat in the distance, its steps crawling with priests in feathered headdresses, and a river teeming with reed boats ferrying goods under the watchful gaze of clay idols.

But as the day wears on and your stomach growls with unfamiliar hunger, the true realization hits: you need to blend in, learn the language of gestures and barters, and forge alliances to unravel the mystery of how you got here. Perhaps it's a dream woven by the gods themselves, or a rift in the oak roots of time—either way, survival means becoming one with this era. You approach a kindly old storyteller by a flickering fire, offering a trinket from your pocket (a forgotten keychain, oddly anachronistic), and begin your quest to find a way back... or maybe, just maybe, to stay.
