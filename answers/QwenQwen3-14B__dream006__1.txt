You begin to speak, your voice trembling slightly as you glance at the sea of faces before you. The air hums with an electric tension, as if the room itself is holding its breath. But as your words spill out—tentative at first, then gaining momentum—you notice something strange: the audience is not sitting still. Their heads are tilting at impossible angles, their eyes glinting with a silvery sheen, as though they’re not humans at all, but something… *other*.  

Your speech, which you’d rehearsed for weeks, slips from your mind. Instead, you find yourself speaking in a language you don’t recognize, your tongue forming sounds that ripple through the air like water. The words seem to *float* above your head, glowing faintly, and as they drift toward the crowd, the people begin to *change*. Their clothing dissolves into smoke, their bodies morphing into shapes—trees, birds, fragments of broken mirrors.  

You stumble back, heart racing, but the stage beneath you is no longer a stage. It’s a vast, shifting desert of glass, reflecting a thousand fractured skies. The microphone in your hand warps into a serpent, coiling around your wrist, its scales shimmering with constellations. You realize, with a mix of dread and awe, that your speech wasn’t about *anything*—it was about *becoming*.  

The crowd, now a murmuration of shadows and light, rises as one, their collective hum resonating in your bones. You open your mouth to speak again, but no words come. Instead, you feel yourself dissolving, too—your edges blurring, your thoughts unraveling into the dream’s endless, glittering void.  

And then, silence.  
The dream fades, leaving only the echo of a question:  
*Was this a speech… or a surrender?*
