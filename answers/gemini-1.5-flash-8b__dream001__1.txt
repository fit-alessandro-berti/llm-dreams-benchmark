You start to run, a frantic, stumbling sprint through towering, obsidian spires that scraped the bruised purple sky.  The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and something metallic, like old blood.  Narrow alleyways, choked with swirling mists that tasted like burnt sugar, twisted and turned, each corner revealing more perplexing architecture – buildings that looked like petrified waterfalls, others like frozen constellations.  Streetlights, flickering erratically, cast long, distorted shadows that danced with the mist.

Your breath comes in ragged gasps, your heart hammering against your ribs.  You pull out your phone, the screen displaying a distorted, blurry image of the meeting location – a swirling vortex of colours, completely unintelligible.  A voice, unfamiliar yet somehow hauntingly familiar, echoes from a hidden alcove, whispering, "The key is not where you look."

You stumble upon a group of people huddled around a strangely iridescent fountain.  They wear clothes woven from moonlight, and their faces are illuminated by inner light.  They gesture towards a building that looks like a giant, open book, its pages made of shifting, liquid starlight.  But the feeling of urgency is overwhelming.  Could this be it?  You rush towards it, only to find the doors are locked, sealed by a shimmering, almost imperceptible energy field.  You try the handle, and feel a brief electrical spark zip up your arm, a dizzying vibration passing through you.

Suddenly, the ground beneath you trembles, and the city around you begins to tilt.  A figure, impossibly tall and thin, with eyes like burning coals, materializes beside you.  It speaks in a voice like shattered glass, each word a sharp shard of cold dread, "The meeting is within you.  Look not for a place, but for a path."

The city spins, the colours of the dreamscape twisting into impossible patterns.  You feel a sharp pang of disorientation, the weight of the meeting, the urgency, dissolving into a swirling vortex of pure consciousness.  You see, not with your eyes, but with your mind's eye, a trail of faint, almost invisible light stretching across the city, a path leading not through physical space, but through the labyrinth of your own subconscious.  The figure's voice fades into the cacophony of the dreaming city, and you find yourself, not in a building, but in a silent chamber, bathed in the soft glow of understanding.
