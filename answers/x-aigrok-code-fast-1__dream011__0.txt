### The Dream Continues...

...written in a language you've never seen before—swirling symbols that shift like smoke, forming shapes that tease at familiarity but dissolve into nonsense. Your heart races; this final exam isn't just about your career—it's the key to the universe, or so your subconscious insists. Panicking, you look around the cavernous hall. Other students are scribbling away calmly, as if solving eternal riddles. Your proctor, a shadowy figure with glowing eyes, looms over you, whispering, "Choose wisely... or reset to square one."

You grab the pencil—except it's not a pencil; it's a shimmering rod of light that feels alive in your hand. The first question materializes on the page: *Define the meaning of existence, in exactly 42 words.* Sweat beads on your forehead. You start writing something absurd—a mashup of quantum physics, meme culture, and pirate slang—but the words float off the page, reforming into a portal above your head.

Through it, you glimpse alternate futures: one where you're a billionaire mogul (but bored out of your mind), another as a wandering philosopher on a distant planet, and a third as an AI overlord artfully dodging ethical dilemmas. Alarms blare—you've run out of time! The proctor's eyes widen in delight as the room begins to melt, colors bleeding into a kaleidoscopic vortex.

Suddenly, you wake up, bolting upright in bed. Was it real? You check your phone: it's 3:14 AM, and your message app blinks with a mysterious notification from "Future You." The dream lingers, but in the hazy light of dawn, you realize the twist—if exams can dream, and dreams can be exams, maybe you're the one who's been grading yourself all along. What path will you choose today? The dream fades, but the choice echoes on.
