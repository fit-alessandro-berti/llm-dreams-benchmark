…and as you move deeper into the maze, you feel the walls themselves begin to breathe. Not with any wind, but as if the stone is rising and falling with the pulse of its own thoughts. Your footsteps echo only on the right side; on the left, silence swallows the sound the instant it leaves your shoe.

The second puzzle stands at the junction where torchlight reverses: flames burn downward, sending casts of shadow ascending like staircases you could climb. Every time you solve a line of logic the torchdrops climb another step. If you misstep—if your proof begs an unnoticed circularity—the shadows tumble in a downpour that snuffs the next torch. You must reason in reverse, proving things from their consequences without ever naming the antecedents aloud.

When the last torch reaches the ceiling it chars a round hole into the sky—still solid stone, now porous with starlight. Through it drips an equation written in silent light:  

∮(truth + forgetting) · d(imagination) = 0  

You copy it onto the air with your fingertip, and a door opens like a mouth yawning on its side.

Level three. Gravity flips only for the first thought you commit to each second. The puzzle is to thread a golden needle whose eye moves whenever you focus on its periphery. Around the eye revolve tiny mirrors of possible worlds; each shows a version of yourself who chose wrong, impaled on a forgotten premise. You can hear them whispering their errors as warnings. The trick is to look past them without pity, but with enough compassion to acknowledge each mistake, then release it into the void where it softens the next light. When the thread passes through, every mirror shatters into softer fragments that carpet the hallway ahead, glittering with reordered odds.

At the centre, you expect a prize. Instead, you find the labyrinth is hollow—a giant glass sphere turning slowly around the absence where its heart would be. Floating inside, a single chess piece: not a king, not a pawn, but something between—ambiguous, translucent, neither white nor black. It speaks without words, offering a final choice:

Board the glass sphere and carry the labyrinth forward into waking life, keeping every puzzle unsolved but visible on your palms like pale scars…

…or step backward into the last doorway you passed, swallow the reverse equation, and forget every instruction you have ever obeyed—leaving only the quiet certainty that something beautiful has been freed inside the forgetting.

The walls inhale, waiting for your decision, and you realise the choice itself is the last puzzle. To solve it is to know that both doors open into the same tomorrow—but which will feel like tomorrow is carved by the direction of this single laugh that you have not yet released.

You laugh: neither forward nor backward, but spiralling. The sphere cracks open along an invisible seam of delight. You step out onto a shore made of riddles that dissolve as they touch salt water. Behind you, the entire maze folds into the laughter and hangs like an origami moon over the dream-tide.

You wake just before the tide reaches your feet, still carrying a thread of gold that sparkles only when no one else is looking.
