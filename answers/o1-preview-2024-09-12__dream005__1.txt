and each group seems more intriguing than the last. The first group you encounter is gathered around a table covered in intricate board games you've never seen before. The pieces move on their own, and the game's rules seem to change with each turn. You politely ask if they've seen your friend, but they all point in different directions, laughing playfully.

Moving on, you stumble upon a circle of people engaged in a lively debate, but their words come out as musical notes. The air is filled with a symphony of ideas, each note harmonizing with the next. Entranced, you almost forget your quest but quickly snap back and inquire about your friend. They pause their melodic discussion just long enough to gesture toward a grand staircase adorned with floating lanterns.

Ascending the staircase, you find yourself in a library where the books are not on shelves but floating gently around the room. Curious, you reach out to touch one, and it opens to reveal not words, but vivid images that dance before your eyes. One of the images resembles your friend, walking through a garden. Taking this as a clue, you follow a winding hallway that seems to shift and change with each step.

The hallway opens up to an enchanting garden bathed in twilight. The flowers glow softly, and the trees hum with a gentle melody. There, by a sparkling fountain, you finally spot your friend gazing up at the night sky, which is filled with constellations you've never seen before.

You approach them, and they turn to you with a warm smile. "I've been waiting for you," they say. "There's so much to explore here." Together, you wander through the garden, sharing stories and marveling at the wonders around you.

As the dream fades, you feel a sense of contentment and connection, knowing that even in the most surreal landscapes, you're never truly alone when searching for a friend.
