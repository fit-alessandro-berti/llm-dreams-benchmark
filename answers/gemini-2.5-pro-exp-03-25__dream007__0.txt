Okay, here we go... deeper into the dream...

You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you – the colour of the sky in a shared childhood memory, perhaps, or the correct way to fold time. The air crackles with unspoken hurts and frustration. Your friend's face keeps subtly shifting, sometimes looking older, sometimes like a stranger you passed on the street yesterday. The background flickers – one moment you're in a familiar living room, the next you're standing knee-deep in lukewarm raspberry jelly under a purple sun.

You decide to **prove your point using only interpretive dance.**

Suddenly, the anger drains away, replaced by an intense focus. The raspberry jelly (or is it carpet now?) becomes your stage. You leap, not with athletic grace, but with the jerky, unpredictable movements of a faulty automaton. Your arms windmill, trying to convey the precise shade of azure you *know* that sky was. You stomp your foot, representing the unwavering certainty of your belief. You try a pirouette that somehow involves flapping your elbows like a startled goose – this, you feel, perfectly encapsulates the flawed logic of your friend's argument about folding time *backwards*.

Your friend watches, their expression unreadable. Their face settles, for a moment, into the familiar lines you know so well. Then, instead of arguing back with words, they begin to whistle. Not a tune, but a series of sharp, discordant notes that somehow rearrange the furniture in the room (which is definitely a room again, panelled in dark, mismatched wood). A lampshade floats gently onto your head like a hat.

You incorporate the lampshade into your dance, using it to signify the ' C R O W N O F T R U T H '. Your movements become more frantic. You *must* make them understand the crucial difference between cerulean and sapphire! You drop to the floor, writhing, attempting to embody the catastrophic paradoxes inherent in their time-folding method.

Your friend stops whistling. They calmly reach down and offer you a single, perfect, green grape.

You stare at the grape. The lampshade feels heavy. The argument seems suddenly... distant. The grape pulses faintly with light. You look up at your friend, whose eyes now seem to contain tiny, swirling galaxies.

You forget what you were dancing about. You take the grape. It tastes like static electricity and forgotten birthdays. The argument is over, replaced by a profound and slightly unsettling sense of shared absurdity. The purple sun outside the window winks.
