As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and conversations that seem to be flowing effortlessly around you. Each group is vibrant with laughter, stories, and shared moments. You feel a bit out of place, but also curious. You overhear snippets of conversation: 

- "Remember when we all tried to build that fort in the backyard? That was the best summer ever!"
- "Have you seen the new exhibit at the museum? It's incredible!"
- "Did you hear about the surprise party for Sarah? She had no idea!"

You notice a few familiar faces—people you recognize from work or school—but they seem engrossed in their own circles, not looking for someone like you. You begin to wonder if maybe you’re the one who’s missing, or if you’re simply not the kind of person who blends in easily.

Suddenly, you spot them across the room, standing by the edge of a large window. They’re talking quietly, but you can see the warmth in their smile as they listen to whoever is speaking. Without thinking, you make your way over, feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness.

As you approach, they look up and smile warmly. "Hey," they say, "I was just thinking about you."

You exhale, relieved and happy. "Me too," you reply, and the two of you fall into easy conversation. The rest of the crowd fades into the background, and for a moment, everything feels perfect.
