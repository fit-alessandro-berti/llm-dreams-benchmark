Ooh, this feels so real right now, my friend. I feel like I've been punched in the gut because of this looming deadline. My boss just put it in front of me like it's a recipe book! She said it could be postponed with some extra support or even reassignment to another department... I guess that means I'm stuck here for an eternity. And my team is all groaning and nodding, like real estate agents selling their houses - "Aw, crap!" They seem to be saying all at once. What am I doing here if this deadline isn't mine?
