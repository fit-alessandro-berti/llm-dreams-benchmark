...and you begin to **float**.

Not dramatically, just a gentle lift, about six inches off the stage floor. The words you'd planned to say evaporate from your mind, replaced by a mild surprise. The audience, however, doesn't seem to notice your levitation. They're still looking at you expectantly.

You clear your throat, which now seems to echo with the sound of distant wind chimes. You try to say, "Ladies and gentlemen..." but what comes out is a series of perfectly pitched, melodious bird calls. A robin, a sparrow, then a surprisingly complex warbler's song.

You look down at your hands. They're not hands anymore, but intricately woven nests, cradling tiny, glowing eggs. Panic tries to flutter in, but it's more like a curious butterfly than a frantic bird.

The audience leans forward, captivated. One woman in the front row, who you vaguely recognize as your third-grade teacher, pulls out a pair of binoculars. A man beside her starts taking notes on a giant slice of toast using a carrot as a pen.

Suddenly, the ceiling of the auditorium cracks open, not with a crash, but like a giant eggshell, revealing a sky filled with swirling nebulae and planets made of candy. The glowing eggs in your nest-hands begin to hatch, and tiny, feathered philosophers emerge, each chirping profound (though untranslatable) truths.

You realize you're not giving a speech anymore. You're conducting an orchestra of the cosmos, using bird song and nascent wisdom. And somehow, it feels perfectly natural. You raise your nest-hands, and the candy planets begin to spin faster, humming a sweet, cosmic lullaby. The audience sighs, a collective breath of pure, dreamy contentment.
