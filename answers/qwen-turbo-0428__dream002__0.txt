You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and a chill runs down your spine. The sky, once a soft blue, darkens into a swirling mass of violet and gray. The trees begin to sway violently, their branches clawing at the air as if trying to grasp something unseen. A low rumble echoes through the valley, and then, without warning, the first drops of rain fall—cold, sharp, and strange, like liquid silver.

As the storm intensifies, the forest seems to come alive. The leaves shimmer with an otherworldly glow, and the wind whispers in a language you almost understand. You run, but the path ahead shifts, twisting and turning as if the forest itself is guiding you somewhere. Shadows stretch and twist, forming shapes that flicker in and out of existence.

Then, in the heart of the storm, you see it: a glowing archway made of light and mist, standing alone in the middle of the clearing. It pulses gently, as if breathing. You feel drawn to it, compelled by a force deeper than fear. As you step closer, the storm around you begins to calm, the wind stilling, the rain stopping mid-air.

You reach out, and the archway opens—not with a sound, but with a feeling. A door to something unknown, something beyond the limits of your waking mind. And as you cross the threshold, the world behind you fades away, and you are no longer just walking through a forest. You are entering a dream within a dream.
