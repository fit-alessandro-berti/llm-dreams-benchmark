 strike up conversations with them. The first group you approach is discussing their favorite books, so you chime in and recommend a few of your own. They seem impressed with your choices and invite you to join their book club.

Next, you come across a table of artists sharing their latest projects. You show them some photos of your own artwork and they are amazed by your talent. They encourage you to showcase your work at their upcoming gallery event.

As you continue to mingle with different groups, you start to feel more comfortable and confident in this unfamiliar setting. You realize that even though you may not know many people here, you are still able to connect with them through shared interests and passions.

Finally, you spot your friend across the room and make your way over to them, feeling grateful for the new connections and experiences you have gained at this social gathering. The dream ends with you laughing and chatting with your friend, feeling a sense of belonging and belonging.
