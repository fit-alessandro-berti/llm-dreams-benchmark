…you pause, toes sinking into the softened loam, and look up as the sky darkens in an instant. The sun’s gentle rays are swallowed by a rolling blanket of clouds, bruised purple and slate gray. A distant rumble vibrates through the air—half thunder, half the forest itself groaning with expectation.

A sharp breeze whistles between the trunks, bending ferns and stirring a million tiny droplets of moisture. Each leaf seems to quiver as if whispering secrets in a language you almost understand. Cool mist drifts in on the wind, brushing your cheeks like a ghostly hand. Ahead, a fallen log—mottled with emerald moss—becomes slick and shining. You step onto it, heart pumping, toes gripping the living wood.

Suddenly the storm erupts. Sheets of rain lash through the canopy, turning the forest floor into a tapestry of pulsing reflections. Thunder booms so close you feel it in your chest. Yet in the roar you hear something else: a faint, insistent melody, like a lullaby played on a wooden flute. Intrigued, you follow the sound—each footstep stirring water droplets that sparkle in the dim light.

Through a tangle of ancient oaks you discover a hidden glade. At its center, a pool as still as glass mirrors the tempest above. Around the pool’s rim grow luminescent flowers, petals glowing soft gold against the shadowed woodland. The flute’s song grows clearer: warm, welcoming, urging you forward. Kneeling at the edge, you lean in to see your reflection—and in that mirror-surface, your eyes meet those of someone else: a silent guide with a knowing smile.

You reach out, fingertips brushing the water’s surface. The rain’s patter fades, the thunder recedes, and all at once the world holds its breath. Ripples expand, carrying you inward until the edges of the glade blur and dissolve into prismatic light. Enveloped in that glow, you feel a profound calm. Whatever fear the storm brought is washed away, replaced by a boundless sense of possibility.

Then, as quickly as it began, the vision dims. You awaken back on the forest path, raindrops still falling—but now gentle, like a blessing on your shoulders. The melody lingers, a promise that every storm brings its own magic, if only you dare to step into the heart of it.
