…frantically search your pockets, hoping to find a clue about where the meeting might be. Your fingers brush against a crumpled piece of paper in your jacket. Pulling it out, you see faint handwriting that says, "13th Floor, Obsidian Tower." The name triggers a vague sense of familiarity, though you can't recall ever hearing of it before.

Looking around, the city feels alive, almost sentient—neon signs blink at irregular intervals, and the streets seem to shift subtly the moment you take your eyes off them. You approach a stranger, a tall figure with a face obscured by the brim of a wide, shadowy hat. "Do you know where the Obsidian Tower is?" you ask nervously.

The figure tilts their head but says nothing. Instead, they raise an arm and point toward the horizon. You follow their gesture to see a dark, shimmering spire piercing through the chaotic skyline. It glows faintly with an otherworldly light, distant yet magnetic, as though it’s calling to you.

Grateful and unnerved, you thank the stranger, but when you glance back, they’ve disappeared into the crowd.

As you move toward the spire, the streets seem to rearrange themselves to block your path. A staircase that should have led up suddenly loops downward, and an alleyway you just passed now twists into an endless corridor. The harder you concentrate on reaching the tower, the more convoluted the city becomes. You pause to catch your breath, and a small animal—a fox with fur that glitters like starlight—appears at your side. Without hesitation, it takes off running and glances back at you as if urging you to follow.

You chase the fox through narrow alleyways and over bridges that seem suspended in air, trusting it instinctively. After what feels like hours but must only be minutes, you arrive at the base of the Obsidian Tower. The building pulses faintly, its surface as smooth as glass yet rippling like water. A woman, robed in iridescent fabric, stands at the entrance. She’s holding something—a pocket watch—and flips it open as you approach. 

"You’re late," she says, though the watch’s hands are spinning wildly, defying the passage of time. She gives you a cryptic smile. "Are you ready to remember why you're here?"

What do you say?
