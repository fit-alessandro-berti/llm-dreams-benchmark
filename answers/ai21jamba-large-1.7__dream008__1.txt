realize that you're completely unprepared. The task is something entirely outside your expertise, and panic sets in as you try to figure out how to even begin. Your boss is hovering nearby, asking for updates, their impatience growing with every passing second.

Just as you're about to confess that you're in over your head, a colleague—someone you've never seen before—walks in and hands you a mysterious file. It’s filled with incomprehensible diagrams and handwritten notes in a language you don’t understand. You look at it, confused, and then up at the stranger, who simply smiles and says, “Trust me, this will help.”

You open the file again and suddenly realize it’s written in code. instinctively, you know how to decipher it. Your fingers fly across the keyboard as you translate, and the pieces of the impossible project start to fall into place. The room around you blurs, and the sound of your boss’s demands fades into a dull hum.

Hours pass—or is it just minutes?—and you finish the project with moments to spare. You hand it over to your boss, whose expression shifts from frustration to awe. They shake your hand, praising your ingenuity. Just as you begin to bask in the glow of success, the workspace around you morphs into a massive, cheering auditorium. You’re standing on a stage, and the audience is applauding wildly.

Then, you wake up.
