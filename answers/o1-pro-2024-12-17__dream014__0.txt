…tentatively accept their offer, unsure if you can trust them, yet too weary to continue wandering on your own. They guide you through the winding streets as neon lights flicker overhead and distant horns create a rhythm you’ve never heard before. The strangers seem ordinary at first—an elderly woman with kind eyes and a patched shawl, a young man with ink-stained fingers, and a pair of twins dressed in mismatched scarves—but as you move deeper into the maze of tall buildings and hidden alleyways, you notice small, impossible details. The twins’ scarves never stop fluttering, even when there’s no wind. The young man’s ink-stained fingers leave behind faint glowing patterns on the walls when he brushes against them. And the elderly woman hums a tune you swear you know, though you cannot name it.

They lead you beneath a railway arch where puddles reflect bending pillars of light. In the distance, a faint melody drifts towards you—flutes and bells playing just beyond your understanding. You sense that this place is different from the other streets. The pavement seems softer underfoot, and the air tastes like sugared fruit. Someone—or something—is watching from the darkened balconies. Yet, you feel no fear; the presence is gentle, curious.

As the strangers guide you further, they whisper directions and bits of advice: “Always follow where the quietest voice leads,” says the young man, tracing a shimmering arrow onto a brick wall. “Remember to leave a kindness behind you,” adds one of the twins. The other finishes, “So that the city itself will remember you well.” The elderly woman simply presses a small object into your hand—a tiny lantern carved from what looks like bone or ivory. Its wick glows without flame, radiating a soft warmth that calms your racing heart.

Soon you stand before an old wooden door set into the side of an ornate building draped in ivy. It doesn’t seem to belong to the modern skyscrapers around it, as if it is a relic from some older layer of the city’s history. The strangers step back, letting you approach on your own. You turn to ask them if this is truly the way out, but their faces are kind and patient, giving nothing away. A whisper of their voices floats in your ears—“Trust yourself… you’re almost there…”

You reach out to open the door. The knob is cool under your palm, and as the wood creaks open, you step inside, the lantern’s glow illuminating a long hallway lined with mirrors. Each mirror shows you something different—a childhood memory, a hidden fear, a long-held dream you’d nearly forgotten. The hallway stretches farther than it should, and yet, the light in your hand guides you steadily forward.

At last you come to another door at the end of the corridor. Its surface is marked with your own initials, though you have no memory of carving them. When you push it open, you find yourself standing in a quiet courtyard under a star-scattered sky. The bustling city is gone. The strangers are gone. But you feel more grounded, more certain. At your feet, a single note is left behind, scrawled in ink that still glows faintly: “You have found your way.”

You look up, and the dream dissolves into soft light. You awaken with the comforting sense that somewhere, in that strange city of your dreams, you are not alone—and that the path ahead, though winding, is yours to walk.
