You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss, Mr. Henderson, is waiting for you to start, and… and he’s *wearing a full suit of armor*. Not a historical recreation, but a gleaming, slightly dented, medieval suit. It’s reflecting the fluorescent lights in a dizzying pattern.

He clears his throat, the sound echoing strangely within the helmet. “Right, Davies. Project Nightingale. Complete market analysis, competitor breakdown, three fully-fleshed campaign proposals, and a projected ROI report. Due… by lunchtime.” He glances at a grandfather clock that *wasn’t there a moment ago* and chimes a ridiculously loud twelve times.

My jaw drops. “Lunchtime? Mr. Henderson, that’s… that’s physically impossible! This project usually takes weeks!”

He adjusts something within the helmet, and a robotic voice emanates. “Impossible is merely a challenge, Davies. A challenge to be *conquered*. Think of it as… a quest!” He dramatically gestures with a gauntleted hand.

Around me, the office is subtly changing. Filing cabinets are sprouting vines, staplers are chirping like birds, and Brenda from accounting is now meticulously polishing a miniature catapult. Everyone is acting…normal. Like a knight in armor demanding a marketing report is the most natural thing in the world.

I look down at my computer screen. It’s not displaying spreadsheets or data, but a scrolling text adventure game. The first line reads: “You are in a dimly lit office. A knight demands a report. What do you do? 1. Attempt to reason with the knight. 2. Accept the quest. 3. Search the office for clues.”

A wave of surreal calm washes over me. This is a dream. A gloriously, ridiculously, impossible dream. 

I type “3” into the command line. 

The screen flashes. “You search the office. You find a half-eaten bag of gummy bears, a rubber chicken, and a note that reads: ‘The answer lies within the spreadsheets… and the power of interpretive dance.’"

Interpretive dance? 

Mr. Henderson, still in full armor, is now tapping his foot impatiently. The robotic voice booms, “Davies! Progress! The kingdom awaits!”

I take a deep breath, grab the rubber chicken, and decide to embrace the absurdity. This isn't a project. It's a performance. And I'm going to give them the best darn interpretive dance/marketing report the kingdom has ever seen.
