…panic a little, until you notice everyone around you is moving with a strange, slow-motion grace, as if the entire city is underwater. You push through the crowd, trying to ask for directions, but every person you stop simply smiles at you with the exact same expression—soft, knowing, almost amused—and then points in a different direction each time.

Frustrated, you duck into a narrow alleyway, hoping for a shortcut, but the alley stretches on impossibly far. The walls rise higher and higher until they blot out the sky. You break into a jog. Then a run. Your footsteps echo like they belong to someone else.

At last you burst out into a wide plaza. In the center stands a towering statue of… you. Not quite you—an idealized, exaggerated version, carved in marble, holding a map that constantly rearranges itself like a flock of birds.

When you step closer, the statue bends down, the stone groaning gently, and whispers in your own voice:

**“You’re not late. The meeting is waiting for you to find it.”**

Then the statue’s map dissolves into a swirl of luminous smoke that wraps around you, lifting you off the ground. The city below rearranges itself like gears turning in a clock, buildings sliding into new places until they form a perfect, glowing path.

You float forward, carried by the smoke, toward a single open door at the end of the path—bright light pouring out of it like sunrise.

Just as you reach out to cross the threshold…
