This is an intriguing and suspenseful scenario! Since dreams often play out bizarrely while still feeling vivid, I'll try to continue weaving in interesting elements based on the details provided so far.

Continuing the dream:

As you begin taking the final exam, your mind races. The questions appear not on a standard sheet of paper, but instead projected onto a large video screen that fills one wall of the testing room. In bright, futuristic fonts, they read: 

"Section 1: Advanced Quantum Mechanics"

You gasp - quantum mechanics is one of the toughest science courses offered! You've spent countless hours poring over textbooks and doing practice problems. But here you are, bracing yourself for what's to come.

The screen pauses for a moment as your eyes take in the daunting title. Your hands tremble slightly as you reach for a calculator on an adjacent desk. The projector whirs into life again: 

"Prove that the wavefunction of a free particle remains unchanged under Galilean transformation."

Stunned, you squint at the question mark before it fades and is replaced by another:

"Determine the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for a harmonic oscillator potential given initial boundary conditions..."

You exhale in a shaky sigh. Panic begins to creep in as your brain frantically searches memory banks for equations and concepts - complex quantum mechanics you've barely scratched the surface on.

The clock ticks silently, marking each passing minute. Sweat beads on your brow but you bite your tongue against panicking further. 

Section Two: Advanced Astronomy

A quick glance around shows other students anxiously writing furiously at their own desks. Someone is muttering about not studying enough while another checks their watch relentlessly, eyes glassy with fatigue and anxiety.

Questions appear one after the other - each test of knowledge you once believed you possessed has now become a gauntlet to overcome. You're acutely aware that this exam determines your entire career path...your financial future perhaps...

As questions continue appearing at an accelerating rate...the dream feels as if it might never end, but we must wrap up soon for formatting constraints.

In the final minutes before time runs out...
you suddenly recall a crucial theorem learned only recently in lecture:
"..."
"...proof complete!"
The last question vanishes from the screen with a soft whoosh.
You breathe deep of sterile air; relief floods through you like sunshine. 
Your dream has ended... but perhaps there will be another day when dreams provide further challenges?
