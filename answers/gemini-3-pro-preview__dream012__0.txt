...reach for the wheel, but as your hands close around it, the wood turns soft and warm, pulsing like a giant heart. You realize the ship isn't sailing on water anymore; the ocean has turned into a vast, rolling landscape of dark blue velvet, rippling in a wind that smells like cinnamon and ozone.

You open your mouth to shout an order, but instead of words, a beam of golden light spills from your lips. It strikes the mainmast, which instantly bursts into bloom, sprouting thousands of cherry blossoms that glow in the dark.

The crew stops panicking. Their faces smooth over, becoming blank and featureless like mannequins. They begin to float upward, untethered by gravity, drifting toward the storm clouds which are now forming the shape of a giant, sleeping eye.

"It's not a storm," you whisper, realizing the truth suddenly. "It's a blink."

You spin the heart-wheel hard to the left. The velvet ocean unzips, revealing a starry void underneath. The ship dives down, not sinking, but falling into a quiet, endless sky. As you fall, you realize you are no longer the captain, but the ship itself, and the stars are rushing into you to fill your sails.
