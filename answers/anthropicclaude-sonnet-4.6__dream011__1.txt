You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are...

...written in a language you've never seen before. The letters shift and curl like living things, rearranging themselves every time you blink. You look around the exam hall - a vast, cathedral-like room with ceilings that disappear into fog - and notice that everyone else is writing furiously, their pens scratching with impossible confidence.

Your pencil feels heavy. Impossibly heavy. Like it's made of lead in the truest, most literal sense.

You flip to the second page and the questions have changed entirely. Now they're images. A photograph of your childhood bedroom. A map of a city you've never visited but somehow recognize. A drawing of a door.

*What does the door mean to you?* the instructions seem to say, though you didn't read those words so much as *feel* them.

You begin to write. Or you try. But your handwriting keeps becoming someone else's - your mother's cursive, then your third-grade teacher's print, then something ancient and angular.

The proctor walks past. You look up to ask for help and realize the proctor is you. An older you, calm and unhurried, with kind eyes that say *you already know the answers.*

The clock on the wall runs backward.

And somehow, *beautifully*, inexplicably...

you're not afraid anymore.
