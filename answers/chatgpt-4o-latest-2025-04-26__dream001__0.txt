You start to walk quickly through the wide, glimmering streets, the city humming all around you like a living thing. Towering buildings loom overhead, their windows reflecting strange constellations in a sky that shifts color with every step you take. You clutch a piece of paper in your hand — it’s crumpled, the ink smudged, but you can just make out part of an address: **“Room 47, Meridian Tower.”**

People rush past you, some in flowing robes, others in sleek suits, none seeming to notice you. You try asking directions, but their answers come out as riddles or half-remembered songs. A streetcar glides by on rails that spark with violet light, and instinctively, you hop on.

The city morphs around you as the streetcar winds through alleyways that seem to fold and stretch. When it stops, you’re at the foot of an impossibly tall building — *Meridian Tower.* The doors shimmer like liquid glass. You step through and find yourself in a lobby where the walls are covered with clocks, each ticking to a different rhythm.

A woman at the front desk looks up and smiles, though her eyes seem far too ancient for her youthful face. “You’re right on time,” she says, handing you a small, silver key without waiting for you to explain. It’s etched with the number **47**.

You press the elevator button, and as the doors open, a feeling of weightlessness washes over you — like the whole building is lifting into the stars.

Would you like me to keep going? 🌌
