As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak. But no sound comes out. Panic surges as you realize your notes are blank, the pages shimmering and dissolving like smoke. The audience murmurs, their faces blurring into indistinct shapes. You clutch the podium, breath shallow—until suddenly, a warm light envelops you.  

Your throat unlocks. Words flow, not from memory, but from somewhere deeper. The crowd stills. Their features sharpen now, and you recognize faces: old friends, mentors, even your younger self, sitting in the front row. Each nod of encouragement stitches your confidence back together.  

The speech transforms. You’re no longer reciting—you’re sharing truths you didn’t know you carried. The microphone hums with a resonance that feels like fate. When you finish, the applause is thunderous, but it’s the silence of your own calm that wakes you. For a moment, lingering between dream and dawn, you carry the certainty: *You’ve always had the words. You just needed to forget the script to find them.*
