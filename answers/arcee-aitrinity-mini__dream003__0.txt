You are dreaming. Can you complete the following dream?

You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and

**My completed dream:**

...intricate patterns woven across its dark, polished surface. They aren't painted; they seem to be carved or inlaid with a material that shimmers faintly, like liquid moonlight trapped in obsidian. The symbols are complex and unfamiliar – not letters, not runes, but geometric forms that twist and turn with impossible precision, forming spirals that bloom like cosmic flowers and interlocking triangles that seem to pulse with a soft, inner light. They cover every inch, including the lid, which seems to be the thickest part.

A faint hum resonates from deep within the box, barely audible over the sound of your own breathing. Your fingers trail over the cool, smooth obsidian-like surface, drawn inexorably towards the most complex section – a central starburst formation framed by what look like dormant serpents coiled around its points. As your touch lingers there, the humming deepens, becoming a low, vibrating thrum that travels up your arm.

Suddenly, one of the serpentine symbols shifts. It doesn't move violently, but rather *unfurls* slightly, revealing a faint, barely perceptible indentation at its base – a keyhole, hidden within the pattern itself. It wasn't invisible, but designed to be seen only by those who truly *looked* and felt the box's resonance.

A wave of understanding washes over you. These weren't just decorations; they *were* the lock. The key wasn't separate; it was part of the pattern, a specific sequence of pressure or touch required to release the lid. The hum confirmed it – the box *wanted* you to interact.

Your heart races. How to proceed? Should you press firmly on the starburst? Trace the serpents' paths? You close your eyes, focusing on the subtle vibrations, the faint light emanating from the patterns. A sense of ancient wisdom or dormant power settles over you. This isn't just a box; it's a guardian of secrets. The right action isn't force, but understanding. Patience and reverence are required. You wait for the next shift...
