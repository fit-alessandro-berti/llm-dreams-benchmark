You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, you feel the air grow colder, the walls shifting subtly as if the maze is alive. The glow of your handheld light flickers, casting elongated shadows that dance across the stone floor. Behind you, the path you came from vanishes, leaving only the labyrinth ahead.  

The first puzzle appears on a pedestal made of obsidian, its surface etched with symbols that seem to rearrange themselves when you blink. A riddle hums in the air: *"I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?"* You realize the symbols are a cipher—each answer rearranges the glyphs into a pattern. After minutes of decoding, you whisper, *"An echo!"* The pedestal cracks open, revealing a key shaped like a serpent. You pocket it, but the walls tremble, and the maze begins to rotate slowly, as if testing your resolve.  

Deeper in, the air smells of burnt ozone. A door sealed by a grid of glowing orbs blocks your path. Each orb pulses in rhythm with your heartbeat. A low voice murmurs, *"To pass, you must align the past, present, and future."* You recall the key’s serpent shape and realize the orbs must be timed with the rhythm of your breath. As you inhale, you tap the left orb; on the exhale, the middle; and hold your breath for the right. The grid flashes, and the door opens to a chamber lined with mirrors. Your reflection stares back—but it’s not you. It smiles, and you feel a surge of dread.  

The mirrors fragment, revealing a staircase spiraling into darkness. At the bottom, a final puzzle awaits: a floating sphere of light, surrounded by equations that spiral outward. The voice returns, this time clearer: *"Solve the paradox, or be consumed by the maze."* You realize the equations are fractals—each answer reveals a new layer. As you solve them, the maze’s walls dissolve, revealing a starry void. The sphere’s light converges into a single point, and you feel yourself being pulled toward it.  

When you open your eyes, you’re back in your room, the light from your phone flickering. But on your wrist, a faint scar in the shape of a serpent glows faintly. The maze lingers in your mind, its puzzles whispering secrets you can’t yet understand.
