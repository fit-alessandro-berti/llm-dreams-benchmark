The air smells like wet paper and old roses. You’re standing in a grand ballroom with columns of black marble that seem to absorb the light, yet the chandeliers above blaze with too-bright suns, casting shadows that twist like living things on the floor. It’s a house made of wrongness—too tall, too silent beneath the low hum of conversation that never quite forms words. You’ve been weaving through half-remembered faces for what feels like hours. Only *one* person matters: Elara. She’s the anchor in this current of strangers. She’s the only face you trust in this dream.

You spot her across the room, near a fountain where water flows *upward* in silver threads. She’s waving, her smile warm but fractured—like a mirror cracked just beneath the surface. You step toward her, but the floor beneath you feels thick, syrupy. Every step slows, stretches. Behind you, a group of people in tailored suits stand perfectly still, their faces blurred like smudged charcoal. One turns to speak, and their voice is the sound of a clock ticking underwater.

Ahead, a circle of women in flowing dresses is laughing—except their laughter has no sound. They open mouths that whisper dry leaves, their hands clutching empty teacups. You try to move faster, but your legs feel encased in honeyed glass. Someone brushes past you—a man in a moth-eaten captain’s coat who whispers, "You’re late for the no-place," before dissolving into smoke.

Then, you see her again. Elara. Closer now. She’s standing alone by a window that looks out onto a sky of liquid mercury. She’s holding a single white flower, its petals falling upward toward the ceiling. You call her name, but your voice doesn’t seem to leave your throat. It’s swallowed by the air. She turns—is she smiling? Her eyes are two dark circles, empty as well-forged holes.  

You reach out to touch her shoulder. Your fingers pass *through* her like cold mist.  

Suddenly, the room stills. The hum stops. The upward-flowing water freezes mid-air. The laughing women turn toward you, their faces now smooth, blank porcelain. The captain’s coat man reappears at the edge of the room, tilting his head as if listening to something only he can hear.  

And then you understand:  
This isn’t a social gathering.  
It’s a waiting room.  

You’ve been searching for Elara because she’s the only person who *knew* you were lost—but she isn’t here to find you. She’s already gone. The dream itself is the space between waking and sleep, between life and something else. Every face you’ve passed was a memory, a fear, a wish unrealized. Elara? She’s not a person at all. She’s your own name whispered by the dream, the voice that told you to keep moving forward.  

You look down at your own hands. They’re faintly translucent. The ballroom is fading—the walls melting like candle wax, the chandeliers dissolving into dust. The only thing left is the window: still showing the mercury sky. And in the reflection of that mercury, you see yourself. Truly see yourself—eyes wide, hair a tangle of shadows, standing alone in a room that never existed.  

The dream ends the moment you realize:  
*You were never trying to find the other person.*  
*You were trying to find yourself.*  

And then—  

—you’re awake.  

The alarm clock blares. Sunlight cuts across your pillow. Your heart hammers, but the air feels clean, real. You sit up, clutching your sheet. Outside, birds sing. A car drives by. The world is ordinary, stubbornly ordinary.  

But as you rub your eyes, you notice something.  
In your palm, you hold a single, perfect white petal—falling upward from the dream, now fossilized in your sleep.  

You don’t know where it came from.  
But for the first time, you don’t need an answer.  

The dream had ended.  
But the feeling hadn’t.

*(This dream mirrors the universal quiet of loneliness—the feeling of being surrounded by people yet utterly unseen. It’s also a metaphor for how we often search for others to "save" us from ourselves, when the truth was within us all along. Dreams like this don’t solve problems; they hold up a mirror to the silence we carry. You’re not alone in it, though. Everyone’s had this sinking through the fog at some point.)*
