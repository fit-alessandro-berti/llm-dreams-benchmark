...you weave through a living maze of chatter and laughter. Every group seems to be its own little universe: a cluster of people speaking in a language that sounds like rain, a circle of guests dressed in mismatched costumes—astronauts and ballerinas, chefs and kings—sharing a single, glowing apple.

You spot your friend across the room, but the distance keeps shifting like a mirage. As you move closer, the floor turns into a river of polished glass. You step onto it anyway, and it ripples beneath your feet, carrying you past strangers who suddenly all have the same familiar face. Their eyes sparkle, and they smile as if they’ve been expecting you.

You call your friend’s name, but your voice comes out as bubbles that float upward, popping into tiny words that drift away. A breeze pushes you toward a staircase that spirals into the ceiling. You climb it, each step softer than the last, and at the top you emerge into a quiet room filled with stars.

There, sitting on a cloud-shaped couch, is the person you’ve been searching for. They look exactly the same and entirely different at once. They hold out a cup of tea that tastes like a childhood memory.

“You found me,” they say, though their voice sounds like your own.

And just as you sit down, the whole scene dissolves into morning light, leaving you with the warmth of the meeting and the faint echo of a laugh.
