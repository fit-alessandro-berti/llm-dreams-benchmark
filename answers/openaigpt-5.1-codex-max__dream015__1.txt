...build instead of merely survive.

There is a cracked highway leading to the ghost of a city. Cars sit bleached white by sun and time, vines throttling their steering wheels. In your backpack are a handful of seeds scavenged from a forgotten basement and a dented tin can that still gleams if you rub it with your sleeve. You sling your pack higher, look at the endless gray, and decide that if all you do is run and hide, the world will stay like this forever.

So you walk toward the tallest skeletal tower. Its glass has long ago become glittering dust in the soil around it. Somewhere near its crown, the wind whistles through hollow steel. You climb, hand over hand, through stairwells that smell of rust and ozone. Dangers are there, scrabbling noises in the dark, the flash of eyes, but you move quickly, quietly, heart pounding like a drum in your chest. At the thirty-third floor, a wolf with too many teeth stares at you from a hallway, and you stare back, and the two of you let each other pass as if you both know there's no energy to waste.

On the roof, the world spreads out like a broken map. The sun is a white coin tossed in a sickly sky. You pry up squares of asphalt with a crowbar you found, revealing earth that has not seen light in years. You pour your canteen slowly, the water darkening the dirt. You press the seeds in with your fingers, and for a moment it's absurd, kneeling on a ruined skyscraper feeding the ground with drops and hope.

Days pass. The weather is not kind. Acid rain hisses on broken glass, night winds scream, strange figures move through the streets below like shadows cut from paper. You build little fences from scrap, cover the seedlings with your coat when it freezes, sing to them songs you barely remember. You meet other drifters—gaunt faces drawn by hunger, eyes hollow as burned-out windows. They pause when they see you on your rooftop garden, then they climb. One brings a cracked mirror that catches light, another brings a battery to power a small lamp, one, a child with matted hair, brings laughter.

The first green shoots break through the soil as if the world itself is taking a breath. They are tender, trembling at the breeze, tiny freckles of life in all that gray. You cup them with your hands, feel their fuzz against your skin. Something loosens in your chest that you did not know was tight. Word spreads. More people come. Someone knows how to rig a rain catcher. Someone else whispers of other seeds, other places. The rooftop becomes a gathering, a sanctuary perched over desolation. Music returns in the tap of a tin cup, the scrape of a spoon on a can. Stories are traded under a canvas strung between rebar.

There are still dangers. There always will be. One night, the too-many-teeth wolf returns and lies at the edge of the garden, tail curled around itself, watching the sprouts with the same curious hunger as the people. In the distance, lightning forks across the horizon, illuminating the skeleton of the world like an x-ray. You stand among your fragile plants, feeling the rain on your face, and realize you're no longer just surviving. You are making a place to live.

In the shifting logic of dreams, the plants grow faster than they should. They climb up your legs, wrap around the broken antennas, bloom neon flowers that hum softly. The dead city begins to breathe, exhaling dust and inhaling the scent of chlorophyll. You look down from your garden and see that streets once empty now have figures moving with purpose, carrying buckets, beams, laughter. The sky cracks, not with thunder but with a faint blue, and as the color spills across the clouds, you feel your own lids flutter.

The rooftop dissolves into your bedroom ceiling. Your hands, still feeling phantom soil, open on your blanket. You wake with the taste of rain on your tongue and an inexplicable resolve lodged in your ribs: even in ruin, you can choose to plant, to build, to tend something fragile into strength. The dream lingers like sunlight on your face.
