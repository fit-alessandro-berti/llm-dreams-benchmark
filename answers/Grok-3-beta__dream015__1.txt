venture out in search of a rumored safe haven, a place called "Eden's Refuge," said to be hidden beyond the Wasteland Mountains. The stories you've heard speak of lush green fields, clean water, and a community that welcomes all who make the perilous journey. With nothing but a tattered map, a half-empty canteen, and a rusted knife, you set off at dawn, the crimson sun casting long shadows over the desolate landscape.

As you trek through the cracked, barren earth, you encounter remnants of the old world—rusted cars half-buried in sand, crumbling buildings with faded signs, and eerie silence broken only by the howl of the wind. Suddenly, you hear a faint rustling behind you. Instinctively, you grip your knife and turn, only to see a small, scruffy dog limping toward you. Its fur is matted, and one of its legs is injured, but its eyes are wide with a mix of fear and hope. You hesitate—resources are scarce, and taking care of another living thing could slow you down—but something in its pleading gaze tugs at your heart. You decide to share a sip of your precious water and a scrap of dried meat from your pack. The dog, grateful, wags its tail weakly and begins to follow you.

Days pass, and the journey grows harder. The Wasteland Mountains loom in the distance, their jagged peaks shrouded in mist. You and your newfound companion, whom you've named Scrap, face searing heat by day and bone-chilling cold by night. One evening, as you set up camp in the shadow of a crumbling overpass, you notice flickering lights in the distance. Your heart races—could it be Eden's Refuge, or is it a trap set by raiders? You weigh your options: investigate the lights and risk danger, or stay on your planned route and potentially miss a vital clue.

Choosing to investigate, you creep closer with Scrap by your side, moving silently through the darkness. As you near the source of the light, you see it's not a settlement but a small group of survivors huddled around a fire. Their faces are gaunt, their clothes tattered, but they don’t seem hostile. One of them, an older woman with a weathered face, notices you and raises a hand in a cautious greeting. She introduces herself as Mara and offers you a seat by the fire, along with a small portion of their meager stew. In exchange, she asks for news of the outside world. You share what little you know, and she tells you that Eden's Refuge is real—she’s seen it with her own eyes—but the path is guarded by a ruthless band of scavengers who demand a steep toll for passage through the mountains.

Mara offers you a choice: join their group for safety in numbers as they plan to confront the scavengers, or continue alone with a detailed map of a hidden trail she claims can bypass the toll. You look at Scrap, who nudges your hand as if sensing the weight of the decision, and then at the flickering fire casting shadows on the weary faces around you. The night stretches on, and the dream lingers on the edge of this choice, the uncertainty of your next step echoing the vast, unknown world beyond.
