I'm dreaming...

You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to take a deep breath and truly listen. As you quiet your own defensive thoughts, you notice the room around you shifting subtly—the walls seem to breathe, and the distance between you and your friend keeps changing without either of you moving.

"I just need you to understand," your friend says, but their voice echoes strangely, as if coming from multiple directions at once. You reach out to touch their shoulder, but your hand passes through them like smoke.

Suddenly, you're both standing in a vast library you've never seen before. Towering bookshelves stretch upward into darkness, and each book spine bears the title of a memory you share with this person. Your argument continues, but now when either of you speaks, the words materialize as glowing text that hovers in the air between you.

"Maybe we're both right," you suggest, and the floating words transform into a bridge connecting the space between you. As you step onto it, the library dissolves, and you find yourselves in a garden where the plants respond to your emotions—thorns growing when anger flares, flowers blooming with each moment of understanding.

Your friend's face keeps shifting between how they look now and how they looked when you first met years ago. You realize that what you're arguing about isn't really the point—it's about the fear of losing something precious in your connection.

"What if we..." you begin, but wake before finishing the thought, the dream garden fading as consciousness returns.
