...feel a wave of panic wash over you. The clock on the wall ticks louder and louder, each second echoing in your ears like a gong. Your desk is cluttered with papers, sticky notes, and empty coffee cups, but somehow, you can’t find the pen you need. Your boss is standing over you, arms crossed, tapping their foot impatiently. You try to explain that the deadline is unrealistic, but the words get stuck in your throat. No sound comes out.  

Suddenly, the office starts to shift. The walls stretch and warp, the ceiling spiraling upward into an endless void. Your coworkers, who were once bustling around you, have turned into faceless figures, moving in slow motion. You look down at your hands and realize they’re typing furiously on a keyboard, but the screen in front of you is blank.  

Your boss’s voice booms, “You’re running out of time!” but when you turn to look at them, they’ve transformed into a giant hourglass, the sand pouring down faster and faster. You try to stand up, but your chair has become sticky, trapping you in place. The room grows darker, the air thicker.  

Out of nowhere, a door appears in the distance. It’s glowing faintly, like an exit sign. You somehow break free from the chair and start running toward it, but the floor beneath you stretches like taffy, making it impossible to reach. The sand continues to pour, and the hourglass begins to crack.  

Just as the glass shatters, you wake up, gasping for air, your heart racing. The dream lingers for a moment before fading, leaving behind a strange mix of relief and unease.
