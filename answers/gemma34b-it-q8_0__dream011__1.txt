You are standing in a massive library, silent save for the rustle of turning pages. Marble busts watch impassively from the walls – figures of composers, inventors, artists - all judging with stony stillness. You’ve dreamt of this test since the first day of class, ‘The Architecture of Becoming’, and you’re utterly bone-tremblig with nerves. You've dedicated every waking moment to grasping the theories, absorbing the perspectives. This exam. *It* decides everything.

As you settle into the enormous leather armchair before the long desk – polished to a mirror sheen - you notice the questions aren’t typed, or printed in classic script. They aren’t multiple choice. No, the questions, rendered in a shimmering, opaline ink, simply **float within small, clear orbiutns that drift before me.**  Each orb pulsates with a different, subtly shifting aura of color: jade green, burning amber, deep violet. And each, utterly and completely, contains an impossible object.

One orb holds a single, petrified hummingbird heart, perfectly intact. Another vibrates with a miniature thunderstorm, contained inside.  Then there is a solid block of crystallized regret, reflecting miniature portraits – each face a stranger you vaguely know, and one that is undeniably, hauntingly, *you*.  

The final orb - larger than the others - is almost unsettlingly bright. Within it swims a perfectly sculpted miniature version of *you*, but draped entirely in silver scales and leading a procession of iridescent snails. 

Before you can even process the bewildering array, a disembodied voice, smooth like polished marble, whispers – “Reflect on what *feels* most true to you. Don't analyze; *become*.  Choose freely. The answers are held within.”
 
…and a shiver runs through me.  I realize this isn’t about knowledge of theories.  This is about *feeling*. And I haven't prepared myself to *feel*, only to understand.


What do I do?
