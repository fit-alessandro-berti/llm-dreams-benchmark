**Dream Continuation:**

As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak. But suddenly, your voice is gone. Panic rises in your chest as you open your mouth—nothing comes out. The audience leans in, waiting, their expressions shifting from anticipation to confusion.

You try again, but still, no sound. The silence stretches, thick with discomfort. Then, from the back of the room, a child’s voice rings out, clear and bright: *"You don’t need words."*

You turn toward the sound and see the child pointing at your hands. Looking down, you realize they’re glowing faintly, pulsing with energy. The silence doesn’t matter anymore. You raise your hands, and the crowd begins to float—gently, effortlessly—rising toward the ceiling as if carried by an invisible current. Laughter bubbles up, not from fear, but from pure, weightless joy.

When you wake, the last thing you remember is the child’s voice, still echoing in your mind: *"You don’t need words."*
