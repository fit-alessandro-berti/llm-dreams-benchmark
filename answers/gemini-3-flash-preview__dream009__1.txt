The air tastes of crushed thyme and old stone. The sky above is a blue so deep it feels heavy, unpolluted by the haze of engines or the glow of cities. You are standing in a courtyard of white limestone, where the only sound is the rhythmic *hiss-thump* of a wooden loom from a nearby doorway. People pass you in robes of undyed wool, their faces bronzed by a sun that feels closer, more personal.

You look down at your hands. They are calloused, stained with a faint indigo dye. As you explore the winding, dust-blown streets of this silent city, you realize you need to **find the Archive of Echoes before the sun touches the obsidian notch on the horizon.**

In this era, memories aren't stored on chips or in clouds; they are kept in the throats of the mountain swallows that nest in the cliffs above the village. You are the "Weaver of Breath," the only one who knows the specific, intricate whistle required to call the birds down. 

If you fail to reach the high balcony before the transition of the light, the birds will fly north, carrying away the town's collective history. By morning, the mother in the loom-room won't recognize her child, and the elders will forget the paths to the wells. 

You begin to run, your leather sandals slapping against the heat-soaked clay. The modern world—the phones, the passwords, the schedules—is a fading vapor. Here, the only thing that matters is the melody rising in your throat, a song you’ve never heard but somehow know by heart. You reach the base of the Great Tower, your lungs burning with air that feels like liquid gold, and you begin to climb.
