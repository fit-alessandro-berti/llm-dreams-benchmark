You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to weave your way through the labyrinth of streets, hoping to find a familiar landmark. The city is a blend of architectural styles—gleaming skyscrapers intertwined with ancient temples and winding cobblestone alleys. The sky above shifts between day and night, stars twinkling even as the sun glows on the horizon.

People hurry past you, speaking in languages you don't understand. You try asking for directions, but their words are a jumble of sounds, and they gesture vaguely in all directions. Anxiety begins to creep in. You check your watch—time seems to be moving faster than it should.

Turning a corner, you spot a towering clock tower with ornate hands ticking backwards. Below it is a street performer juggling glowing orbs. Desperate, you approach him. "Excuse me, can you help me find my meeting?" you ask.

He smiles mysteriously. "Meetings are destinations of the mind," he replies. He tosses you one of the orbs. Instinctively, you catch it, and it illuminates with images of places you've never seen.

Confused but undeterred, you follow a path that the orb seems to guide you toward. The streets transform around you; buildings rise and fall, streets curve impossibly. You arrive at a bridge made entirely of glass, spanning a river reflecting a sky full of galaxies.

On the other side of the bridge stands a grand hall with doors that reach the clouds. As you approach, the doors swing open silently. Inside, a long table is set with mirrored plates, and seated around it are versions of yourself at different ages, all smiling knowingly.

"We've been waiting for you," they say in unison.

Stunned, you take a seat. The orb in your hand rises into the air, joining a constellation of lights above. Your younger self leans forward. "The meeting isn't about where you are, but who you've become."

A sense of peace washes over you. The urgency fades, replaced by understanding. The walls of the hall begin to dissolve into a swirl of colors, and you feel yourself floating.

You awaken with a start, the remnants of the dream fading like morning mist. But the sense of clarity remains, and you carry it with you as you step into the day ahead.
