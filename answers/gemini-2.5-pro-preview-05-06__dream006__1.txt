...begin to **feel a strange, ticklish sensation in your throat**. You try to clear it, a little cough, but the tickle intensifies, morphing into a vibration. You open your mouth to speak, to say "Good evening, esteemed guests," but instead of words, a **perfect, melodious birdsong trills out**, clear and bright.

You clamp your mouth shut, horrified. The audience, however, leans forward, their expressions not of shock, but of rapt attention, some even closing their eyes as if listening to a beautiful symphony.

You try again, focusing, *willing* the words to come out. "Ladies and gentlemen..." but this time, a **deep, resonant croak, like a giant frog, rumbles from your chest**, shaking the very podium. A few people in the front row actually sway, as if to the rhythm.

Panic begins to set in. You glance down at your notes, desperate for a lifeline, but the words on the page are **wriggling, rearranging themselves into musical staves**. The ink flows like liquid, notes dancing and forming tiny, perfect quavers and crotchets.

You look back up. The expectant faces are still there, but now, some of them have subtle, animalistic features. The woman in the third row has distinctly feathery eyebrows. The man beside her seems to have elongated, twitching ears.

A wave of dizziness washes over you. The stage lights seem to pulse, and the air grows thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles. You realize your hands, gripping the podium, are no longer quite human – your fingers seem longer, more delicate, and tipped with what look suspiciously like... petals?

You take a deep breath, and this time, when you exhale, it's not sound that emerges, but a **shower of shimmering, iridescent pollen** that drifts over the front rows. The audience members inhale deeply, their eyes shining, and a collective sigh of contentment whispers through the hall.

You feel a strange sense of peace. Maybe this speech isn't about words after all. Maybe... maybe this is exactly what they came to hear. You raise your petal-tipped hands, ready to conduct the next part of this bizarre, beautiful symphony.
