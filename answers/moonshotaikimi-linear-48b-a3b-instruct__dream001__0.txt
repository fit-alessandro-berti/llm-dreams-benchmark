You start to panic, your heart racing as you scan the skyline of towering glass and crumbling stone structures, each one unfamiliar. The streets twist in impossible directions, buildings flicker between centuries, and no one you ask knows where the place you're looking for is—or even what it's called.

Then, out of nowhere, a child hands you a half-bitten piece of paper. It's a map, but not quite—it's a sketch of the city as you feel it, not as it *is*. Streets move. Buildings breathe. The meeting place is labeled with a symbol you've never seen before, but somehow you know: *follow the light where the shadows don't quite reach.*

You take a deep breath, clutch the map to your chest, and begin walking—toward a light that pulses like a heartbeat, knowing that if you don't reach it in time, the dream itself might forget who you are.
