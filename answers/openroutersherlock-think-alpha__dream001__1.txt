You start to panic, your heart racing like a trapped bird as you spin in circles, scanning the neon-drenched skyline for any landmark. Towering spires pierce cotton-candy clouds, and the streets pulse with rivers of glowing pedestrians who glide instead of walk. You flag down a cab that's shaped like a giant goldfish, its fins flapping lazily.

"Take me to my meeting!" you shout, sliding into the bowl-shaped seat filled with bubbling water. The driver, a man with eyes like swirling galaxies, chuckles. "Meeting? Ah, yes—the Grand Clocktower of Forgotten Promises. But first, you must solve the riddle of the whispering shadows."

The cab dives into a tunnel of liquid mirrors, reflecting infinite versions of you—some confident in suits, others in pajamas, one juggling flaming pineapples. Whispers echo: *Turn back, or forward forever.* You blurt out, "What has keys but can't open locks?" The driver grins. "A piano!"

The fish-cab erupts from the tunnel onto a floating plaza where clocks melt like Dali paintings, hands spinning backward. There, at a table of levitating teacups, sits your boss—a colossal owl in a pinstripe suit. "You're late," it hoots, but then morphs into your childhood pet goldfish, swimming through the air.

You laugh, the tension dissolving into sparkles, and suddenly you're weightless, soaring over the city as it folds into origami birds. The meeting? Forgotten. The dream whispers, *Wake up, it's only Tuesday...* and you do, with the alarm blaring.
