...pull out a small glass marble from my pocket. As I hold it up between us, it begins to glow softly, and suddenly we can both see our words hanging in the air like colorful smoke - mine in blue, theirs in orange. The angry words are jagged and sharp, while the caring words underneath shimmer like water.

My friend reaches out to touch one of the floating words and it transforms into a paper airplane that flies in circles around us. We both start laughing, even though we can't remember why we were fighting. The room we're in keeps changing - first it's my childhood kitchen, then a library with infinite shelves, then we're standing on a bridge made of piano keys that play notes as we walk.

"I was trying to tell you about the door," my friend says, pointing behind me. I turn and see a door that wasn't there before, painted with both of our names in languages that don't exist yet. We both know, in that dream-logic way, that opening it together is the only thing that matters.

As we each place a hand on the doorknob, I realize we're both wearing the same shoes - one of mine, one of theirs - and this seems like the most natural thing in the world...
