As the competition progresses, you face various challenges that test not just your skills, but your very essence. The first trial is a maze of reflections, where the walls shimmer with fragmented images of your past—your doubts, regrets, and fears. You must navigate through the ever-shifting corridors, each turn revealing a different version of yourself. The maze whispers your insecurities, but you push forward, refusing to be defined by them. When you finally emerge, the air is thick with the scent of ozone, and the walls fade into a shimmering, starlit sky.  

Next, you’re thrown into the *Riddle of the Sky*. A floating platform hovers above a void, and a voice echoes: *“I am born of fire, yet I quench it. I am the breath of life, yet I can break it. What am I?”* You close your eyes, feeling the pulse of the stars beneath you. The answer is *“a flame.”* As you speak it, the platform spirals upward, and the void transforms into a vast, endless ocean. You swim through it, guided by the light of a single lantern tied to your belt—your hope.  

The final challenge arrives in the form of a *Team Trial*. You’re paired with three strangers, each with a distinct trait: a hacker who speaks in riddles, a warrior with a broken arm, and a scientist obsessed with time. Together, you must repair a fractured time machine, its gears rusted and its core pulsing erratically. The machine’s core is a mirror, and as you work, you realize the puzzle is not just technical but emotional. The hacker’s riddles reveal a hidden story of loss; the warrior’s broken arm is a symbol of resilience. You piece the machine together, not with tools, but with empathy.  

When the machine activates, it doesn’t just transport you—it *reflects* you. The mirror shows not your face, but the collective truth of your journey: your courage, your ability to trust, and your unyielding belief in yourself. The machine hums, and the sky erupts in colors you’ve never seen.  

You are the winner. The grand prize is your dream job: a mission to explore the edges of the universe, where no one has gone before. The job is called *Starbound Voyager*, and it requires not just skill, but the heart to face the unknown. As you step into the spacecraft, the mirror in the control room glows, and you realize the true prize was never the job—it was the truth you’d uncovered about yourself.  

In the dream, you soar through the cosmos, not as a contestant, but as a star.
