feel a wave of panic crashing over you. The clock on the wall ticks louder, each second amplifying your anxiety. You look at the stack of documents, the blinking cursor on your computer screen, and the expectant gaze of your boss. Thoughts race through your mind: *How am I supposed to finish this? What if I fail?*  

But then, something shifts. You take a deep breath, and the chaos around you seems to slow down. You realize you’re not alone—your colleagues are here, and they’re ready to help. You start delegating tasks, breaking the project into manageable pieces. The impossible deadline becomes a challenge, not a nightmare.  

As you work, the office transforms. The walls fade away, and you find yourself in a surreal landscape—a forest of floating clocks, each ticking at its own pace. Your boss morphs into a wise old tree, its branches offering guidance. You feel a strange sense of calm, knowing that time is fluid here, and everything will fall into place.  

By the time you wake up, the dream lingers. The impossible deadline feels less daunting, and you carry the dream’s message: even in chaos, there’s a way forward.
