# Dream Sequence

...and you begin to realize you've forgotten what you were supposed to talk about. Your notes—did you even have notes? You pat your pockets, but your hands move through them like water. 

The audience leans forward as one organism, their faces blurring and resharpening. Someone in the front row is your third-grade teacher. No—now she's a stranger. Now she's made of birds that haven't quite figured out how to hold a human shape.

You open your mouth and instead of words, colors pour out—deep purples and electric blues that hang in the air like silk ribbons. The audience nods approvingly. One person begins to applaud, but their hands make the sound of waves crashing.

You realize you're doing brilliantly. 

The stage beneath you has become soft, moss-covered. Or maybe it's always been moss. You're giving the most important speech of your life about something you absolutely understand but could never explain. The words are in a language you don't speak but have always known.

Behind you, the curtain opens onto your childhood backyard. The audience doesn't notice—or they're all suddenly in the backyard too, sitting in rows of seats between the garden and the old fence that's somehow impossibly tall now, stretching up into clouds.

You keep speaking in colors and sounds, and everyone understands perfectly. This is going exactly as planned, according to a plan you never made.
