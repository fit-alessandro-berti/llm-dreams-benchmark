...reach for your phone, but your hand closes around a smooth, cool stone instead. The sense of urgency hits you like a physical blow. You look up, and the street signs are written in glowing, shifting symbols that you can almost read, but not quite.

The buildings around you aren't just tall; they lean in impossible ways, stacked like children's blocks that defy gravity. Their surfaces aren't concrete or brick, but something like polished bone, reflecting the strange, amethyst-colored sky. People drift past, their faces indistinct blurs, murmuring in a language that sounds like wind chimes and distant static. You try to call out, "Excuse me! Can you help me?" but the words come out as a flurry of autumn leaves that scatter uselessly at your feet.

You decide to just pick a direction and run. The ground beneath you isn't solid pavement; it feels like walking on thick velvet that occasionally sinks or shifts like water. As you run, the same archway seems to repeat every few yards, identical, leading into identical, dimly lit alleys. You pass a clock tower, but its face is a swirling vortex of colors, and you can *feel* the time rushing away from you, not ticking.

Panic starts to bubble up. You stop, breathing hard, and the city seems to hold its breath with you. The air smells faintly of cinnamon and rain. You spot what looks like a map stand, rush towards it – but as you get close, it transforms into a tree made of glass, its branches tinkling musically in the silent air.

The meeting! Only minutes left, you can feel it in your bones. You look down at your hands, and they aren't quite your own – they're translucent, shimmering slightly. You lift one to shield your eyes from the strange light, and the buildings seem to ripple like reflections on water. A whisper tickles the edge of your hearing, saying something about "the place where the sideways bridges meet the river of forgotten names." Does that mean anything?

You turn a corner and find yourself on the edge of a vast, empty square. In the center sits a single, ornate chair, illuminated by a spotlight from the impossible sky. There's no one there, but you have a profound, unsettling feeling that *this* is connected. The air feels heavy with expectation. You check the time again, though you have no watch or clock – the hour has shrunk to a single, taut second. The meeting... it feels like it's happening *here*, now, maybe in that empty chair, or maybe you *are* the meeting, waiting to be found. The pressure builds... the purple light intensifies... and the dream holds you, suspended, just before the moment arrives.
