**Dream Completion:**

You sit at your desk, fingers hovering over the keyboard as your boss looms behind you, their shadow stretching impossibly long across the walls. The project brief glows on your screen, but the words keep shifting—*"Design a black hole prototype by 5 PM,"* then *"Translate the sound of thunder into Excel formulas."* Your coffee cup overflows with confetti when you reach for it. 

The clock on the wall accelerates, its hands spinning like helicopter blades. Colleagues murmur in tongues, their faces pixelating at the edges. Panic rises, but then you notice your mouse is made of putty. You mold it into a key, jam it into the USB port, and the monitor dissolves into a waterfall. Data streams flow upward. You dive in, surfing formulas that calcify into a bridge. 

Your boss’s voice booms, *"Progress?"* but it’s too late—the bridge arcs into a rainbow, and you’re sprinting across it, deadlines snapping like twigs beneath your feet. The finish line? A neon sign blinking *"Ctrl+Z."* You slam the key, and the office resets. Your boss hands you a cupcake with a candle counting down from *∞*. You blow, and time unravels into confetti. 

When you wake, the taste of static lingers. Your alarm clock hums, *"You’ve got 8 hours. Again."*
