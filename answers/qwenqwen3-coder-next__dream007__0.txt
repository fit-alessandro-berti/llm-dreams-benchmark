You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you—the future of the community garden you both planted together, now threatened by a developer’s offer to buy the land for luxury condos. Voices rise, words sharp as broken glass, until you see your friend’s eyes flicker—not with anger, but with something older, deeper: exhaustion.  

You decide to **stop speaking**.

Not out of defeat, but by choice. You take a slow breath, unclench your fists, and reach into your pocket—not for a phone or keys, but for a small, smooth river stone you’d picked up weeks ago, when you both sat by the creek, dreaming of tomatoes and sunflowers. You place it gently on the fence between you, its surface cool and unbroken.

Your friend stiffens, caught mid-sentence. Their breath hitches. The wind through the garden rustles the kale, the marigolds, the seedlings you’re still learning to name.

“You built the compost bins,” you say, voice softer now, raw at the edges. “I watered them every dawn. This place… it’s not just dirt. It’s *ours*—ours in a way money can’t count.”

A silence stretches, wide and tender. A sparrow alights on the stone.

And then—unbidden, unscripted—you both begin to cry.

Not the angry, heaving kind. But the quiet kind—the kind that says: *We’re still here. We remember the same roots.*

When the tears slow, your friend looks at the stone, then at you. They pick it up, turn it once in their palm, and tuck it into your hand.  

“What if we don’t fight *against* them… but *with* each other?” they whisper.

The dream doesn’t end with victory or surrender. It ends with two hands clasped around a stone—warm now, alive—and the first true shared breath after the storm.

(And somewhere, in the edges of the dream, the garden sighs into bloom.) 🌱
