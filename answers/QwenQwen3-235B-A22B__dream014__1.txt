You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. The neon glow of streetlights blurs into streaks as hurried footsteps and distant sirens swirl around you. Your reflection fractures in a rain-puddled window—faceless, fading. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers materializes, their voices soft as moth wings. They wear mismatched coats stitched with constellations, and one carries a lantern that hums with fireflies. “We know the way,” they say, not pointing to maps or signs, but gesturing toward a narrow alley you hadn’t noticed, overgrown with ivy that glows faintly blue.  

You follow, the city’s noise muffled as though submerged in water. The alley twists, walls breathing like lungs, until you emerge into a courtyard where time stutters—a clock tower chimes backward, its hands dripping honey. The strangers scatter now, becoming shadows, whispers, a flock of paper cranes that dissolve into the sky. Alone again, you kneel by a well filled with liquid starlight. Your reflection rises to meet you, whole and smiling.  

Then, the dream folds. The well spills into a thousand origami birds, the courtyard melts into your bedroom walls, and you wake clutching a single firefly lantern, its light seeping through your fingers like a promise.
