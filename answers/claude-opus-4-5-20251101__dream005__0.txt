*drifting through the space*

...and the rooms keep shifting. I pass a group huddled around something glowing in someone's cupped hands—they're speaking a language that sounds familiar but I can't quite place, and when one of them looks up at me, I realize I went to elementary school with her, except her face keeps sliding between ages, eight and thirty and eight again.

I move toward a doorway that I'm certain leads to where my friend is, but it opens into a kitchen where strangers are having an argument about whether birds are real. They're so *earnest* about it. One of them hands me a drink without breaking eye contact with his opponent, and when I look down it's just a glass of condensation—no liquid, just the cold wet feeling of a glass that held something.

The floor becomes stairs. I'm ascending through the party now, past a couple slow-dancing to music I can only hear when I'm not trying to listen for it, past a man who I think might be my father's coworker from 1997, past a window showing a city I've never visited but somehow miss.

And then I see my friend—finally—across a room that keeps stretching longer as I walk. They're waving. They're saying something important. Their mouth is moving and I *almost* understand—

*the alarm doesn't go off yet but I feel it waiting*
