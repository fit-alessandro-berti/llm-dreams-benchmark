…and the trees around you begin to sway, their leaves hissing as the wind picks up. There’s an electricity in the air that prickles along your arms, and you notice the sky turning a strange violet-gray. The mossy ground, once soft underfoot, now feels charged with tension as if waiting for something to break loose.

You begin to move more quickly, stepping over gnarled roots and pushing low-hanging branches aside, when you see what looks like a faint glow off to the left. It’s subtle at first—a silvery shimmer behind a cluster of ferns. Another rumble of thunder rolls overhead, distant but insistent, as if summoning you to investigate. For some reason you feel compelled, even though an uneasy knot tightens in your stomach.

You push your way through the brush, damp leaves brushing your cheeks, until you come to a small clearing. Here, time seems to slow. The air is quieter despite the oncoming storm, and the breeze circles gently around a fallen log. Sitting atop that log is something you can’t quite define—it’s a figure, perhaps, draped in a shawl of mist and moonlight, although it’s midday and there’s no moon to be seen. Its face is indistinct, more a suggestion of a face than actual features, yet you have the strong feeling that it’s looking directly at you.

A fork of lightning illuminates the scene, and in that bright flash you see that the figure is holding something: a single leaf that glows as though lit from within. Suddenly, it whispers—though its voice is more like a sigh carried on the wind—and you can just make out a few words: “The path… for you to choose…”

Your heart pounds as the storm breaks overhead. Rain batters the leaves and the thunder grows louder. The figure lifts its arm slowly, extending the glowing leaf toward you. There’s a hint of urgency in the motion, as if offering a lifeline in the gathering chaos. You step forward, uncertain, each raindrop cold and heavy on your skin.

As your hand nears the leaf, you feel a warm current run through your fingertips. The forest around you blurs for a moment, as if the trees themselves are leaning in to witness the exchange. With trembling curiosity, you accept the leaf. Its radiance intensifies, and the storm’s roar fades into a muffled hush. The figure’s outlines dissolve into swirls of light and shadow, leaving only a gentle voice echoing in your mind:

“Find the clearing within yourself, and you will weather any storm.”

In that instant, you awaken—heart still pounding, fingers tingling, as if you truly held that glowing leaf. The memory of the forest and the mysterious figure lingers behind your eyes, and though the dream fades, its message remains.
