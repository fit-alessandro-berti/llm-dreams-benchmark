You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and… they shift. Not subtly—*they pulse*, like a heartbeat beneath the surface of the wood. The carvings seem to writhe, forming symbols you almost recognize: a spiral, a crescent moon, a labyrinth… and then, suddenly, they *stop*. The box goes still, but your pulse quickens.  

A faint hum resonates through the air, and the walls of the room you’re in (if it’s a room at all) ripple like heatwaves. You blink, and the space around you has changed. You’re no longer in a dim chamber but standing in a forest bathed in bioluminescent light. Trees glow with veins of silver, and the air smells of petrichor and something sweet, like ripe fruit. The box is now sitting on a mossy stone, its patterns glowing brighter, as if beckoning.  

A voice, not quite a voice, whispers in your mind: *“What do you seek?”* You startle, but the forest seems to hold its breath. The box’s lid creaks open on its own, revealing not a treasure but a mirror—*your own face, but older, weathered by time*. Behind it, a staircase spirals downward into darkness. The mirror’s surface ripples, and for a moment, you glimpse a shadowy figure watching you from the depths.  

You reach for the box, but the mirror shatters, shards falling like stardust. The forest dissolves, and you’re back in the original chamber, the box now open. Inside lies a single object: a key, but its handle is shaped like a serpent, and its teeth are made of light. As you grasp it, the room fades to black, and the dream… or whatever comes next… begins.
