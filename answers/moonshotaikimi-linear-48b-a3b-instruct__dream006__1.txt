…speak—but every word leaves a small glowing ember in the air. The embers hover between you and the audience, forming shifting pictures: the faces of people you’ve never met, places you’ve never been, moments you’ve never lived. Some embers burst into brief sparks and vanish, while others linger, growing brighter when the crowd gasps or leans forward. You realize the speech isn’t yours at all—it’s a collaboration, each ember yanked from someone else’s memory and fired in the shape of a story you’re weaving together in real time. When the last ember drifts down and extinguishes at your feet, the room is utterly silent. You take a bow, and for the first time you understand: the audience didn’t come to hear *you*—they came to remember something they’d forgotten they knew.
