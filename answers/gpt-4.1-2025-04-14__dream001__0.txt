You start to walk quickly, weaving through crowds that seem to move in slow motion around you. Every building is taller than the last, their windows reflecting a sky that shifts rapidly from morning blue to sunset gold and back again.

You reach into your pocket for your phone, hoping for directions, but instead pull out a crumpled map. The lines on it twist and re-form as you look, street names rearranging themselves. Somewhere in the distance, a clock tower chimes—but the hands spin backward.

You try to ask someone for help, but their faces blur into one another, impossible to focus on. You notice a small child tugging at your sleeve through the crowd. She points to a narrow alleyway, just visible between two endless skyscrapers. On impulse, you follow her, the noise of the city fading away behind you.

Down the alley, the path narrows until you must squeeze through sideways. At the end, a door appears, painted in bright, swirling colors. You open it, hoping your meeting is inside, and step through—

—into a sunlit rooftop garden, where a group of people sit waiting around a table, looking up as you arrive, as if they knew you would be exactly on time.
