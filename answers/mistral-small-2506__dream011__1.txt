**Dream Continuation:**

As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language you’ve never seen before—twisting, shifting symbols that seem to rearrange themselves when you blink. The room grows colder, and the air hums with an eerie static. The other students around you are eerily silent, their faces blank, as if they’ve already taken the test and forgotten the results.

You glance at the clock—it’s counting down, but the numbers are backward, and the hands spin in the wrong direction. Panic rises in your chest, but then you hear a whisper from the back of the room: *"The answers are in the margins."* You turn the page and see faint, glowing words written in the white space—words that only you can read.

As you begin to write, the ink on your paper turns to liquid silver, forming intricate patterns that seem to tell a story of their own. The room starts to dissolve, the walls melting into a swirling vortex of colors. The exam paper lifts from the desk, floating toward the ceiling, and you realize—this wasn’t an exam at all. It was a test of something far more important.

Then, just as the dream begins to unravel, you wake up—heart pounding, the afterimage of glowing symbols still flickering behind your eyelids.

**What do you think the dream was trying to tell you?**
