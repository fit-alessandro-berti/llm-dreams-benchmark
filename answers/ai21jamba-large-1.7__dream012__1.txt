You shout orders over the howling wind, your voice steady despite the chaos. "Secure the mainsail! Batten down the hatches! Brace for impact!" The crew springs into action, their movements practiced and precise despite the rolling waves. Rain lashes your face, and lightning cracks the sky, illuminating the towering waves threatening to engulf the ship.

A massive wave crashes over the bow, sending a spray of saltwater across the deck. You cling to the helm, fighting to keep the ship on course. The wood creaks ominously, and you can feel the ship strain under the storm's fury.

"Hold fast!" you roar. "We will weather this storm together!" The crew's determination mirrors your own, their faces set with grim resolve.

As the storm rages on, you spot a faint light through the sheets of rain—a lighthouse, barely visible on the distant shore. It's a beacon of hope in the midst of the storm.

"Steer for the light!" you command, and the crew redoubles their efforts. The ship lurches and groans, but slowly, ever so slowly, you begin to make headway.

The storm is unrelenting, but so are you. You will not yield. Not while your crew depends on you, not while there is still a chance toOutrun the storm andEspy safe harbor.
