The air, moments ago alive with birdsong, stills. The vibrant green canopy overhead darkens, not with the gentle approach of evening, but with a bruised, heavy purple. A restless wind stirs, rustling leaves with an ominous whisper, carrying the electric tang of ozone. My peaceful walk has transformed into an unsettling prelude.

The distant rumble of thunder, low and guttural, confirms my unease. It's not the ordinary thunder I know, the kind that heralds a cleansing summer rain. This is deeper, more primal, vibrating in my bones. The wind escalates, whipping my hair across my face and tugging at my clothes. Trees sway with alarming violence, their branches groaning like distressed creatures.

A flash of lightning rips across the sky, a jagged scar against the purpling canvas. It illuminates the forest for a stark, terrifying instant, revealing the unnatural speed at which the storm is gathering. The trees, moments ago a source of comfort, now seem to twist and writhe in the wind, their shadows lengthening into monstrous shapes.

Large, heavy drops of rain begin to fall, splattering against the forest floor with an almost violent impact. They aren't the refreshing drops of a normal downpour. These feel cold and unnervingly thick, clinging to my skin like tears of some unseen, weeping entity. 

The wind intensifies to a furious gale, nearly knocking me off my feet. I struggle to stay upright, the roaring wind drowning out all other sounds. Then, above the tempest, I hear it: a high-pitched, keening wail that cuts through the storm like a knife. It's not the sound of an animal, or the wind. It's something else, something… sentient.

Fear, cold and sharp, pierces through the adrenaline coursing through my veins. The forest, no longer a place of peace, feels charged with a menacing energy. I turn to run, to escape the encroaching darkness and the chilling wail, but my feet feel leaden. The ground beneath me begins to tremble, vibrating in sync with the strange, mournful sound. 

Then, just as I'm about to be overwhelmed by the storm's fury, I wake up. My heart pounds in my chest, the remnants of the dream's terror clinging to me like the phantom rain. The familiar comfort of my room slowly replaces the oppressive darkness of the dream forest, but the unsettling feeling lingers. I'm left with the distinct impression that the storm wasn't just a dream, but a warning. A warning of what, I don't know. But the memory of the keening wail echoes in my mind, a haunting reminder that not all storms can be weathered.
