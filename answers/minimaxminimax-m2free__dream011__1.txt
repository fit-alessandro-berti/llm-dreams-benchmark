Somewhere between two syllables of your own heartbeat, the exam room becomes a field. The desks breathe, the fluorescent lights turn soft as dusk, and the air smells faintly of old books and rain. The proctor—their face is your high school geometry teacher and your first boss at once—slides a stack of papers that slide like water.

The first page asks simply: Identify your future. The second: List three reasons to doubt your reasons. You flip it over, and the third page is a map with no cardinal directions and a pen that tries to write itself. The questions are quiet enough to hum.

You flip again.

The questions are the same, except:

- “One bus leaves at noon from the train station” becomes “One myth leaves at noon, which train is it?”
- “Evaluate the integral of a function’s courage over its doubts” glows faintly.
- “Give an example of nontrivial forgiveness.”
- “Draw the missing instrument and use it to measure time differently.”
- “Name the one thing your body knows that you do not.”
- “State Newton’s Third Law, and then state its opposite, as if it also were true.”

The margins edge into dew. A figure near the window hums a lullaby that never ends. A clock in the ceiling watches you back. You click your pen twice; it clacks like a pebble in a well. You begin.

You circle “Show work” in gold. You write that courage grows in the measurable spaces between caution and care. You cross out “integral,” sketch the bus and the myth, label the myth “future” and the bus “time.” Your eraser smells like summer. A drip from the air vent decides to be a metronome, and the whole room keeps it.

By the time you reach “Prove the opposite of the opposite equals itself,” the paper knows your handwriting better than you do. You write, instead of proof, a story about a door that exists so that someone else can come through it. The paper lights up, and somewhere in a far row a pencil sprouts a leaf.

One question asks for the answer to a question you aren’t sure you want answered. You leave a blank shaped like a question mark. You write a note to the version of you who will wake up later, asking them to remember the rain in the exam room. You smile at that, because it feels like a dare from your own sleep.

A clock opens like a shell. Light spills, and the field takes a breath.

Behind the last page, a single word appears, steady as a heartbeat: Continue. You take the hint as a promise.
