**Dream Completion:**  

You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language that shifts and morphs as you read them. The paper is blank, but the air hums with a low, melodic vibration, as if the questions are whispering to you from another dimension.  

**First Question:**  
*“What is the weight of a thought when it is not yours?”*  
You look up, and the room has dissolved into a vast, swirling galaxy of floating notes and half-formed equations. The teacher, a figure with no face and eyes that blink like stars, leans forward. “Answer the question, or you will be lost in the void between questions.”  

**Second Question:**  
*“If you could choose one memory to erase, which would it be—and why?”*  
You see flashes of your past: a childhood dream, a lost love, a moment of fear. The question seems to *touch* you, as if it’s not just asking but *remembering*. You feel the weight of a choice that haunts you, but you can’t yet answer.  

**Third Question:**  
*“What is the color of silence when the world is speaking?”*  
The room erupts into a cacophony of voices—your own, your parents’, the wind, the rustling of pages. You realize the question is a riddle, not a test of knowledge, but of *listening*. You close your eyes and hear the silence between the sounds, a deep, metallic gray. You write it down, but the ink bleeds into the paper, becoming a swirling, impossible shape.  

**Final Question:**  
*“If you could become a single word, what would you be—and what would you say to the world?”*  
The exam paper becomes a mirror, and you see yourself as a flickering, shapeless thing. You feel the pressure of the world on your chest, the weight of all the choices you’ve made and not made. You whisper, *“I am the question that never ends,”* and the room shudders.  

When you finish, the clock stops. The teacher smiles, and the exam paper dissolves into smoke. You wake up gasping, covered in cold sweat, but your hands still hold the answers.  

**Epilogue:**  
In the morning, you realize the exam was a dream, but the answers linger. You go back to sleep, hoping the questions will come again—and this time, you might be ready.
