...and you feel a wave of panic rising in your chest, your heart pounding like a drum in a silent room. The office around you starts to warp—the fluorescent lights flicker and stretch into elongated beams, casting shadows that twist like living vines across the cubicle walls. Your boss, usually a stern figure in a crisp suit, now looms larger than life, his face morphing into a clock with hands spinning wildly backward. "Tick-tock," he booms, his voice echoing as if from the bottom of a well. "The deadline is yesterday!"

You glance at your desk, and the project files aren't papers anymore—they're a pile of shimmering puzzle pieces, each one glowing with cryptic symbols that shift and rearrange themselves. You reach out to grab one, but your hand passes right through it, turning ethereal and translucent. Suddenly, you realize you can float. With a tentative push, you lift off the ground, hovering above your chair, and the impossible deadline doesn't seem so daunting anymore. "I can do this," you think, and as you wave your arms, the puzzle pieces begin to assemble themselves in mid-air, forming a massive, glowing structure—a bridge? A rocket? No, it's a portal, swirling with colors you've never seen before.

Your boss-clock-face smiles, the minute hand curling into a thumbs-up. "See? Dreams have no deadlines," he says, and just like that, the office dissolves into a starry sky. You're soaring through the clouds now, the project complete in an instant, leaving you weightless and free. But as the stars blur into streaks of light, you feel a gentle tug—a familiar alarm clock beeping in the distance. The dream fades, and you wake up in your bed, heart still racing, wondering if that project was ever real at all. Or was it just the beginning of another impossible day?
