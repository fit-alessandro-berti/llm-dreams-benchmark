As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and **faint, bioluminescent veins that seem to pulse in rhythm with your own breathing. The wood isn’t cold; it has the startling warmth of a living thing. As your thumb brushes a carved lotus in the center, the petals begin to shift and rotate with a sound like grinding sea glass.**

**Suddenly, the gravity in the room tilts. The box doesn’t just sit in your hands—it begins to expand, its shadows stretching across the floor like spilled ink. You realize the patterns aren't just decorations; they are a map of a city you’ve never visited but somehow remember perfectly.**

**One of the carved lines leaps off the surface, becoming a golden thread that winds around your wrist, pulling your hand toward a hidden seam. You don’t need a key. You realize the box is waiting for a weight, not a tool. You place your forehead against the lid and exhale a secret you’ve never told anyone.**

**The wood softens into the consistency of water. Your hands sink into the box, and instead of hitting the bottom, you feel the rush of cold, night air. The box unfolds like a blooming flower, growing until it becomes a doorway. You step through, leaving the room behind, and find yourself standing on a bridge made of starlight, looking down at a world where the buildings are made of the same intricate patterns you just touched.**

**In your hand, the box is gone, replaced by a single, heavy silver key. You look up, and the moon is watching you with a familiar, knowing eye.**
