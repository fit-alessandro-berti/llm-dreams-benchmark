As you move deeper into the maze, the puzzles become increasingly intricate and demanding. The walls of the maze are made of towering, ancient stone, adorned with symbols that seem to shift and change as you try to decipher them. The air is thick with a sense of mystery and challenge.

You approach a junction where a riddle is inscribed on a stone tablet:

**"I am taken from a mine, and shut up in a wooden case, from which I am never released, and yet I am used by almost every person. What am I?"**

You ponder the riddle, your mind racing through possibilities. The answer, you realize, is "pencil lead" or "graphite." With a sense of satisfaction, the stone tablet glows briefly, and a path forward is revealed.

Further ahead, you encounter a room filled with mirrors. The mirrors reflect not just your image, but also fragments of different puzzles. One mirror shows a sequence of numbers, another a pattern of shapes, and a third a set of cryptic symbols. You must solve all three puzzles simultaneously to proceed. The numbers form a Fibonacci sequence, the shapes are arranged in increasing geometric complexity, and the symbols match a pattern found in ancient runes.

As you solve each puzzle, the mirrors begin to shimmer and then dissolve, revealing a narrow corridor. At the end of the corridor, you find a grand chamber with a pedestal in the center. On the pedestal lies a glowing orb. As you approach, a voice echoes through the chamber:

**"Your journey has led you here, but the final test awaits. Answer this: What is the one thing that is always true about the future?"**

You ponder the question, understanding that it requires a philosophical answer rather than a logical solution. The correct response comes to you: **"The future is always uncertain."**

The orb pulses with light, and the walls of the maze begin to crumble. You find yourself standing in a vast, open field under a clear blue sky. The mists of the maze dissipate, and you feel a sense of accomplishment and clarity. The dreamscape shifts once more, and you wake up with a smile, knowing that the puzzles and challenges you faced will stay with you as lessons learned.
