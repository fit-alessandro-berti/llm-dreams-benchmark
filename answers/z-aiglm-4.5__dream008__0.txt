You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you...  

**...stare at the project brief, which is written in shimmering, shifting letters that rearrange themselves into impossible equations. The wall clock behind your boss melts like wax, dripping golden seconds onto the carpet. Your boss’s face flickers between their own and a stranger’s angular, metallic features.**  

Suddenly, the office dissolves. You’re standing in a vast, empty library where books float in mid-air. A single document on your desk reads: *"Deadline: Yesterday. Deliver: 37 years of market analysis in 5 minutes."*  

Your boss taps their watch—a sundial glowing with neon light. "Tick-tock," they hum, their voice layered with echoes.  

**You reach for your pen, but it’s a feather quill dipped in liquid starlight. As you touch the page, the words write themselves:**  

*Project Manifesto*  
1. **Time is liquid.** You dip your hands into the dripping clock-seconds, molding them like clay. A year becomes a droplet. A decade fits in your palm.  
2. **Data grows like trees.** Floating-books sprout roots into your desk. Numbers blossom into charts, then fruit you pluck and arrange into a perfect report.  
3. **Your boss is an idea.** Their metallic face cracks, revealing a swirling galaxy of "URGENCY," "EXPECTATION," and "FEAR." You nod at it. "I’m not afraid of shadows," you whisper.  

The galaxy-face smiles, fractal and kind. The library folds into origami cranes that carry the report away.  

Your desk is now a beach. Waves lap at your feet. The deadline isn’t a blade—it’s a seashell humming: *"Rested. Ready."*  

**You wake up.** Your real alarm buzzes. For a second, the glow of the dream’s seashell still lingers on your pillow. You smile. Even impossible deadlines make sense when time bends.  

*(Stress dissolves. You open your laptop and begin.)*
