You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak—but the words that emerge are not your own.

The first sentence comes out in a voice you barely recognize, deep and resonant, as if someone else is speaking through your throat. The lights are blindingly bright, hot on your face, and you can feel sweat prickling along your hairline despite the chill that runs through your arms. The sea of faces blurs at the edges, hundreds of eyes fixed on you like mirrors reflecting a version of yourself you've never met.

You meant to talk about your career, perhaps, or some lesson you've learned—but instead, you find yourself telling a story about a door. A door you've been walking past your entire life without noticing. The audience leans forward, rapt, as if you've just revealed something sacred. You describe the door's worn brass handle, the way the wood has darkened with years of being touched but never turned, and something in your chest tightens because you realize with sudden clarity that this door exists somewhere, perhaps right now, in the waking world, waiting.

A child in the front row raises their hand, and you stop mid-sentence to acknowledge them. "Where does the door lead?" they ask, their voice small against the vastness of the auditorium. You open your mouth to answer, but the dream is already shifting—the stage dissolving at the edges like watercolor bleeding into water, the audience's faces melting into abstraction, and you feel yourself falling forward into the space between sleep and waking, still clutching the memory of that door, still wondering.
