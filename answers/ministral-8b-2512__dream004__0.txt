In your dream, the blank canvas shimmers like a living thing, its edges pulsing faintly with the same shifting hues of the world around you. As you step closer, the air hums with possibility—each breath you take leaves tiny, fleeting imprints on its surface, like ghostly fingerprints dissolving into the air.

Then, something unexpected happens:

A voice—neither yours nor anyone else’s—whispers from the canvas itself. *"You don’t need to paint it. It’s already here."* The words aren’t spoken aloud; they vibrate through your bones, a sensation like static electricity or the first note of a forgotten song. You look down, and your hands begin to glow faintly, as if the colors of the world have seeped into your skin.

The canvas *moves*. It stretches and warps, forming a door—no, a *window*—into a place that wasn’t there before. Through it, you see:
- A forest where the trees are made of liquid silver, their branches rearranging themselves into constellations as you watch.
- A city of geometric towers that dissolve into smoke when you blink, only to reform into something entirely different by the time you look again.
- A single, perfect sphere hovering in midair, pulsing with the same rhythm as your heartbeat. When you reach for it, your fingers pass through it like mist, but the moment you *want* it, the sphere splits open to reveal a tiny, glowing seed.

The voice returns, softer this time: *"Choose."*

You have three options:
1. **Step through the window**—but the moment you do, the world outside it collapses into a void of pure sound, a symphony of colors you’ve never seen before. You’re not sure if you’re falling or flying.
2. **Plant the seed**—but the moment you touch it, the ground beneath you *lifts*, revealing a labyrinth of roots and vines that weren’t there seconds ago. The seed whispers back: *"It remembers you."*
3. **Let the canvas paint itself**—if you stand perfectly still, the colors begin to swirl around you like a storm, and suddenly, you’re not holding a canvas anymore. You’re *inside* it, a living brushstroke in a painting that’s still being made. The world outside the frame is just as surreal, but now you’re part of it—your movements ripple through the scene like a pebble in water.

What do you do?

*(Or—if you’d like to take a different turn, let me know! This dream is yours to shape.)*
