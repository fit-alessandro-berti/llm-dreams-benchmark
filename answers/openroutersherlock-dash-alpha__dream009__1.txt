You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **adapt quickly to survive in this ancient world of towering ziggurats, bustling clay-brick markets, and the distant roar of war chariots under a blazing Mesopotamian sun**.

The air is thick with the scent of incense, baked mud, and river silt from the mighty Tigris. You're dressed in a simple linen kilt, your feet bare on the sun-warmed earth. No phone, no wallet, no ID—just you, dropped into Sumeria around 2000 BCE, in the shadow of Ur's great temple to the moon god Nanna.

**First steps in the dream:** You stumble into a crowded marketplace where merchants hawk barley, dates, and shimmering lapis lazuli. A cuneiform tablet catches your eye—your "quest log" etched by some dream-weaver god. It reads:

1. **Forage or trade for sustenance**: Spot a vendor with flatbreads and fish from the river. No cash? Offer labor—carry amphorae of beer for a meal.

2. **Learn the lingo**: Locals speak a guttural proto-Akkadian. Mimic their gestures: bowed head for respect, open palms for "friend." Dream intuition translates: "An gal-zu!" (I know it!)

3. **Seek allies**: A grizzled potter eyes you suspiciously but nods toward the ziggurat. Join a work gang hauling reeds for the temple—safety in numbers, plus free goat stew.

**Rising tension**: As dusk falls, drums echo from the city walls. Envoys from a rival city-state approach, demanding tribute. You're swept into the chaos—a spy? A prophet? The priest-king mistakes your modern gaze for divine wisdom and thrusts a bronze dagger into your hand. "Defend the city, star-man!"

**Climactic twist**: In the dream's fevered blur, you lead a ragtag band atop the ziggurat, using forgotten physics knowledge to rig a catapult from ropes and stones. Enemies scatter like startled goats. Dawn breaks; the high priest crowns you with gold, whispering, "You are Inanna's chosen."

But as victory horns blare, the world shimmers... your alarm clock buzzes faintly in the distance. Do you seize the throne forever, or wake with sand in your sheets and a craving for ancient flatbread? The dream fades—your choice?
