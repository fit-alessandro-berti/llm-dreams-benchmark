You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to **panic. The architecture is a dizzying mix of styles - shimmering, chrome skyscrapers that pierce the swirling, lavender sky, juxtaposed with crumbling, moss-covered buildings that seem to be made of baked clay. Cars, which look like sleek, bioluminescent jellyfish, float silently through the air, and I can't even figure out how to hail one. My heart hammers against my ribs like a trapped hummingbird. I frantically pat my pockets, hoping for a crumpled address, a phone, anything. But all I find is a small, smooth, obsidian stone that feels strangely warm in my hand.**

**The air hums with an almost palpable energy, and the sounds are a cacophony: a high-pitched, trilling music that seems to emanate from the skyscrapers; the hushed, rhythmic chanting coming from the crumbling buildings; and a low, persistent thrumming that resonates deep within my bones. People, or perhaps *beings*, flow past me like a river, their faces a blur of impossible colours and shifting features. Some are tall and slender with skin like polished jade, others are short and stout with skin like rough bark. Some have multiple eyes, or no eyes at all. They all seem completely oblivious to my distress.**

**I squeeze the obsidian stone in my hand, and a jolt of electricity seems to run through my arm. Suddenly, a faint whisper brushes against my ear, a voice I can't quite place, but which feels familiar, like a memory just out of reach. *Follow the light… the one that doesn't shine.* I look around, desperately searching for any light source. The shimmering skyscrapers throw off a blinding array of colours, and the city itself is awash in an ethereal glow. But then, my gaze falls on something else.**

**In the distance, I see it. A single, flickering flame, emanating from within one of the crumbling buildings. It's not bright, not showy. It's almost swallowed by the shadows, a small, defiant ember in a sea of dazzling light. My heart leaps. Could this be it? Is this where I need to go? The dream then abruptly shifts to a strange image of myself running, but what direction? And why does this obsidian stone suddenly feel so heavy?**
