...decide to reach out and grab the angry words hanging in the air between us. They feel physical, like hot, jagged stones in my hands. As soon as I touch them, the sound of our voices shuts off completely, as if someone pulled a plug.

I look down and realize the floor has turned into deep, dark water. We aren't sinking, just standing on the surface tension. The "important thing" we were arguing about is floating between us, but now it looks like a glowing, glass geometric shape that hums with a low vibration.

I try to hand the stones back to you, but your face begins to blur like a wet watercolor painting. You try to step toward me, but the distance between us stretches infinitely, like a hallway in a movie. You shout, but instead of sound, bubbles of blue light drift from your mouth and float upward.

I decide to dive into the floor-water to save the glowing shape, but as I go under, I realize I can breathe perfectly fine, and the water is actually just thick, cool air. I wake up before I hit the bottom.
