You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, you begin to notice that the walls shift subtly when you're not looking—like the maze is alive, testing your resolve.

The air grows heavier, thick with the scent of old paper and forgotten knowledge. Every room you enter is different: one is a library where books whisper riddles, another is a clockwork chamber with gears that spin in impossible patterns, and a third is a mirror maze where reflections don’t quite match your movements.

With each puzzle you solve, a piece of a larger mystery unfolds. You start to remember fragments of a life you never lived—a scientist who vanished trying to unlock the secrets of time, a philosopher trapped between reality and illusion, a child who dreamed of escaping a world that didn’t understand them.

As you reach the heart of the maze, you find a door that doesn’t have a handle. Instead, it’s etched with a single question: *"What do you fear most?"* The words shimmer and change, reflecting your deepest anxieties.

You realize this isn’t just a test of logic—it’s a test of self. To escape, you must confront the truth you’ve been avoiding. And as you stand before the door, you feel the weight of the dream pressing in, urging you to choose: stay in the maze, forever solving puzzles to avoid the real world… or wake up, and face whatever awaits beyond the dream.

What will you do?
