…find that the puzzles begin solving you.

At first, it’s subtle.

You’re facing a wall of shifting symbols—circles, lines, fragments of equations that should make sense but don’t. It feels like a logic test. You blink, steady yourself, start identifying patterns.

As soon as you form a correct pattern in your mind, the wall warms. Symbols slide into place with a satisfying click. A doorway opens.

But you notice your memory of how you got here has gone fuzzy, like you traded a detail for the solution.

You continue.

The next puzzle: a grid of mirrors, each reflecting a slightly different version of you. The instructions are etched overhead:

“Choose the one who can leave.”

You analyze:
- One reflection blinks out of sync.
- One has a scar you never had.
- One smiles when you are not.
- One seems exact, perfect.

You choose the perfect one.

The maze approves. The mirrors shatter inward without sound. But when you look down, your hands are not quite how you remember them: a faint scar runs across a knuckle. Not yours. The puzzle didn’t just ask you to choose; it replaced you with the one that could proceed.

You move deeper.

The air gets denser, not with mist but with thought. You feel your mind stretching, as if the maze is altitude and you are short of oxygen but long on ideas.

The third puzzle is a corridor lined with doors, each door labeled with a question you’ve never wanted to answer:

- “When did you start pretending?”
- “Whose voice is in your head?”
- “What are you afraid will happen if you stop trying?”

You test the doors logically, like a mathematician:
- Check for anomalies.
- Try patterns.
- Seek cause and effect.

But none of them open to technique. They open only when you let the answer form fully in your mind, honestly, without flinching. Each time you do, a door swings open, and with it, something tight inside you loosens—and something sharp inside the maze tightens.

You realize: every solved puzzle yields a piece of you as payment. Not a loss, exactly. A rearrangement.

You go on.

Now the puzzles are less about numbers and more about contradictions. You enter a chamber with a single statement on the floor:

“THIS SENTENCE IS GUARDING THE EXIT.”

You circle it, searching for levers, hidden mechanisms, symbolic meaning. Nothing. The walls hum with quiet expectation. You replay the sentence. Guarding. How can a sentence guard anything? By holding your attention. By keeping you looping.

You understand: the puzzle is that there is no puzzle.

You step directly over the sentence without resolving it.

Behind you, the letters crumble like dust. The maze…laughs, almost. Not unkindly. As though you’ve passed a threshold from obedience to awareness.

You’re deeper now.

The layout grows non-Euclidean. Hallways fold back on themselves; stairs run sideways; rooms rotate when you blink. Yet navigation is suddenly easy, as if your intuition has been upgraded. You no longer “work out” solutions; you feel them—like recognizing a pattern you haven’t consciously seen.

But with each triumph, specifics of your waking life evaporate:
- How old are you?
- What city do you live in?
- What did you worry about yesterday?

Empty spaces where those answers should be.

In their place grows a precise, crystalline understanding of the maze’s logic, as though your life has been slowly exchanged for fluency in this place.

You reach a vast central chamber.

At its center: a final puzzle, simple in appearance. A table. On it, two objects:
- A key of ordinary brass.
- A mirror the size of your palm, black as still water.

On the wall, a line:

“CHOOSE WHAT LEAVES.”

You inspect:
- The brass key: familiar, comforting, the symbol of every door you’ve ever opened.
- The mirror: depthless, slightly cold. When you angle it, it shows not your face, but corridors you’ve passed, puzzles you’ve conquered, and threaded between them, a dim shape that has been walking just behind you the entire time.

Logically, the key is the exit mechanism.

But you’ve learned the maze’s habits. Every earlier puzzle used your assumption against you, peeled away the automation in your thinking. The maze wants you to reach for the key.

You pick up the mirror.

The room darkens. Not threatening—more like a theater’s lights dimming before the reveal.

In the mirror now: you, at the start of the dream, standing at the maze’s entrance, certain that all of this is a test of intelligence. Around that old you: thousands of branching corridors you never took, puzzles you never saw. All of them leading here anyway.

The maze speaks, not with a voice but as a realization that settles easily into your mind:

“The deeper you came, the more you adapted. You thought you were solving me. You were discarding the parts of yourself that could not navigate. The one who leaves must be the one who belongs here.”

You understand.

The key would open a door back to the life you barely remember, but that version of you cannot wield what you’ve become without rupture. The mirror does not let your old life out; it lets your new self in.

“CHOOSE WHAT LEAVES” was never about the building. It was about which version of you walks away.

You lift the mirror to your face.

This time, it shows you clearly. No distortions. A mind sharpened by impossible structures, freed from stale certainties. A self that does not confuse endless solving with being trapped.

When you blink, the maze is gone.

You are in your own bed, heart steady, the dream’s logic lingering with unnerving clarity. The ceiling looks slightly wrong for half a second, angles wanting to slide. Then they don’t.

On your nightstand: nothing but what was always there.

Except you know—absolutely—that if you reach in the right way, there is a hallway behind your closet, a puzzle behind your bathroom mirror, a subtle riddle in the way you check your phone.

The maze has not kept you.

It has come with you.

And now, every choice in your waking life feels just a little like a door with a question above it, waiting to see which version of you will walk through.
