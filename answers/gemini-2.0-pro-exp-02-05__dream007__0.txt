... you decide to **walk away, not in anger, but in a desperate attempt to cool down the simmering lava that threatened to erupt from both of us.** The words, sharp and cutting, still echoed in the air, suspended between us like invisible daggers. I could feel the throb of my own pulse in my temples, a frantic drumbeat mirroring the chaotic rhythm of the argument.

As I walked, the familiar streets of my neighborhood blurred. The houses became distorted, elongated and twisted, as if viewed through a funhouse mirror. The sky, normally a comforting expanse of blue, swirled with an unnatural, oily green and purple, like a bruise blooming across the heavens. The sounds of the city – car horns, distant sirens, children's laughter – were muffled and distorted, replaced by a low, humming drone that seemed to vibrate deep within my bones.

I found myself walking towards a park I'd never seen before, even though I knew this area like the back of my hand. It was overgrown, the trees impossibly tall and their branches gnarled and twisted, forming a dense, impenetrable canopy that blocked out most of the sickly light. The air hung heavy and humid, thick with the scent of something unfamiliar – a mixture of sweet decay and something metallic, like blood.

Suddenly, I saw my friend. They were sitting on a moss-covered bench, facing away from me. But it wasn't *really* them. Or, at least, not entirely. Their outline shimmered, flickering in and out of focus like a faulty projection. As I approached, I could see that their back was covered in… feathers. Large, iridescent feathers, like those of a peacock, but a deep, unsettling shade of crimson.

"Hey," I said, my voice sounding strange and thin even to my own ears.

The figure slowly turned, and my breath caught in my throat. It was my friend's face, but it was… wrong. Their eyes glowed with an unnatural, golden light, and their mouth was stretched into a smile that was far too wide, revealing rows of sharp, needle-like teeth.

The feathered-friend-creature spoke, but the voice wasn't my friend's. It was a chorus of whispers, a multitude of voices layered on top of each other, echoing from the depths of the overgrown park. "The argument… was only the beginning," the chorus whispered. "Now… we choose sides."

And then, from the shadows of the trees, I saw them. Figures, also shimmering, also partially human, but all twisted and distorted in different, horrifying ways. Some had antlers, others had claws, still others had wings of bone and shadow. They began to circle us, slowly, silently, their eyes burning with that same unsettling golden light. And I knew, with a chilling certainty, that this dream-argument, this *real* argument, had just become something much, much larger... and I had to choose.
