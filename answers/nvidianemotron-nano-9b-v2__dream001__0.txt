You start to wander through the city’s labyrinthine streets, the air humming with a strange, static energy. Buildings loom at impossible angles, their facades shifting like liquid glass, and the sky above is a swirling tapestry of colors that don’t quite match. A voice echoes in your mind—soft, familiar, yet foreign—*“The meeting is not where you think it is. Follow the shadow of your own footsteps.”*  

You pause, confused, but the voice is insistent. As you walk, the ground beneath your feet begins to glow faintly, revealing a path that wasn’t there before. The path leads to a towering structure that defies logic: a library with no doors, its shelves stretching into infinity, filled with books that open on their own, their pages whispering in languages you don’t recognize.  

Inside, you find a single chair at the center of the room. A figure sits there, cloaked in shadows, but their face is a mirror of your own. They smile. *“You’ve been searching for this all along,”* they say. *“The meeting is within you. The city is a reflection of your uncertainty. The hour is not a limit—it’s a question.”*  

Suddenly, the room dissolves into a cascade of stars, and you find yourself back in the city, but now the streets are familiar. The meeting place is a small café you’ve never noticed before, its sign flickering with your name. As you enter, the clock strikes 12:00, but the hands spin backward. You realize the meeting wasn’t about a place or a time—it was about confronting the unknown, and in doing so, you’ve found clarity.  

When you wake up, the city is gone, but you carry a strange sense of peace. The meeting, you think, was never about finding a location. It was about finding yourself.
