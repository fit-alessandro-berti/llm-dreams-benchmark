**Continuation of the Dream**

...start to panic, feeling a wave of anxiety wash over me as I glance around at the sea of unfamiliar skyscrapers, neon lights, and bustling streets. Every face in the crowd seems to hurry with a sense of purpose, except mine. I clutch my briefcase tightly, hoping against hope that the meeting details might miraculously materialize within its worn leather interior, but I know I haven't checked it in a while.

**Actions and Sensations in the Dream:**

1. **Checking Briefcase (Again)**: I swiftly open my briefcase, rummaging through the neatly organized folders and documents. My fingers brush against a crumpled piece of paper at the bottom. Unfolding it reveals a scribbled note: "Elysium Tower, Suite 304. Ask for Elijah." No map, no directions, just the name and number.

2. **Approaching a Local**: With the note in hand, I stop one of the rushing pedestrians, a woman with a kind face and a backpack full of what appears to be artistic supplies. "Excuse me, could you please tell me where the Elysium Tower is?" I ask, trying to sound calmer than I feel. She looks at me with a hint of amusement, "New here, huh? Elysium's on the other side of the river. You can't miss it—it's the one with the sky garden that's always lit up like a cloud."

3. **Racing Against Time**: With newfound direction, I hail a taxi. The driver, a gruff but efficient man, raises an eyebrow at my urgency. "Elysium Tower, fast as we can. Meeting." He grunts in acknowledgment and weaves through the traffic with a skill that both impresses and terrifies me.

4. ** Arrival and Ascension**: We arrive just as my watch hits the hour. I pay the driver and leap out, sprinting towards the majestic Elysium Tower. The lobby is sleek and futuristic, with a holographic receptionist guiding visitors. "Elijah, Suite 304," I manage to get out, still catching my breath. The hologram nods, "Elevator 7, to your right. Mr. Elijah is expecting you."
