…speak, and the first sound you make is not a sentence but a color — a thin, trembling line of cerulean that unfurls from your mouth and hangs in the air like ribbon caught on a breeze. For a moment you panic: it is easier to hear people in your head than this, but the crowd does not look confused. They lean forward as if they too can taste the color, as if every hue carries meaning.

You try again; this time a word comes, but it is not made of sound at all. It is a small, warm thing that drops into the floorboards and becomes a seed. Somewhere beneath the stage, something answers with a soft, rooty laugh, and the seed sprouts into a sapling whose leaves are tiny notebooks. The audience tilts their heads toward the new tree, reading pages that flutter open and fill the auditorium with the scent of old paper and rain.

Your prepared speech—those crisp, rational paragraphs—crumbles in your hands like dry bread. You let them go. Instead you begin to tell one true, ridiculous story: how once you lost a shoe in a tidepool and found a song in its sole. With each image you offer, the people around you change: a woman whose glasses have been fogged with worry clears them and watches bubbles of moonlight float up from the stage; an older man’s hands, folded for years, unclench and reach toward a child in the third row who has been holding a paper airplane for reasons you will never know.

Soon you realize you are not speaking at them; you are speaking out a bridge. Each sentence is a plank laid down over the dark between you and another human face. When you stop to breathe, someone stands and crosses. They bring back a feather, a story, a laugh like a match struck in winter. You ask for nothing grand—no applause, no perfect phrasing—only the small, fragile exchange of being seen. The lights soften into dusk; the microphones turn into lanterns.

At the very end, the auditorium folds like a map, shrinking until the crowd fits into the palm of your hand: a constellation of tiny, listening faces. You tilt your head and listen back at them. They are breathing, thinking, carrying their own weight of nights. You bow, not out of performance but in gratitude, and when you step off the stage the boards smell like the sea and the world seems, just for a moment, simpler. You wake with the echo of a single, patient clap still thrumming under your ribs, or you keep dreaming and walk home with a pocket full of feathers and the memory of a speech that became a bridge.
