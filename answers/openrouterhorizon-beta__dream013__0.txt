find the corridors narrowing, the walls breathing softly like some enormous creature asleep around you. The puzzles shift from familiar riddles to strange, living problems: a door that only opens when you reconcile two contradictory statements aloud; a floor of tiles that light up in sequences matching your heartbeat, demanding you slow it with your mind to cross safely. You begin to notice that every solution leaves a faint glow on your hands, like dust from a chalkboard, except it hums—an afterimage of thought.

Your concentration sharpens into a point, and the maze seems to respond, angles straightening as if embarrassed by their own confusion. You enter a chamber where the puzzle is a constellation suspended in midair: threads of starlight connected by knots you can pluck like strings. The pattern refuses to resolve until you realize it mirrors your childhood ceiling stickers, rearranged by time. You hum the tune your mother used to sing, and the knots loosen, stars drifting into the doorway ahead.

Deeper, the puzzles become personal. A mirror demands that you prove you are not the person you were last year. You list the books you loved and left, the apologies you made and meant, the new callus along your thumb from holding different tools. The mirror fogs and nods, and you pass.

At the heart of the maze you find a final chamber, circular and silent, the air tasting like the moment before rain. In the center stands a table with an unfinished puzzle sprawled across it: pieces shaped like moments instead of edges—laughter in a kitchen at dusk, a train window smeared with rain, a quiet anger you carried too long. There is no picture on the box, only a question written on the underside: What pattern do you choose?

You sit. You fit pieces not by force but by recognition, feeling the click of acceptance in your chest when they meet. As the puzzle grows, the walls dissolve into a horizon. The maze, you realize, was never made of stone; it was made of decisions. The last piece is small and bright and warm. When you place it, the table lifts and unfolds into a staircase of light.

You climb, heart steady, and at the top you find a door with your name written in a handwriting you have not used in years. You open it, expecting daylight, but beyond is a quiet room with a single window. Outside, the maze spreads like a map drawn on water, reshaping itself with every breath you take. You smile, because you know the way now: not out, but through. The window swings open, and the breeze smells like new paper and ocean salt.

You step forward and wake with the taste of an answer you can’t quite pronounce, your hands still faintly humming.
