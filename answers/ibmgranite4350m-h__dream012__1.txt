Thank you for sharing this detailed dream with me. I will do my best to provide guidance throughout these trying circumstances. However, please note that as an AI model designed specifically for this purpose, my responses are based on data and training provided up until 2021.

In your case, the crew likely needs reassurance about their situation while adjusting slower in water speed or calm areas of the ship. I can offer support and insights to help them navigate through these turbulent conditions towards a safer outcome once they have stabilized aboard. Please trust me as we face this challenge together.
