You scramble to your feet, but your legs feel like lead, as if the floor is dragging you down. The impossible project title blurs on the screen in front of you: **"Reconcile the Quantum Entanglement Ledgers for the Multiverse Expansion Initiative"**. The deadline? **"Yesterday (Priority: Universal Extinction Avoidance)"**.

Your boss stands beside your desk, unnaturally still, his smile a little too wide, his tie pattern shifting like a glitchy hologram. "Chop-chop!" he says, his voice echoing strangely. "The cosmic auditors are *impatient*. We need those cross-dimensional taxonomies reconciled *before* the heat death of this particular universe iteration. Tick-tock!"

You stare at the keyboard. The keys are melting, dripping onto the desk like molten plastic. Your fingers fumble, trying to grasp the slick, dissolving keys. Panic surges, cold and heavy. You haven't eaten. You haven't slept. You don't even know what a "Quantum Entanglement Ledger" *is*.

Suddenly, your chair morphs into a tricycle. You try to pedal towards the printer, but it rolls backward. The fluorescent lights above flicker violently, casting strobing shadows that twist into mocking shapes. Your boss's smile stretches wider, impossibly wide, splitting his face. "No excuses!" he booms, the sound shaking the walls. "The *stakes* are everything! Entire realities depend on your... formatting!"

You open your mouth to protest, to explain it's impossible, to beg for crayons because even a child's scribble seems more achievable than this cosmic task. But your voice comes out as a series of high-pitched, glitchy squeaks. The pixels on your monitor dissolve into static snow, forming fleeting images of collapsing galaxies and distraught表情less accountants.

The office walls begin to fade, turning into swirling nebulae. Your boss leans down, his breath smelling like burning circuit boards and impending doom. "Just... get... *something*... done," he whispers, his voice now a menacing mechanical drone. "Before... the... singularity... recalibrates."

You lunge for the keyboard, now just blobs of cooling plastic on the desk, your fingers sinking into useless goo. The deadline countdown on the screen flickers: **-00:00:01**. A universe-shattering rumble begins deep beneath your feet. You wake up with a gasp, heart hammering, the phantom taste of ozone and existential dread still on your tongue. Your alarm clock blares, sounding suspiciously like... fading static.
