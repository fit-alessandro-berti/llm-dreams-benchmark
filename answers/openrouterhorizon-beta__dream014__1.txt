and you let yourself be led, at first with suspicion, then with relief. Their voices are soft as rain on neon signs, their smiles like small lanterns in the fog. One offers you a cup of something warm that tastes like cinnamon and childhood summers. Another unfolds a paper map that somehow includes not just streets but memories—your own, sketched in watercolor. You point to a corner and it feels like pointing to a forgotten song.

They don’t ask you where you’re going. They ask what you hope to find once you arrive. You try to answer, but the words come out as birds, startled and honest, flying up into the night. The tallest stranger cups one in both hands and whispers to it, then releases it. It circles back to you, lands on your shoulder, and becomes a thought you hadn’t dared to think.

As you walk together, the city shifts. Billboards peel back to reveal the constellations they were pretending to be. Crosswalks play piano keys when your feet touch them, a melody in step with your breathing. The alleys are no longer narrow—they’re corridors of fragrant trees, their leaves printed with addresses of people who once loved you and might love you still. Windows open as you pass and exhale warmth across your cheeks. The traffic lights blink in the rhythm of your pulse: red when you want to hide, green when you remember your courage.

“Every city knows its travelers,” one stranger says, and their hand brushes your sleeve like a promise. “It doesn’t ask you to belong. It asks you to listen.” You tilt your head. Beneath the honking and chatter you hear it: a low, steady humming, like a kettle about to sing. The sound is familiar. You realize it’s the sound your name makes when you say it to yourself kindly.

They lead you through a market where fruit is stacked like little suns. You choose one, and when you bite it, you taste a place you’ve never been but somehow miss. Juice runs down your wrist; the smallest stranger catches it with a napkin and tucks the napkin into your pocket as though keeping proof that sweetness happened.

Finally, you arrive at a square you don’t recognize and yet have always known. In the center stands a fountain, but the water rises and falls in patterns that match your breath. The strangers stop. They don’t point. They don’t explain. They just look at you like people do when a story is about to finish itself.

You sit on the rim of the fountain and dangle your feet above the water. Your reflection looks up with steady eyes and, for once, does not waver when the surface trembles. The kind strangers step back into the crowd, their faces blurring into a hundred others, and you understand it was never about who they were but the way they held the map: like it was yours to read all along.

A breeze moves through the square, lifting hair, lifting worries, lifting the corners of the city like a carpet being shaken out. Somewhere a bell rings, or maybe it’s your heartbeat learning a new step. You stand, and you choose a direction—not because it’s right on the map, but because the birds inside your chest lean toward it, feathers bright, unafraid.

You take one step, then another. The fountain hums behind you. The streets open like a book. And wherever you go, the city walks beside you, not as a maze, but as a companion—signs translating themselves as you pass, doorways recognizing your knock, strangers meeting your gaze as though you are no longer lost but simply arriving.
