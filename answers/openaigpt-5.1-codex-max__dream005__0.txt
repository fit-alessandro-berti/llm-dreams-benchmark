each cluster seems to be its own little world. One circle is laughing uproariously at a joke told in a language you don't recognize; another is doing some kind of slow, synchronized dance, moving in time to music you can't hear. You try to ask, "Have you seen Sarah?" but your voice comes out like a whisper, and they smile politely and turn away.

The rooms melt into one another, ceilings stretching up into starry skies, hallways narrowing into winding garden paths. A group of elderly women knitting bright red scarves beckon you to sit, and when you decline you notice their yarn has no end, streaming off into darkness. A man in a blue suit offers you a glass that is always full no matter how much you sip. Every face looks almost like someone you know, but when you blink it changes.

You climb a staircase that becomes a ladder, then a tree, the sound of your friend's laugh echoing somewhere above you. You call out and this time your voice is clear. The crowd quiets, turns as one, and parts like a sea. There they are, in the center of the room, waving, but as you move toward them the floor becomes soft and you sink a little. You make one more effort, stretch out your hand, and just as your fingers brush theirs, the alarm clock chirps and you wake up, the echo of the gathering fading like mist.
