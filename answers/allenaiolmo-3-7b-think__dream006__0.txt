You step onto the stage, the spotlight warming your face as the crowd’s anticipation hums in the air. You begin to speak, your voice steady at first, but as you open your mouth to address them, the words twist into shimmering light that arcs above your head. The audience’s murmurs dissolve into a chorus of whispers, their faces dissolving into constellations that swirl around you—ancient galaxies, dying stars, and nebulae glowing with forgotten dreams. Suddenly, you’re not alone: the crowd has become the cosmos itself, their collective breath a gravitational pull tugging at your boots as the stage tilts, gravity softening. You rise, your voice now a river of stardust flowing through the crowd, each syllable birthing a flower that blooms into a bridge between their hearts and the infinite. The air crackles with a silent understanding—this speech was never about *them*. It was about you, finally finding your voice in the universe’s symphony.  

The room dissolves. You’re left floating in a sea of fireflies, their light spelling your name in the sky. Somewhere, a clock ticks backward, and the crowd’s laughter echoes as a child’s, as yours. You smile, and the dream ends with your shadow stretching into a wing, lifting you into a sun that’s already setting.  

*(The speech, it turns out, was a key. And you’d just unlocked the door to your own beginning.)*
