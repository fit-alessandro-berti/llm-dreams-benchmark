...realize that everything around you has shifted. The office is eerily quiet, and the fluorescent lights hum in the background, creating an unsettling atmosphere. You glance at the clock on the wall; it's already past the time you usually leave for the day. Your boss, Mr. Thompson, stands across from you, his expression unreadable, holding a stack of documents that look like they belong to another world—completely unrelated to anything you've worked on before.

"Got five minutes," he says, his voice calm but firm. "Start with this."

You take a deep breath, trying to shake off the surreal feeling. You know you can't ask for more time, so you nod and begin flipping through the papers. The first document looks like a blueprint for a space station, but instead of metal and circuits, it’s filled with intricate diagrams of neural pathways and quantum particles. The second one is a series of equations that defy any physics you’ve ever learned. 

You try to make sense of it, but every time you think you're getting somewhere, something else catches your eye—a cryptic message in a foreign language, a set of coordinates that don’t correspond to any known location, or a list of names that seem to be from a different era.

Suddenly, your phone buzzes in your pocket. It’s a text from your best friend: *What’s up with the weird vibes?*

You hesitate. Should you tell them? Would they even believe you? But then you realize that if you don’t respond, they might get suspicious. You type back: *Just a long day. Will explain later.*

Your boss clears his throat. "You have five minutes, remember?"

You sigh, knowing there’s no way you can possibly finish this in time. But as you continue flipping through the pages, something strange happens. The words on the documents start to shift, rearranging themselves into coherent sentences. The equations simplify, and the diagrams become clearer. You start to understand what’s being asked of you, and the more you work, the more confident you feel.

Before you know it, the five minutes are almost up. You hand the documents back to Mr. Thompson, who looks at them for a moment before nodding approvingly.

"Not bad," he says, handing you a small USB drive. "Take this home and finish it. I expect it on my desk by tomorrow morning."

You’re about to protest—how can you possibly finish this in one night? But before you can say anything, he’s already turned and walked away, leaving you alone in the now-empty office.

You exhale, feeling both relieved and overwhelmed. You stuff the USB drive into your pocket and head for the door, but just as you reach for the handle, you hear footsteps behind you. You turn to see your boss again, his face stern but not unkind.

"Good luck," he says quietly. "This isn’t just a project. It’s a challenge. Prove to me that you can rise to it."

With that, he walks out, leaving you standing there, staring at the door. You take one last look at the documents in your hand, feeling a mix of dread and determination. You’ve got one night to change everything—or prove that you’re just as lost as you feel.

And so, you begin.
