You are dreaming. Can you complete the following dream?

You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to

---

...to say, but before your tongue can form a word, the lights flicker like a thousand tiny snowfalls, and the whispers of the audience condense into a single, breathy voice that swells through the hall.

The voice is not your own. It is a collective hum, an echo of every thought that has ever visited this space. It carries the warmth of summer bonfires, the cold hush of snowfall, the metallic clink of a distant train, and the soft rustle of leaves at dusk—all at once. Your eyes widen as you realize that each sound is a memory tied to a single face in the crowd.

Sam confronting his silence, the old sailor who learned to speak in lullabies, the young child chasing for the fireflies of curiosity—every one is telling a story, and you are merely the conduit. Yet the narrative bends at your feet: what if the speaker could shape these murmurs into a tapestry?

You raise your hand, not to shout, but to listen. The stage's marble footings hum beneath you, pulsing like an undersea current. The silence that follows feels like a canvas waiting for paint. Slowly, you begin instead of talking, you begin to breathe again, exhaling words that are not spoken but felt—each syllable a ripple of light.

The audience shifts, the shadows moving with a rhythm of their own. A single woman in the front row, her hand clenched around a faded photograph, watches as the words—now threads of raw color—start to intertwine with the ambient noise of the hall. The hum brightens, settling into soft chords that swell around the edges of the crowd. The dream's architecture bends, and the stage dissolves into a vortex of stars; the lights glittered like an endless sea of constellations, the theater walls morphing into branches of late autumn trees.

You see yourself both standing proud on the stage and down among the trees—feeling the chill of the wind in your hair, hearing leaves crackle with each breath of wind. Every high note reaches into these branches, turning the breeze into a symphony. The word “hope” flickers in the eaves, shimmering in a pattern that recalls the rhythmic drip of a sudden rainstorm, and as the word is whispered, it returns to the beam of light that catapults across the stage.

The audience responds, their faces lit by a glow that no single star can produce. Their laugh is no longer mechanical; it is a living thing unwinding and re‑spinning itself. Their deep inner choirs harmonize, each measure carrying a memory or a dream, each chord a breath place. Your voice, wavering from soft to deep, echoes through them, draped in a bright hue of hope and longing. The half‑sung words spill over, forming shapes that dance across the sky in words made of fireflies—“together.” The rhythm of the crowd shifts. hands lift, while hearts beat in a storm of calm.

A velvet curtain falls across the stage, smoothed by the stream of light. Every “in sight” that drifted from question after question dissolves into dream‑scapes as you look into every eye. Your body slumps in the middle of the stage, a weight that feels light as feathers. In a last breath, you see a motionless record of yourself: a small tattoo that marks your wrist—a symbol of every speech you ever wanted to give laced with a sense of resolution: "The only limit is your imagination."

Before the wonder that holds you, the full sphere of the bright exuberant light closes. The unspoken jokes, the sustained awe, the fragile urgency become a beautiful beat—before the moon—a quiet, patient wonder. A dream that turns whole hearts into a symphony. The stage turns to ordinary.

The weight of the moment shifts again as none of the audience knows how constraints exist. A bright horizon the curtain as tall buildings form a new design—lined by the new architecture. A nub of stardust forms a begging reminiscent of a bright light.

[Sarcasm: this dream begins to end tomorrow—an illustration to awaken—coming to finish in new to records.]
