...strange symbols etched into its surface—like constellations forming a language you’ve never seen, yet somehow understand. Your fingers trace the grooves, and as they do, the metal begins to warm. The patterns start to shift, rearranging into what looks like a question: *“What are you most afraid to remember?”*

Your breath catches. The box doesn’t demand an answer out loud—no, it feels like it’s asking you to *feel* it, to bring the memory forward. You hesitate. The lid trembles slightly, as if pulsing with a heartbeat not your own.

And then—your hand, almost on its own, presses against the center symbol, now glowing faintly amber. A deep click echoes from within, but the box doesn’t open. Not yet.

It wants truth first.

Do you… remember what happened that summer by the lake? The one you’ve buried so deep even your dreams avoid it?

(What would you like to do?)
