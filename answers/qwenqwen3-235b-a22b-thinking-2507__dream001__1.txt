You start to **run, but your legs feel like they're moving through thick honey.** The city pulses around you — **buildings shift like living things**, their facades melting from glass towers into brick tenements, then into impossible, spiraling structures that hum with soft blue light. Neon signs flicker above you in **languages that rearrange themselves** as you try to read them: *"Rue des Ombres → 5th Ave → 小徑の終わり"*. None of it means anything.  

Your phone is heavy in your hand, but it’s **just a smooth river stone** — no signal, no maps, just cold, wet stone pressing into your palm. Panic claws up your throat. *An hour.* The meeting is *everything* — a job? A confession? A funeral? You can’t remember, but the **stakes feel like your entire future hinges on being there**.  

You spot a **vendor selling glowing paper birds**. "Directions?" you gasp, shoving imaginary coins at them. They smile, handing you a bird that flutters to life. It leads you down an alley that **stretches longer the faster you move**, past windows showing different eras: a 1920s speakeasy, a future city of floating gardens, a room full of ticking clocks frozen at 11:59.  

Suddenly, the bird **dives into a subway grate**. You leap after it — and tumble into a **train car with no seats, only mirrors**. Every reflection shows you *dressed differently*: in a tuxedo, a hazmat suit, pajamas covered in stars. The doors slide shut with a hiss. *Next stop: YOUR DESTINATION?* But the train **doesn’t move**. Instead, the windows go black, and a voice whispers through the static:  

> *"The meeting is here. You’re late because you’re looking for a door."*  

You spin around. The only other passenger is a **pigeon wearing a tiny top hat**, pecking at a puddle on the floor that reflects not the train... but a **sunlit conference room**. Your colleagues sit waiting, sipping coffee. The clock on the wall reads **9:00 AM — your meeting started ten minutes ago.**  

You lunge for the puddle — but your hand passes through cold water. The pigeon coos: *"Knock first."*  

You realize you’re standing before a **door made of shadow** in the mirror wall. No handle, no sign. You raise your fist just as the city’s sirens begin to wail...  

...and you **jolt awake in your bed**, heart pounding. Sunlight streams through your window. *6:30 AM.* Your *real* meeting isn’t for hours.  
But on your nightstand, a single, damp **feather** rests on a crumpled map of a city you’ve never seen — written in the corner in your own handwriting:  
**"Knock where there is no door."**  

You’ll spend the whole day wondering if your coffee tasted like rain. ☕️
