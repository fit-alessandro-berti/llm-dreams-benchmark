walk around, looking for signs or people who can help. The streets are crowded, but everyone seems to be in a hurry, hardly noticing me. I try asking a few passersby for directions, but they either don't pay attention or give vague answers. I feel increasingly anxious as time ticks away.

Suddenly, I spot a map stand near a park. Maybe I can find the location of the meeting there. I rush over and examine the map carefully. The city is full of winding streets and alleys, making it confusing to navigate. I try to trace my path from where I am to the address of the meeting, but I get tangled up in the grid of lines.

Just then, a kind-looking elderly man approaches me. He asks if I need help, noticing my distress. I explain my situation, and he nods understandingly. He offers to guide me to the meeting place, saying it's not far from here. Relieved, I follow him through the bustling streets.

We walk in silence for a while, and I appreciate his company. The city starts to look familiar as we move along, and I realize that maybe I was overreacting earlier. perhaps with a little help, I can manage.

As we get closer to the destination, the man points out landmark after landmark, helping me orient myself. He shares stories about the history of the buildings and the significance of certain places. I listen intently, fascinated by the rich culture and architecture around me.

Finally, we arrive at a beautiful embassy building. It's grand and elegant, surrounded by well-manicured gardens. I check my watch and see that I've made it just in time. I thank the elderly man profusely for his assistance and offer to buy him coffee or lunch as a token of appreciation. He declines graciously, saying that helping others is its own reward.

As I enter the embassy, I feel a sense of accomplishment mixed with gratitude. The dream ends with me stepping into the meeting room, ready to begin.
