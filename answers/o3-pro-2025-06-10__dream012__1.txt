…plant your boots against the groaning deck, raise your speaking-trumpet, and bellow through the rain:

“Reef the topsails! Lash every line you can find—she’ll hold if we do!”

Your voice slices through thunder like a blade. The crew leaps to the rigging, silhouettes jerking against sheets of violet lightning. Yet even as they obey, the sea rises higher, grey walls of water clawing at the bulwarks.

A sudden hush falls. Time seems to pause, the way it sometimes does in dreams. The storm clouds part just enough for a single shaft of moonlight to strike the water ahead. In that silvery corridor you glimpse something impossible—an ancient stone archway standing upright upon the waves, draped in seaweed, its keystone carved with unfamiliar stars.

Every compass on board spins madly. Instinct screams turn away, but another voice—one that feels older than you—whispers, Go through.

“Hard to starboard!” you shout. Spray needles your face as the helm swings. The ship lurches, but the waves flatten in a sudden eerie calm as you line up with the arch. Behind you, wind still howls; ahead, the sea glimmers like polished glass.

The moment your prow passes beneath the arch, the world inverts. Masts become roots, sails become leaves, and the deck transforms into the underside of a vast, upside-down forest canopy. Your crew dangles from glowing vines instead of rigging, laughing like children who’ve forgotten the word for fear.

You alone remain upright on the tilted deck, heart hammering. A figure steps from between two twisting trunks—it is you, only older, eyes bright with storms survived and storms yet to come. The elder captain offers a compass of crystal that points nowhere and everywhere at once.

“Remember,” they say, voice mingling with surf and wind, “leadership isn’t steering from certainty but from curiosity. When the map ends, let wonder be the helm.”

You take the compass. It is warm as sunrise. The forest ripples, collapses into starlight, and you are back on your ship, but the storm has vanished. Dawn paints the horizon in rose and gold, the sea as calm as a held breath. Your crew, wide-eyed and drenched, look to you not just for orders now, but for the story of where you’ve been.

You smile, raise the crystal compass to the light, and feel the ship surge forward—not merely across water, but into every untold possibility awaiting beyond the edge of waking.
