...you notice something strange about them—their eyes gleam with an otherworldly light, and their smiles seem to ripple like reflections on water. One of them presses a small, glowing map into your palm, whispering, *"Follow the echoes, not the streets."*

As you unfold the map, the city around you shifts. The buildings stretch and warp, their edges blurring into swirling colors. The strangers dissolve into the crowd, leaving only faint laughter in their wake. The map in your hands now shows streets that don’t exist—alleys that twist into impossible shapes.

Then, a voice calls from behind you. Turning, you see a figure with no face, wearing a coat made of shifting shadows. They extend a hand and say, *"You’ve always been lost, haven’t you? But you’re exactly where you’re meant to be."*

A gust of wind carries the map away, and suddenly, you’re standing on a bridge over a river of stars. The city lights flicker like distant constellations, and you realize—*you’ve been here before.* Not in waking life, but deep in dreams you’ve forgotten.

Before you can speak, the figure whispers, *"Wake up now. Or keep going."*

And then—

*(How would you like the dream to end? Do you wake up, or do you step onto the bridge?)*
