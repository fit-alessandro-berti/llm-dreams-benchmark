**Dream Completion:**

As you begin to speak, your voice suddenly falters—not from fear, but from something stranger. The words you intended to say twist in the air, forming shapes instead of sentences. The audience gasps as letters dissolve into floating symbols, swirling like constellations before rearranging themselves into a single, towering word: **"Remember."**

A hush falls over the crowd, but you don’t panic. Instead, you reach out and pluck a single letter from the floating mess. It hums in your palm, warm and alive. The moment it touches your skin, memories flood in—not yours, but memories of strangers: a child’s laughter, a soldier’s last letter, a scientist’s forgotten equation. The crowd is now a sea of faces, each reflecting a different life’s fragments.

Then, the stage tilts. The audience rises as one, their bodies dissolving into threads of light that weave into the sky. The word **"Remember"** expands, swallowing the room, and you realize this isn’t a speech—it’s a test. A voice, neither human nor machine, echoes:

*"Will you carry these stories, or let them fade?"*

You wake with a start, your heart pounding—but not from fear. From the weight of the question still unanswered.
