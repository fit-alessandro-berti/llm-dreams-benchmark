You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are all written in ancient hieroglyphics, glowing faintly like fireflies trapped in the paper. Panic rises, but then the proctor—a towering owl with spectacles perched on its beak—leans in and whispers, "Translate with your heart, not your eyes."

The first question: a swirling symbol of a snake devouring its tail. You realize it's asking, *What eternal cycle must you break to claim your destiny?* Your pen hovers, ink dripping like liquid starlight, as the room warps—desks floating, classmates morphing into shadows of your past selves.

Suddenly, the paper ripples, revealing a hidden layer: *Draw the impossible machine that powers forgotten dreams.* Your hand moves on its own, sketching gears of cloud and bone, fueled by whispers from the walls. The owl nods approvingly, but time fractures—clocks melt into hourglasses of sand that tastes like regret.

As the final question emerges—a blank void pulsing with your own reflection—you understand: there is no exam. You've been grading yourself all along. The room dissolves into dawn light, and you wake, pencil still clutched in your fist, the future unwritten.
