Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you notice each wears a small, glowing symbol around their neck—a compass, a lantern, a key, and a map. They speak without words, their voices like wind chimes, guiding you down a narrow alley that hadn’t existed moments ago. The city’s chaos softens into a symphony of murmurs as they lead you through a hidden archway veiled in ivy. Beyond it, a garden blooms under a violet sky, trees humming with bioluminescent fruit. One stranger hands you a compass that points not north, but toward a glowing door at the garden’s heart. Another presses a lantern into your hands, its light warm as honey. As you step toward the door, the key around the last stranger’s neck detaches and floats to your palm, humming in tune with your heartbeat. The door creaks open, revealing not an exit, but a mirror—your reflection smiling, holding a map scribbled with constellations. You realize you’ve been here all along. The strangers fade into fireflies, and you wake up in your bed, the scent of night-blooming jasmine lingering on your pillow.
