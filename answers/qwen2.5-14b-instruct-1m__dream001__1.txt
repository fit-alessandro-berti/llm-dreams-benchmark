wander through the bustling streets, feeling a mix of anxiety and curiosity. The city is alive with the hum of people going about their business—vendors shouting out deals, children laughing as they chase each other between buildings, and the soft glow of streetlights beginning to illuminate the evening sky. 

You pull out your phone, but there’s no signal—no maps, no contacts, nothing. Panic starts to rise, but you remind yourself to stay calm. You notice the architecture around you is a blend of futuristic and vintage, with towering skyscrapers made of glass and steel standing next to quaint, cobblestone alleyways lined with old-world shops. 

As you walk, you pass by a small café with a sign that reads "The Last Page." Curious, you step inside. Inside, the place is cozy, filled with the scent of freshly brewed coffee and the soft murmur of conversation. A man sitting by the window catches your eye. He’s reading a thick, leather-bound book, his glasses perched on the edge of his nose. Something about him feels familiar, though you can’t quite place why.

You approach the counter, where a woman with long, flowing hair and a warm smile hands you a steaming cup of coffee. “You look lost,” she says, her voice gentle. “Where are you headed?”

You hesitate, unsure how to explain the urgency of your situation. But something about her demeanor makes you feel safe. “I’m supposed to be at a meeting,” you say, glancing at your watch. “But I don’t know where it is.”

She nods thoughtfully, then gestures for you to follow her to a corner table. She pulls out a piece of paper and writes down an address. “This is where you need to go,” she says, her voice tinged with a hint of mystery. “But be careful. This city isn’t what it seems.”

Before you can ask what she means, she disappears into the kitchen, leaving you with the note. You glance at the address—it’s in a part of the city you haven’t seen yet, far from where you are now. The streets ahead seem darker, more shadowy, but you have no choice. You thank her and leave the café, the warmth of the coffee still in your hand.

As you head toward the address, the city begins to shift around you. The lights dim, and the sounds of the city fade into eerie silence. You start to hear whispers—soft, almost imperceptible, but growing louder with every step. They’re voices, but not human. They seem to come from the very air itself, guiding you, or perhaps leading you astray.

You arrive at a grand, old building, its doors ornately carved and imposing. Inside, the lobby is empty, save for a single figure sitting behind a desk. It’s the man from the café, his eyes now cold and distant. He looks up at you, and without a word, hands you a key.

“Go upstairs,” he says, his voice low and urgent. “The meeting is waiting.”

You take the key, your heart pounding. As you ascend the staircase, the whispers grow louder, more insistent. When you reach the top floor, you find a large, circular room with a single door at the center. Behind it, you sense the presence of someone—or something—waiting for you.

You pause, the key trembling in your hand. What lies beyond that door? Will it be the meeting you’ve been searching for, or something far more dangerous?

With a deep breath, you turn the key and push the door open.
