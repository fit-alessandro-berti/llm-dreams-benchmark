As you examine the box’s intricate patterns, the designs shift in a subtle glow, revealing a network of interwoven symbols that pulse like a heartbeat. Each curve and line radiates an energy that defies physics—some resemble stars, others curves into the shape of a clock, and some whisper secrets through the walls. You realize the patterns are alive, shifting as if responding to your thoughts. You trace them, and the room itself feels smaller, more alive. The door behind the box hesitates, waiting for a choice. But the dream is a symphony, and you feel a silent language within the patterns, one that will guide you into the next phase.
