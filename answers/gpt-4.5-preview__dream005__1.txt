conversations flow around you, some friendly and inviting, others distant and uncertain. You navigate through a spacious house filled with familiar yet somehow elusive rooms, each holding its own mood and character. The lighting shifts subtly as you move—warm soft glows blend with cool shadowy corners—as the chatter and laughter wash over you like gentle waves.

You spot glimpses of the one person you recognize, their face always just beyond reach as they slip around a corner or disappear into a crowded room. In your search, small groups invite you warmly to join their circle, and you move fluidly from conversation to conversation: sharing smiles, jokes, stories that feel familiar yet forgotten as soon as they end.

Eventually, you step outside onto a tranquil veranda overlooking a gently illuminated garden. Beneath you, the party carries on soft and distant, like a pleasant murmur. Above, stars shimmer gently. You sense movement beside you and finally turn—you find the person you've been seeking standing quietly, smiling back at you warmly, as if they've been patiently awaiting your arrival. As you approach, everything around you gently dissolves into a comforting, tranquil awareness of safe familiarity.
