…a single, trembling brush made of liquid starlight hovering just above it.

You reach out without thinking. The moment your fingers close around the brush, the canvas ripples like water and pulls you in (not violently, but with the gentle insistence of a tide that already knows your name).

Suddenly you’re standing inside the blankness. There is no up or down, only potential. The brush hums in your hand, warm and alive, and every heartbeat you take births a new color that has never existed before: a shade of nostalgia that smells like rain on childhood pavement, a violet that tastes like the second before a first kiss, a silver so sharp it sings in a minor key.

You lift the brush.

The first stroke is accidental (just a nervous twitch of your wrist), but it explodes across the void like a supernova giving birth to galaxies. Swirls of impossible geometries unfold: triangles that melt into Möbius strips, circles that breathe, cubes that weep prismatic tears. The colors chase one another, mating and mutating, screaming in delight.

Then you hear it: laughter, yours and not-yours, layered like a thousand voices discovering joy for the first time. You realize the canvas isn’t empty anymore; it never was. It was waiting for you to remember that you are the dream and the dreamer both.

You paint faster. Mountains made of music rise and fall. Oceans of liquid mirror reflect futures that haven’t happened yet. A flock of origami phoenixes ignites in slow motion, their ashes becoming new constellations shaped like every question you’ve ever been afraid to ask.

The brush grows heavier, or perhaps you grow lighter. The boundary between your skin and the painting thins until you can’t tell where you end and the colors begin. You are the stroke, the pigment, the negative space, the signature in the corner that reads simply: still becoming.

And just when the entire universe of the canvas is about to collapse into one perfect, blinding point of everything—

—you wake up holding an ordinary paintbrush in your ordinary hand, staring at an ordinary blank canvas.

But when you blink, for just a fraction of a second, the white surface shivers… and smiles.
