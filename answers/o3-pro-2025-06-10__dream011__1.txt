…written in a language you don’t recognize—at least, not at first. The symbols look like constellations stitched together with strands of silver thread. When you lean closer, they rearrange themselves into familiar shapes: the outline of your childhood home, the spiral of your favorite shell, the jagged skyline of a city you’ve never visited but somehow miss.

Your pencil has become a fountain pen that drips ink the color of midnight. You glance around the lecture hall for help, yet every seat is occupied by someone you used to be: the version of you who loved dinosaurs in second grade, the teenager who played guitar until her fingertips bled, the intern who reheated coffee to stay awake. They’re all hunched over their own exams, writing fervently, refusing to look up.

The proctor clears her throat—a sound like pages turning in a library—and announces that time moves faster for anyone who hesitates. Instantly, the clock sprints; its hands whirl so quickly they blur into a circle.

Panicked, you look back at the paper. The first question has shifted again:

1. Define yourself without using words.

You place the pen to the page, and instead of ink, it releases the scent of rain on asphalt. The symbols absorb the smell, shimmer, and solidify into a photograph of you standing in a downpour, laughing. The question check-marks itself.

2. List everything you’ve lost that made you lighter.

Images bubble up and float off the sheet: old report cards, a box of mismatched socks, the ability to pretend you weren’t afraid of the dark. Each item drifts upward like a paper lantern and disappears into the ceiling.

3. Solve for X, where X is the door you’ve been avoiding.

The classroom walls peel away, revealing a hallway lined with doors. One glows faintly—its number matches the tattoo you almost got but never did. You step through.

Now you’re in a small garden at dusk. Fireflies sketch formulas in the air, each flash a fragment of proof that something beautiful survives every equation. A single chair sits beside a pond, and on the chair rests an envelope labeled Final Answer. Inside, a mirror reflects your face, but just for a moment; then it shows the faces of everyone who ever encouraged you.

You realize the exam was never about right or wrong, only about remembering what matters when everything feels at stake. As acceptance floods through you, the garden lights dim, and the smell of rain returns.

A bell rings—soft, distant, like it’s underwater—and you wake up, heart calm, knowing the results have already been written in a language you finally understand.
