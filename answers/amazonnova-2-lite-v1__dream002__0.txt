### **You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and…**

…the air shifts from warm and fragrant to cold and charged. The once gentle breeze becomes a restless whisper through the trees, carrying with it the scent of distant lightning. Leaves swirl around your feet, and the sunlight filtering through the canopy darkens to a bruised gray. You pause, listening — the forest no longer hums with birdsong, but falls into an eerie silence, as if nature itself is holding its breath.

Then, without warning, the first fat drops of rain begin to fall, splattering against the mossy ground. You glance up — the sky has turned an unnatural green-black, and storm clouds boil overhead, churning like a living thing. Thunder rumbles, low and deep, vibrating through the earth beneath you. You feel a flicker of anxiety — you are far from shelter.

You spot a faint trail leading off the main path and decide to follow it, hoping it might lead to a cave or old ranger’s hut. As you hurry forward, the rain intensifies, soaking your clothes and turning the trail to mud. Branches lash at your face, and the forest seems to close in around you. Strange lights flicker between the trees — reflections of the storm, or something else?

Then, just as you begin to wonder if you’ve taken a wrong turn, you hear it: a low, rhythmic sound, not thunder — something older, deeper. The ground begins to tremble beneath your feet. You stop, heart pounding, and look around. The trees themselves seem to sway in unison, their leaves rustling with purpose. A chill runs down your spine as you realize the storm isn’t just weather — it’s awakening something.

A flash of lightning reveals a figure standing at the edge of the clearing ahead — tall, shadowed, with eyes that gleam like embers in the dark. You feel an instinctual pull to approach, though every instinct screams to run. As the wind howls louder, the figure raises a hand, and the storm seems to answer — lightning strikes the ground at its feet, forming a circle of fire.

You stand at the edge of the glow, heart hammering, as the voice of the figure reaches you, carried by the wind — not spoken, but felt, like a memory you never lived:

> “You have walked the path of the unwary. The forest remembers you. And now, so does the storm.”

You have three choices:

1. **Step into the circle of fire** — to face whatever the storm brings and uncover its purpose.
2. **Run back the way you came**, risking the fury of the tempest and whatever may hunted in the dark.
3. **Call out**, asking the figure for mercy or explanation — hoping it is more than a manifestation of the storm.

Which will you choose?
