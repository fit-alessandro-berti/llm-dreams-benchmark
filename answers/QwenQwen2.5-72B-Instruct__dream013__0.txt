You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, you realize that the challenges are getting progressively harder. The walls are lined with ancient carvings and symbols that seem to hint at the nature of the puzzles ahead.

After solving a particularly intricate puzzle involving a series of moving mirrors and hidden switches, you push open a heavy stone door and enter a vast chamber. The room is dimly lit by flickering torches, and in the center, there stands a grand sundial with intricate gears and a celestial map etched into its base.

As you approach the sundial, you notice that the mechanism is broken, and a series of levers and dials are scattered around it. A voice, seemingly coming from the sundial itself, speaks to you in a mysterious language, but you can understand its meaning:

"To proceed, you must align the celestial bodies with the positions they held on the day this maze was created. Only then will the path forward be revealed."

You examine the sundial more closely and notice that the gears can be adjusted, and the levers control the movement of the celestial bodies depicted on the map. You recall a piece of parchment you found earlier in the maze, which contains a series of coordinates and dates. You match the dates to the sundial's markings and begin to adjust the gears and levers accordingly.

As you make the final adjustment, the sundial emits a soft, golden light, and the walls of the chamber start to tremble. Suddenly, a section of the wall slides open, revealing a hidden passage. The voice speaks again, this time in a more welcoming tone:

"Well done, seeker of truth. The way ahead lies through this passage. But beware, the challenges that await are as deep as the mysteries of the universe itself."

You take a deep breath and step into the hidden passage, ready to face whatever lies ahead. The maze continues to unravel its secrets, and you are more determined than ever to uncover its hidden meaning.
