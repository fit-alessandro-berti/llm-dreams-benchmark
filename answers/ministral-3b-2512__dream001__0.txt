**The Dream Continues:**

You take a deep breath and pull your phone out—only to realize it’s dead. No maps, no GPS, no way to track your location. The city’s streets stretch endlessly, lined with towering, shifting buildings that seem to breathe as you walk past them. Some structures flicker like dying lanterns, while others loom too tall, their windows reflecting distorted versions of yourself.

A sudden *click* echoes from the air—your phone’s screen suddenly glows with a single, cryptic message:

**"The meeting is where the last light fades."**

You glance around. The sky is a bruised purple, streaked with streaks of gold that pulse like veins. A crowd of strangers—some with hollow eyes, others with too many limbs—moves in unison toward a distant, jagged spire. A sign on it reads: **"HOURS: 00:59:47."**

A voice, neither male nor female, whispers in your mind: *"You’re not late. You’re just… here."*

Then, the ground trembles. The buildings groan as if waking from a long sleep. A massive, skeletal hand emerges from the pavement, gripping the air. The crowd parts, revealing a door—no, a *mouth*—set into the stone. Inside, the air smells of ozone and something sweet, like burnt sugar.

A figure steps forward—tall, pale, with eyes like polished river stones. They hold a single, glowing orb in their palm. "You’ve been chosen," they say. "The meeting isn’t about time. It’s about *what you carry*."

You realize, with a jolt, that the orb is your own reflection—your face, but distorted, as if seen through a mirror that’s been cracked for centuries. The orb flickers, and suddenly, you *know* the answer.

But the door is closing.

**What do you do?**

*(Do you step inside? Ask questions? Or do something else entirely?)*
