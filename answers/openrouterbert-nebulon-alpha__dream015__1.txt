**The Last Garden**

You wake to the scent of damp earth and rust. The air is thick with the weight of survival, the sky a bruised canvas of purples and grays, streaked with the smoke of distant fires. Your shelter—a crumbling concrete bunker, its walls patched with scavenged metal and plastic—groans under the wind. Outside, the world is a graveyard of civilization: skeletal buildings claw at the horizon, their windows like hollow eyes, and the streets are choked with the husks of abandoned vehicles, their tires long since rotted away.

But you’re not alone.

A child’s voice cuts through the silence. *"You said you’d show me today."*

You turn to see **Lena**, no older than ten, her dark hair matted with dust, her small hands clutching a chipped ceramic pot. She’s been with you for three months now, ever since you found her curled in the ruins of a grocery store, her parents gone, her voice raw from screaming. You didn’t plan to keep her. But the world had other ideas.

*"I did,"* you say, forcing a smile. *"But we have to be quick. The scavengers will be out soon."*

You grab your pack—a tattered thing, its straps reinforced with wire—and a rusted shovel. The two of you step into the wasteland, sticking to the shadows of the ruins. The ground is littered with the detritus of the old world: broken screens, melted plastic, the occasional bone. You’ve learned to read the land like a map. The scavengers avoid the **Rot Zones**, where the earth still bubbles with toxic sludge from the old chemical plants. The raiders stick to the highways, where the last of the fuel can be siphoned from wrecks. And the **Silent Ones**—the ones who never speak, who move in packs like wolves—you avoid them entirely.

Lena tugs your sleeve. *"What if we don’t find anything?"*

*"We will,"* you lie.

You’re heading for the **Old Botanical Gardens**, a place you’ve only heard whispers about. A greenhouse, they say, still standing. Still *growing*. If the stories are true, it’s the last place on Earth where seeds still sprout without mutation. Where tomatoes still taste like tomatoes, not like ash.

The journey takes hours. You pass a group of scavengers arguing over a can of peaches, their knives glinting in the dim light. You duck behind a collapsed wall, holding your breath until they move on. Lena’s fingers dig into your arm. *"They’re bad people,"* she whispers.

*"Not all of them,"* you murmur. *"But enough."*

By the time you reach the gardens, the sun is a dying ember on the horizon. The greenhouse looms ahead, its glass panels cracked but intact, vines creeping up the sides like desperate fingers. The door is sealed with a rusted padlock. You pry it open with the shovel, the metal shrieking in protest.

Inside, the air is thick with the scent of green things. **Life.**

Rows of plants stretch before you—tomatoes, beans, even a few struggling strawberry vines. A single, perfect lemon hangs from a tree in the corner. Lena gasps, her eyes wide. *"It’s real."*

You move quickly, filling your pack with seeds, cutting samples of the healthiest plants. You don’t know how long this place has been hidden, but you know it won’t stay that way. Someone else will find it. Someone worse.

As you work, you notice something strange. In the center of the greenhouse, half-buried in the soil, is a **metal box**. It’s old, its surface etched with symbols you don’t recognize. You dig it out, your hands trembling. Inside, wrapped in oilcloth, is a **book**—*The Complete Guide to Heirloom Gardening*—and beneath it, a **map**.

The map shows a network of greenhouses, all connected by underground tunnels. A **seed vault**, hidden beneath the ruins of an old university. A place where the last of the world’s food might still be growing.

Lena tugs your sleeve again. *"What is it?"*

You don’t answer. Because outside, beyond the greenhouse, you hear the **howl** of engines. The raiders have found you.

You grab Lena’s hand. *"Run."*

And as the first gunshot shatters the glass above you, you realize—this isn’t just about survival anymore.

It’s about **hope**.

**What do you do?**
- **Fight your way out** (grab a weapon, use the greenhouse as cover, try to take down the raiders).
- **Escape through the tunnels** (follow the map, risk the unknown dangers below).
- **Surrender** (maybe they’ll spare Lena if you give them the greenhouse).
- **Something else?** (Your call—this is *your* dream.)
