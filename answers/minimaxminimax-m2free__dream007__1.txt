I dreamed this, too. You decide to—

- Take a breath and say, “Let’s go outside for a minute,” and you walk into cool air while the argument thins to a hush around you.
- Put your hand on the table and admit the thing you’ve been hiding: the fear, the doubt, the mistake—and your friend’s eyes soften, half furious, half relieved.
- Silence the room with, “What do we both still need that we don’t have yet?” and together you list needs as if they were objects to be placed in a room.
- Circle back to the very first moment you became friends; you tell that story like a secret, and the fight dissolves into a sigh.
- Choose not to win: you drop the points you’ve been winning with and ask what would make the truth feel safer for both of you.
- Put the fight to a test: “If we each wrote a plan, what would it say?” and read them aloud until one line nods the other into a compromise.
- Stand in the doorway and say, “I’m not leaving this room,” and your friend closes the door, and now you both face the quiet inside.
- Hold your ground and let the anger move like weather—first thunder, then rain—until the world smells clean and you can say, “Now what?”
