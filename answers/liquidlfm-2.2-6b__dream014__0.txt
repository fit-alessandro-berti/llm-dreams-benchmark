You sigh, letting the weight of silence settle on you as the hum of the city fades just enough to reveal the faces before you—not just words, but genuine smiles and laughter that cut through the emptiness around you. A woman in a colorful scarf hands you a folded map that glows faintly, details shifting like light on water. A grizzled musician with a magnetic presence stands beside her, playing a soft melody on a violin. A boy with a pigeon on his shoulder looks up at you with wide eyes and says, *“Follow the stars.”*  

Then I realize — the strangers aren’t just guiding me through the streets, they’re reading my longing. One drops a pamphlet with maps of hidden gardens; another offers a warm, steaming cup of tea from a market stall nearby. A street artist with a quirky accent pulls a sidewalk chalkboard and writes your name in flowing letters: *“Home isn’t a place. It’s found.”*  

As dawn softens the city outside, you hear a voice—your own—quiet and steady. *“The path is always there, waiting to be walked.”* The strangers fade into the morning light, but the guide in your chest has shifted. You begin to see not just landmarks, but connections: a chance encounter here, a smile there, a story shared aloud.  

You don’t need to be lost anymore.  

The dream lingers on—bright, hopeful, and quietly brave.
