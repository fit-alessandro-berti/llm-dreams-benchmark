You are dreaming. You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to...

...not say the sharp retort building on your tongue. Instead, you decide to focus, not on their angry words, but on the space *between* you. The air feels thick, charged with frustration and hurt. You decide to *see* the argument, not just hear it.

As you focus, the swirling emotions and sharp words seem to take on a physical form. The air between you shimmers, then darkens, coalescing into a swirling, tangible cloud of grey and red mist, crackling with energy. It hums with the intensity of your disagreement, a visible, vibrating entity born from your conflict.

Your friend's voice trails off as they too stare, wide-eyed, at the impossible thing hovering between you. The cloud pulses, radiating waves of anxiety and anger.

You decide to reach out and touch it.

Your fingers sink into the cloud. It's not cold or hot, but feels like static and tangled string, vibrating against your skin. As you touch it, the humming intensifies, and the edges of the room you were in begin to waver and dissolve like old film.

The floor beneath you softens and gives way. You and your friend are suddenly falling, tumbling slowly through an endless expanse of grey mist that smells faintly of ozone and regret. The cloud you touched seems to have swallowed you whole, transporting you into the heart of the disagreement itself. Fragments of your argument echo around you like disembodied whispers, distorted and overlapping, making it impossible to tell who said what.

You look at your friend, floating near you in the mist. Their expression is no longer angry, but bewildered and a little frightened. The heated argument is forgotten, replaced by the shared, surreal reality of being trapped inside the storm of your own making. You wonder if you can ever find your way out, or if this is where arguments truly end – not in resolution, but in a shared, disorienting void.
