You start to feel that particular dream-panic rising in your chest — the kind that has no clean edges, that spreads like ink in water.

You pat your pockets. Phone. You have your phone. But when you unlock it, the screen shows a map that keeps *rearranging itself* — streets bending, folding, the city reorganizing its own geography every few seconds like it's breathing. The meeting location is listed as **"The Building You Already Know."**

That's the address. Exactly that.

You look up. The city is extraordinary — towers made of what looks like stacked libraries, balconies overflowing with plants that move slightly too deliberately to be wind. The people on the street walk with purpose but their faces are just slightly *turned away* whenever you try to focus on them.

You stop a woman in a yellow coat.

*"Excuse me — do you know where—"*

She turns and her face is kind, perfectly ordinary, and she says: *"You've been there before. That's the whole point."*

Then she's gone. Not walking away. Just — gone.

You start walking because standing still feels dangerous in the way only dream-standing-still feels dangerous. The clock somewhere behind your sternum says *forty minutes now.* You can feel time in your body rather than see it.

The street slopes downward and the architecture shifts — less glass, more stone, older, familiar in a way you can't source. Like a memory of a place you've only seen in photographs. And then —

A smell. Coffee and woodsmoke and something like rain on warm pavement.

And you *know* the smell.

You follow it around a corner and there's a building — completely unremarkable, four stories, green door — and you know with that absolute, irrational, dream-certain knowledge that *this is it.* You've never seen it. You've always known it.

You push through the green door.

Inside, the lobby is quiet. A man at a desk looks up and says, without you giving your name:

*"They're ready for you. Though—"* he pauses, tilting his head, *"—you should know that the meeting isn't about what you think it's about."*

*"What's it about?"* you ask.

He smiles the way people smile when the answer is obvious.

*"It's about the fact that you found it,"* he says. *"That's always what it's about."*

The elevator opens behind you. Inside, there is no panel of buttons. Just one floor. Just going up.

You step in.

The doors close.

And just before the dream shifts — before it dissolves into something else the way dreams do, bleeding at the edges — you feel something you don't expect:

Not panic.

Not relief, exactly.

Something quieter. The feeling of having been *looked for* and *found at the same time.*

The elevator rises.

You wake up —

*one floor short of whatever was waiting.*
