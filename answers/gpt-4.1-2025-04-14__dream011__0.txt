…written in a language you don’t recognize. The letters twist and dance across the page, forming shapes that remind you of childhood memories and half-forgotten melodies. Panic rises in your chest, but as you look closer, the lines between the questions blur. Your hand reaches for a pen, but it transforms into a paintbrush.

You realize you are being asked to **paint your answers** rather than write them. Around you, your classmates are calmly creating beautiful, swirling landscapes and vivid portraits where their exam papers had been. Suddenly, your exam paper expands, growing beyond the confines of the desk—unfurling like a scroll—inviting you to step onto it.

You rise and step forward, sinking ankle-deep into the exam page, painting your answers with your footsteps. Each step leaves behind bright colors and patterns, some from your dreams and others from places you’ve never visited. As you move, you understand that here, creativity is valued over memorization—imagination is the only “correct” answer.

An instructor appears, not to grade you, but to gently remind you:  
*“No two journeys are the same. Trust the colors beneath your feet.”*

You look up and see a door at the edge of your page—your future career is on the other side. Smiling, you run toward it, your exam blossoming into a vibrant tapestry behind you, a record of your unique dream.
