You are about to give a speeeacch... to a large audieeeeen, and as you steppped onto the staagggee, you see the crowdd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to… **feel the rain. Thick, impossile rain. It wasn’t just water; shards of amethyst and ruby streaked through it, cool and humming with a low thrumming sound. Everyone, faces gleaming with an impossible brightness, slowly started collecting drops, their fingers widening to cupping shapes. The audience didn't gasp or frown, just... gently opened their hands, offering the gemstone rain to you. As you rose to speak, your words dissolved into iridescent mist, mixing with the falling gems, creating constellations projected onto the velvet draperies. No one was talking, no one was watching – they were simply *receiving*. Suddenly a booming, synthesized voice echoed, not *outwards*, but *directly into a tiny, glittering channel just behind your ear: “Thank you for remembering the song."**

Then, the stage tilted sharply sideways.  And I saw, beneath the dazzling, gem-drenched rain, an immense field of sunflowers, each taller than a house, swaying mechanically… to a tune I knew was incredibly sad, though I couldn’t quite place it. They were all facing away from me. I took a step... and the whole world seemed to crumble like sugar into gelatin, losing focus like a projected film flickering.
