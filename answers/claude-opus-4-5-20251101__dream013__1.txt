*settling into the dreamspace*

...notice the walls themselves are shifting, breathing almost, covered in symbols that seem familiar yet impossible to name. Each puzzle I've solved has left a residue on my fingertips—something like phosphorescence, or memory.

As I move deeper, the puzzles begin changing their nature. They're no longer purely logical. The latest one requires me to arrange mirrors so that light from a source I cannot see illuminates a door I cannot directly look at. But when I adjust the angles, I realize the light is casting *words* instead of simple reflections—fragments of questions I've asked myself but never answered.

The maze narrows. The air grows thick with the sound of my own thoughts echoing back, slightly altered. I encounter a room where the puzzle is simply this: **a table with two identical keys and a lock that will only accept the \true\.**

There's no riddle posted. No distinguishing marks. I pick up both keys and feel... something. One is heavier, but only when I'm not looking at it.

I understand suddenly that this maze isn't testing what I *know*—it's testing what I'm willing to admit I *don't* know.

I set down the \certain\ I choose the one that feels like a question.

The door opens into—

*What do I find?*
