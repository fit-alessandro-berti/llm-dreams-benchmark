You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and faint glowing runes etched into its surface, pulsing like a heartbeat in the dim light of your dreamscape. The air grows thick with an otherworldly hum, and the box warms under your fingers, whispering secrets in a language you almost understand.

Curiosity overrides caution—you trace the runes, and they ignite in a cascade of emerald light. The box clicks open with a sigh, revealing not treasure, but a swirling vortex of memories: fragments of forgotten lives, laughter from childhood beaches, the sting of lost loves, and glimpses of futures yet unlived. You reach in, and the vortex pulls you deeper, dissolving the boundaries of self.

Suddenly, the dream fractures. You're falling through stars, the box now weightless in your hand, chasing you across endless skies. You wake with a jolt, the echo of its hum lingering in your chest—wondering if it was ever just a dream.
