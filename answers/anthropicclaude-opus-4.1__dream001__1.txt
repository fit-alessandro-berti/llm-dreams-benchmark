...run through the twisting streets, but the harder I try to move, the slower my legs become, like wading through honey. The buildings around me keep shifting - one moment they're gleaming glass towers, the next they're ancient stone structures with ivy crawling up their walls.

I pull out my phone to check the address, but the screen shows only swirling colors and symbols I can't read. A stranger in a purple coat walks by, and I know with dream-certainty that they know where I need to go. When I call out to them, they turn and smile, but instead of giving directions, they hand me a compass that points to seven different norths.

Suddenly I'm in an elevator going sideways through the city. Through the glass walls, I can see into office windows where people are calmly working underwater, papers floating around them like fish. The elevator operator is my third-grade teacher, who tells me I'm late for the test I never studied for.

I step out onto a rooftop garden where the meeting has already started. Everyone at the conference table has my face, and they all turn to look at me expectantly. I realize I'm supposed to give a presentation, but when I look down, I'm wearing pajamas and holding a butterfly net instead of my briefcase.

The city bells chime thirteen times, and I wake up.
