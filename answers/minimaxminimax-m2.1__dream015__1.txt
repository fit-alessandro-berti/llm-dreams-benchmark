Despite the hardships, you decide to make the long journey to the rumored settlement in the northern mountains—a place where survivors say the water still runs clean and the soil grows food without poison.

Your backpack is light: a quarter-full water jug, some dried meat that might last three days, a rusted knife you've sharpened until it gleams, and a photograph you found in an abandoned house years ago. A woman with kind eyes, a child on her lap. You don't know who they were, but you carry them with you like a promise.

The first day takes you through the ruins of what was once a city. Concrete skeletons of buildings pierce a grey sky. You navigate by memory and the positions of the stars, avoiding the cracked highways where raiders watch from burned-out cars. You travel by day because the things that come out at night are worse than any human danger.

On the second day, you find a stream running clear over rocks—a miracle. You fill your jug and sit beside it, eating your meat slowly, savoring each bite. A bird sings in a dead tree nearby, and you realize you haven't heard music in three years. You stay there until the shadows lengthen, memorizing the sound.

On the third night, you see fire in the distance. Not the orange glow of burning, but the warm yellow of a campfire. Your heart pounds. You approach carefully, creeping through brush until you can make out figures around the flames.

There are seven of them. They see you, and hands reach for weapons. But then an older woman with grey-streaked hair says something, and they relax. She looks at you with eyes that have seen too much but haven't given up.

"Looking for somewhere to belong?" she asks.

You step into the light.

The dream shifts, softens, and somewhere in the waking world, you begin to smile.
