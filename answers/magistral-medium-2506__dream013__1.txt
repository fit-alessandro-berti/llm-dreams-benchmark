**Dreamscape Completion:**

You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, you notice the walls subtly shifting—like a living labyrinth adjusting its paths. A faint, melodic hum pulses through the air, almost as if the maze itself is whispering clues to those who listen closely.

Suddenly, you reach a chamber where the walls are covered in glowing symbols. A riddle appears, carved into the floor beneath your feet:

*"I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?"*

You ponder for a moment, then smile as the answer comes to you—an echo. As soon as you speak the word aloud, the floor beneath you transforms into a bridge of light, carrying you to the next level of the maze.

But as you step forward, the maze darkens. The puzzles grow stranger—now they involve mirrors, shadows, and reflections that don’t behave as they should. One puzzle shows your reflection making movements you didn’t perform. Another demands you solve a riddle written in a language you’ve never seen before, yet somehow, you understand it.

At the heart of the maze, you find a door with no handle. A voice—your own, yet not yours—echoes from somewhere beyond it:

*"To leave, you must first remember why you came."*

And then, just as the dream begins to blur at the edges, you wake up—with the faintest sense that the maze wasn’t just a dream, but a test of something deeper within you.

Would you like to explore another layer of the dream? Or perhaps unravel a different kind of puzzle?
