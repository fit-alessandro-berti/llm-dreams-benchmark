…follow them through the bright, shifting streets, half convinced they’ll vanish if you blink. The city sounds—horns, footsteps, a distant train—blend into something almost musical, like the place is humming itself awake.

One of the strangers walks beside you without ever quite turning their head. “You’re trying to get somewhere you haven’t named yet,” they say, as if it’s the most ordinary thing in the world.

“I don’t even know where I’m going,” you admit, and the words come out as breath in cold air, even though it isn’t cold.

“That’s why we can help,” another says. They hold out a paper cup of tea that smells like rain on warm pavement. You take it, and the warmth travels down your arms and into your chest, steadying something that had been trembling.

They lead you through an alleyway painted with murals that move when you aren’t looking directly at them—birds unpainting themselves from walls, a doorway that appears and disappears with each blink. At the end of the alley, there’s a subway entrance you could swear wasn’t there a moment ago, its stairwell lit like a small dawn.

The strangers stop at the top step. “We can only walk with you until you choose,” the first one says gently.

“Choose what?”

“Which way you want to be found,” they reply.

You look down the stairs and see not one platform, but several, each one holding a different version of the city. In one, people hurry by with their faces tucked into collars and phone screens; in another, the same people look up and smile at each other as if they remember something important. In a third, the walls are covered in posters with your handwriting, announcing things you’ve never said out loud.

Your loneliness, which had felt like a weight, loosens—still present, but no longer pressing you flat. You realize the city hasn’t been rejecting you; you’ve been walking through it without letting it see you.

You step forward, but instead of choosing a platform, you choose a smaller thing: you turn toward the strangers.

“Will you come with me?” you ask, surprising yourself with how simple it sounds.

They exchange looks—fond, amused, proud. “We already are,” one says, and taps your chest lightly with two fingers.

The cup of tea in your hands becomes a small compass. The surface ripples, and the ripples point. Not north, not south, but inward—toward a feeling you recognize as home, even if you can’t yet describe it.

You start down the stairs. With each step, the city above quiets, not fading, but settling into place. Halfway down, you glance back.

The strangers are still there, but now they look familiar in a way that makes your throat tighten: a teacher who once said you were capable, a friend you lost touch with, a neighbor who used to wave, a cashier who remembered your name. And threaded among them, faces you don’t fully recognize—future kindnesses, people you haven’t met yet but will.

They don’t wave goodbye. They simply watch, as if they trust you to arrive.

At the bottom of the stairs, the platform is empty except for a single bench and a station sign that reads, in plain black letters:

**YOU ARE HERE.**

You sit, and the bench is warm, as though someone stood up only seconds ago. The air smells like clean paper and oranges. The loneliness tries to return, reaching for you out of habit, but it can’t quite find a place to hook itself anymore.

A train approaches, not with a roar but with a soft rush like turning a page. Its windows glow, and in them you see your own reflection—tired, yes, but clearer. Present.

The doors open.

Inside, there are seats, and space beside the window, and the quiet certainty that you don’t have to know the entire route to take the next stop.

You step on.

As the doors close, a calm voice announces: “Next station: **Name It.**”

And you finally understand: the way out was never hidden in the city. It was waiting in your willingness to be guided, to accept help, and to decide—gently, bravely—where you want to go.

The train begins to move, and the lights outside stitch themselves into a soft ribbon of dawn.

You lean your head against the glass, and for the first time in the dream, you aren’t searching.

You’re going.
