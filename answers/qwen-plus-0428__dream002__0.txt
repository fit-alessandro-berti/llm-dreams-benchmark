You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and **the trees begin to whisper in a language you don't understand**. The air becomes thick with tension, and for a moment, you feel like you're being watched. Then, the ground beneath you starts to shake, and a loud roar echoes through the forest.

As the storm grows stronger, you notice that the trees are not just trembling—they’re **moving**. They shift and twist, forming shapes that look like ancient figures or faces. A **figure emerges from the shadows**, its face obscured by a veil of mist, but its eyes glow with an otherworldly light.

You freeze, heart pounding. The figure speaks, its voice like wind through leaves:

> *“You have come far, traveler. But the path you seek is not one of peace. It is a path of reckoning.”*

The storm intensifies, lightning splitting the sky. You realize you're not alone. The figure leads you deeper into the forest, where the trees grow taller and more twisted, as if they are alive. The air is heavy with memories, and you begin to see fragments of your past—scenes you never remembered, moments that haunt you.

Suddenly, the figure’s form begins to dissolve, and you are left standing in the middle of the storm, surrounded by towering trees that seem to pulse with life. You hear a voice in your head, soft and familiar:

> *“You are not alone anymore.”*

And then, the storm passes. The forest returns to its peaceful state, but you feel something deeply changed. You wake up, disoriented, the weight of the dream lingering in your mind. As you sit up, you glance at the clock—**it's 3:00 AM**.

You know this dream is not over.
