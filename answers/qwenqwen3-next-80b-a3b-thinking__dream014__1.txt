The city hums around you—headlights streaking like golden fish in the concrete river, voices blending into a distant roar. Your feet feel heavy on the cold pavement, the map in your hand useless against the neon maze. Then, a hand touches your arm. Not a stranger, but a woman with tired eyes and a scarf knotted loosely around her neck. "You look like you’re chasing something that’s already left," she says softly. Behind her, two others join: a man sketching buildings on a pad, and a child clutching a paper boat.  

The man glances at your map, not with pity, but curiosity. "This street’s a dead end for tourists," he says, tapping a squiggly line. "But there’s a little bakery two blocks over—their croissants are worth getting lost for." The child hands you the paper boat. "For sailing on the river," they whisper, then tugs your sleeve toward a side alley where sun-baked walls glow orange in the twilight.  

You follow them past overflowing flower stalls and laughing groups, the city’s sharp edges softening. When you reach the bakery, the woman pulls out two steaming cups of chai. "Take these," she insists as the others slide away into the crowd. "We all get lost sometimes. It’s just borrowed time to remember how warm the world can be."  

You stand there, the cup warming your palms, watching the city breathe. For the first time, the noise doesn’t feel like chaos—it sounds like a hundred stories waiting to be heard. You aren’t found yet. But you’re no longer alone in the finding.
