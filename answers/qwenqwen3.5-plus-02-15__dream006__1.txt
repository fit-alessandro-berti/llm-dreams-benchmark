...begin to speak, but no sound comes out. Instead of words, a cascade of glowing, iridescent butterflies spills from my lips, fluttering silently into the spotlight. The audience doesn't seem confused; they lean forward, their eyes wide with wonder as the butterflies swirl around the theater, painting the air with shifting colors that match the rhythm of my unspoken thoughts.

Suddenly, the stage floor dissolves into a field of soft, warm moss, and the chairs transform into floating clouds. I realize I'm not giving a speech at all—I'm conducting a symphony of light. With every gesture of my hand, the butterflies dance faster, weaving a story that everyone understands instantly, without needing a single word. The fear of judgment melts away, replaced by a profound sense of connection, as if we are all sharing one single, vast dream together. Then, the largest butterfly lands on my nose, and the world gently fades into white.
