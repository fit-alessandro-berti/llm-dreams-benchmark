... feel a cold dread settle in your stomach.  The project brief isn't a document at all – it's a live, wriggling octopus that lands on your desk, its tentacles unfurling to reveal tiny screens displaying rapidly changing equations.

Your boss, instead of being impatient, smiles in a way that's unsettlingly calm, their eyes reflecting the flickering equations.  They gesture vaguely towards the octopus with a pen that seems to be made of pure shadow and says in a voice that echoes slightly, "Just... *handle* it. By lunchtime."

Lunchtime? It's barely 9 AM!  You stare at the octopus, which is now tapping out a complex rhythm on your keyboard with one tentacle, causing error messages to flash across your monitor in a language you don't recognize but somehow *understand* is deeply, profoundly wrong.

Panic starts to bubble in your chest. You look around the office.  Your coworkers are all frozen in place, mid-conversation, mid-sip of coffee, their faces oddly blank, like mannequins.  The air is thick and smells faintly of ozone and burnt toast.

You try to speak, to protest, to even ask what the *project* even *is*, but your voice catches in your throat.  It feels like you're underwater, muffled and heavy.  You reach out a trembling hand towards the octopus, and its nearest tentacle, covered in tiny, blinking lights, recoils as if burned.

Suddenly, the office walls begin to shimmer and distort.  The fluorescent lights flicker and die, plunging the room into a strange, pulsating twilight.  The octopus on your desk glows brighter, its equations now swirling like miniature galaxies.  Your boss's smile widens, becoming almost unsettling, their eyes now seeming to reflect not just equations, but entire nebulae.

A low hum starts to vibrate through the floor, growing louder and louder.  The frozen coworkers begin to twitch, their blank faces cracking into grotesque smiles.  You feel a strange pull, as if the floor is tilting beneath you.

Then, the octopus speaks, its voice surprisingly high-pitched and squeaky, "Tick-tock, tick-tock! Lunchtime is approaching!  And the universe, as you know it… is rather hungry."

And with that, the equations on its tentacles begin to spin faster and faster, blurring into a blinding white light, and you feel yourself being pulled… **upwards**, away from your desk, away from the office, towards the swirling, luminous octopus and the impossibly smiling boss, into the blinding, equation-filled light…

…and then you jolt awake in your bed, heart pounding, the lingering scent of burnt toast inexplicably in the air.  You glance at your alarm clock – it's 8:59 AM.  Just before work.  And for a moment, you swear you can still hear a faint, squeaky voice whispering, "Tick-tock..."
