Okay, I'm drifting...

You are at a large social gathering, a vast, echoing ballroom perhaps, or maybe an outdoor festival under a strangely colored twilight sky. The air hums with a cacophony of laughter, music I can't quite place, and snippets of conversations that dissolve before I can grasp them. I only know one person here: my childhood best friend, Alex. I need to find them, a knot of anxiety tightening in my chest amidst the overwhelming newness.

As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and...

...the first group is clustered around a fountain that seems to be flowing with shimmering, iridescent soda. They're all holding tiny, thimble-sized glasses and toasting each other with exaggerated formality, their voices high-pitched and sing-songy. One of them, with spectacles perched precariously on their nose, offers me a thimbleful. It tastes like fizzy moonlight and forgotten memories. I thank them and move on, scanning the crowd.

Then, I stumble into a circle where people are engaged in a silent, intense game of charades. But instead of acting out movie titles or simple phrases, they're attempting to convey complex philosophical concepts. One person is flailing dramatically, trying to embody "ephemeral existence," while another contorts themselves into a pretzel, presumably representing "the paradox of free will." They don't even glance at me as I edge past, feeling profoundly un-philosophical.

Further on, the music shifts, becoming a jaunty, slightly off-key polka. A group of people, all dressed in mismatched, brightly colored animal costumes (a bear dancing with a flamingo, a giraffe waltzing with a badger), are hopping and twirling with manic energy. They try to pull me into their dance, their plush paws surprisingly strong, but I manage to slip away, a stray feather clinging to my sleeve.

I think I see Alex's distinctive green jacket near a towering cake made entirely of glowing jellybeans. My heart leaps. I push through a throng of people who are all meticulously polishing individual blades of grass they've plucked from... somewhere. They hum a low, resonant C-note as they polish.

As I get closer to the jellybean cake, the person in the green jacket turns. It's not Alex. It’s a kindly-looking elderly woman with Alex’s jacket on, and she’s carefully replacing a fallen jellybean on the cake. She winks at me and says, "He said you'd be looking for this. Said to tell you he's waiting by the place where the whispers collect."

Whispers collect? What does that even mean? I look around, bewildered. The ballroom/festival ground seems to stretch infinitely. Then I notice it – a quiet corner, almost hidden behind a curtain made of what looks like woven starlight. From it, I can hear a soft, sibilant chorus, like many voices sharing secrets.

I head towards it, a new sense of purpose, and a touch of dream-logic acceptance, guiding me. The air grows cooler, the cacophony of the party fading behind me as I approach the shimmering curtain... and just as I'm about to pull it aside... I feel the familiar sensation of my own pillow beneath my cheek. The whispers fade, and the heavy feeling of sleep starts to lift. But for a moment, I can almost still taste that fizzy moonlight.
