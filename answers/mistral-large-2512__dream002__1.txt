The wind begins to howl through the trees, their branches twisting like skeletal fingers against the darkening sky. The air grows thick and heavy, charged with an eerie electricity that prickles against your skin. You quicken your pace, but the path beneath your feet shifts—roots slither like serpents, and the earth itself seems to breathe, rising and falling in slow, unsettling waves.

A distant rumble shakes the ground, and the first fat raindrops fall, not as water, but as something thicker, darker—almost like ink. The droplets hiss where they land, sizzling against leaves and stone. The forest around you groans, the trees bending unnaturally, their bark splitting to reveal glowing veins of amber light pulsing beneath.

Then, the storm breaks in full.

A deafening crack splits the sky, and a bolt of lightning strikes the heart of the forest—not with fire, but with *sound*. A deep, resonant hum vibrates through your bones, and the world around you *shifts*. The trees melt into towering, obsidian spires, their surfaces etched with strange, shifting runes. The ground beneath you is no longer soil but a vast, mirror-like expanse that reflects not your face, but a version of you you don’t recognize—older, wiser, or perhaps something *else* entirely.

A voice whispers on the wind, neither kind nor cruel, but *ancient*:

*"You were never lost. You were* waiting.*"*

The storm rages on, but the rain no longer falls from above—it *rises* from the mirrored earth, swirling into the shape of a figure made of liquid shadow. It reaches for you, not with malice, but with an almost desperate familiarity. The air hums with forgotten words, and for a moment, you understand them—

Then you wake.

(Or do you?)

The forest is gone. You’re standing in a vast, empty hall, its walls lined with doors that weren’t there before. Each one is slightly ajar, revealing glimpses of other worlds—some familiar, some impossible. The figure from the storm stands before you now, solid and real, its form shifting between human and something far older.

It smiles. *"Which one will you open?"*

And the dream begins again.
