...**decide to build a garden.**

Not for sustenance, not really. Food is scavenged, hoarded, fought over. This is different. You find a small, sheltered courtyard, surprisingly intact amidst the leaning skeletons of buildings. The concrete is cracked, but dust and debris have collected over the years, forming a thin layer of potential soil.

Your tools are crude: a shard of thick glass for digging, your own hands for clearing rubble. Resources? You find a forgotten packet of seeds – marigolds, strangely – tucked inside a waterlogged book in a ruined library. Their viability is a long shot, a whisper of a forgotten spring. Water is the real treasure, rationed drop by drop from your scavenged canteen, collected from infrequent, acidic rain.

The dangers are constant. The skittering sounds from collapsed tunnels could be mutated rodents or something worse. The distant rumble might be collapsing structures or the approach of hostile scavengers. Every moment spent kneeling in the dirt, coaxing hypothetical life from dead seeds, feels like an insane gamble.

Yet, you persist. The act itself becomes the reason. Scraping away the grey dust, feeling the rough texture of the broken concrete, placing the impossibly small seeds into the shallow furrows – it's an act of quiet defiance. It's a ritual against the overwhelming decay.

Days bleed into weeks in the dream's disjointed time. You guard the small patch fiercely. One morning, through the grey light filtering down, you see it: a tiny, almost impossibly green shoot pushing through the grime. It's small, fragile, utterly out of place.

A strange, fierce joy blooms in your chest, as vivid and unexpected as the sprout itself. You aren't just surviving anymore. In this small, dusty corner of a dead world, you are *cultivating*. The marigold, if it lives, won't feed you, won't protect you. But as you gently drip precious water onto the tiny leaves, you feel a flicker of something you thought was long extinct: hope. The air suddenly smells less of ruin and more of damp earth, and the harsh sunlight seems, for a moment, almost warm. The dream shifts, the edges blurring, but the image of that tiny green shoot remains, impossibly bright against the desolation.
