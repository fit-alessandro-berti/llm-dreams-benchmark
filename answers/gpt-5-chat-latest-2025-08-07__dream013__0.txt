…notice that the walls begin to shift behind you, sealing off the paths you have already taken. The air tastes faintly metallic, and the dim, pulsing light overhead seems to respond to your heartbeat.  

The puzzles grow stranger—no longer simple riddles or mechanical locks, but living enigmas. You are faced with doors that will only open if you can convince them you deserve to pass, bridges made of whispered equations, and mirrors that show you solving the puzzle in a way you haven't thought of yet.  

Each step forward brings both triumph and unease. Shadows begin to form in the corners of your vision, humming in tones that almost sound like voices urging you on—or warning you. You realize that solving each puzzle is not just a requirement for escape, but also changes something inside you—your memories feel... rearranged.  

Somewhere in the twisting corridors, you hear a slow, deliberate tapping, as though someone—or something—else is also navigating the maze. You have the feeling they are always just one puzzle ahead of you, leaving subtle hints or traps in their wake.  

When you finally reach a fork bathed in golden light, you notice that you now hold a key in your hand that you do not remember receiving. On it is engraved a single word you recognize but cannot place. The moment you focus on it, the maze seems to hold its breath—waiting for your next move.  

Do you want me to continue this dream into an **ending** or turn it into an **interactive puzzle story** so you can play through it?
