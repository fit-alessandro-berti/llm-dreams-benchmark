# The Storm Captain's Dream

You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you **feel your hands gripping the wheel, but they're transforming—becoming translucent, made of water themselves.**

The distinction between ship and sea begins to blur. You realize you're not fighting the storm—you're conducting it. Each time you turn the wheel, the waves respond, rising and falling like a symphony. Your crew's faces shift between people you know: your childhood teacher, a stranger from a coffee shop, your own reflection.

"Captain, which way?" they shout, but their voices echo as if coming from deep underwater.

You open your mouth to answer, and instead of words, a flock of white birds pours out, flying directly into the storm clouds. Where each bird enters the darkness, a star appears. The night sky and the ocean have switched places—you're now sailing upward through constellations, the stars rippling like waves.

The ship's wheel has become a compass rose, spinning wildly. Each direction leads to a different door floating in the void: 

- *North: Your childhood home*
- *South: A room you've never seen but somehow recognize*
- *East: A mirror showing someone else's reflection*
- *West: An exit that leads back to the beginning*

Your crew is waiting. The storm is waiting. Everything is waiting for you to choose, but you realize with dream-logic certainty that **you've already chosen, long before the storm began.**

Which door calls to you?
