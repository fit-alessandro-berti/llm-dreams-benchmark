The air thickens like hot syrup, sticky with unspoken words. We’re tangled in the old argument—the one about *paths*. My friend’s voice cracks like dry wood: *"You just don’t get it—you’re condemning us both!"* and I fire back, "No, *you’re* the one burying us in what-ifs!" But as I say it, something shifts. My fists, clenched tight, soften. I stare at my own hands. They’re not hands anymore—they’re twin birds, feathers brushing against my wrists. Beneath my feet, the dusty floor of the argument fractures into a mosaic of stained glass.  

I stop shouting.  

*This is it.* The dream knows I’ve reached the edge. No more words will bridge this. So I take one step forward—past the broken floor, past the heat, past the weight of "right" and "wrong"—and open my wings. My friend goes still. Their voice was the wind, but now the wind stops. Where their eyes should be, two silver moths flutter, fragile and luminous.  

"*Look,*" I whisper, and I don’t know if I’m speaking or the birds are. I tilt my head toward the mosaic floor. The glass shards aren’t broken—they’re * blooming*. Each jagged edge has sprouted tiny blue flowers, roots slicing through the cracks like veins of light. The argument isn’t about paths anymore. It’s about how we burn bridges to see them clearly.  

My friend’s mouth opens. No sound comes out—just a cascade of feathers, drifting like snow. They’re not mad. They’re *awed*. And suddenly, the ceiling isn’t a ceiling at all—it’s the night sky, but pressed close, so close I can see the stars stitching themselves into a map of our shared history. The fight flattens into dust. The worry, the blame, the "I told you so"—it all turns to mist, then rain, then nothing.  

I close my eyes. The dream isn’t about resolution. It’s about the moment before peace. Just birds, blossoms, and the quiet understanding that some cracks don’t need mending—they’re where the light gets in.  

*Then I wake.*  

The scent of rain still lingers on my skin. My fists are hands again—but they’re open.
