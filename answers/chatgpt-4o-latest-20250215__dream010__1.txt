overcome them one by one, proving your skills, creativity, and determination. The final challenge is the most difficult yet—a test designed specifically to push you beyond your limits. You stand in a grand hall, surrounded by an audience of judges, competitors, and past winners who have all walked this path before.

The challenge is revealed: you must create something extraordinary in a limited time, using only the materials provided. Your mind races. You recognize that this isn't just about technical skill—it’s about vision, about passion, about proving that you deserve this job more than anyone else.

As you begin, the world around you starts to shift. The competition floor stretches endlessly, the judges' faces blur, and suddenly, you're not just competing—you’re inside your own imagination. Every idea you’ve ever had, every inspiration you’ve ever drawn from, surrounds you in a swirl of color and sound. You realize the real challenge isn’t the task at hand but whether you can harness this vast, chaotic creativity into something tangible.

Then, it hits you. The perfect idea. You work tirelessly, your hands moving as if guided by something beyond you. The final seconds tick away, and you step back. What you've created is beyond anything you thought possible—a masterpiece that reflects your deepest dreams, your truest self.

The judges rise. The audience holds its breath. A single voice announces the verdict. 

And just as they say your name, you wake up.
