*I approach the blank canvas, and it pulses gently, as if breathing*

The moment my fingers hover near its surface, I realize I don't need brushes here. My thoughts themselves have weight and pigment.

I think of **longing**, and a deep indigo spiral bleeds upward from the bottom corner—but it keeps moving, unwinding itself, refusing to stay still.

I think of **my childhood kitchen**, and the canvas responds with the smell of cinnamon before any image appears. Then warm amber rectangles stack themselves into something almost like a window, but the light coming through is a color I've never seen while awake. Something between gold and a sound.

I step back and notice the canvas is now larger than it was. Or I've grown smaller.

A figure emerges from the painting—it looks like me, but assembled wrong. Kinder eyes. Hands that have made different choices. They reach toward me, and I understand they want to *trade places.*

\Just for a little while,\ but their voice comes out as brushstrokes in the air.

I look down at my own hands and see they're already beginning to fade into burnt sienna at the edges...

*The landscape around us shivers, waiting to see what I choose*
