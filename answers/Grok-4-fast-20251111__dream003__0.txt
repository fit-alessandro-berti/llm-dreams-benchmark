symbols etched into the wood—swirling vines that twist into faces, eyes that seem to follow your gaze, and whispers of ancient languages that hum just below the threshold of hearing. Your fingers trace the grooves, and suddenly, the box warms beneath your touch, pulsing like a heartbeat.

In the dream's logic, keys are for the waking world. Here, you press your palm flat against the lid, and it sighs open, releasing a mist that smells of forgotten summers and rain-soaked earth. Inside, nestled on velvet the color of twilight, lies not treasure, but a mirror—small, ornate, reflecting not your face, but a version of you that's always known the answers.

You lift it, and the room around you dissolves: walls melting into starlit skies, the floor becoming a sea of glowing fireflies. The mirrored you smiles, whispers, "What if the lock was never on the box, but on your questions?" And as the dream folds in on itself, you wake with the mirror's weight still in your hand—except now, it's just your phone, buzzing with a message from someone you've been meaning to call.

Sweet dreams, or whatever this was. What happens next in yours?
