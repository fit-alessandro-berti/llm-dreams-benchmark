written in a language you don’t understand, and the writing seems to shift and change every time you try to focus on a word. Panic starts to rise, but just as you’re about to give up, a stranger in a long black coat approaches you. They lean over and whisper something unintelligible, but their voice sounds oddly familiar. You look down at the exam again, and suddenly, the words make sense—but now the questions are bizarre and unrelated to the class.

Instead of your course material, the exam asks:

1. How many grains of sand would it take to fill the universe?
2. Describe the taste of a memory from your childhood.
3. If you could design a new color, what would it look like?
4. Can you prove that you’re not dreaming right now?

You glance around and realize no one else seems fazed. The stranger is gone, but their presence lingers, like a faint hum in the air. You pick up your pen, and with shaky hands, start to write, hoping somehow these answers will determine your fate.
