 begin to open my mouth, but instead of words, a swarm of monarch butterflies spills from my throat—delicate, orange-and-black wings beating in silence. The audience doesn't react. Their faces are smooth, featureless ovals that reflect the stage lights like polished moons.

I reach for my notes, but the index cards have fused into a single sheet of living moss, damp and pulsing under my fingertips. When I look up again, the auditorium has stretched vertically, the ceiling now miles above, dissolving into clouds. The seats cascade downward in an impossible waterfall, each row smaller than the last, until the people in the back are the size of thimbles, then grains of sand, then stars.

"I—" I try again, and this time my voice comes out as cello music, deep and resonant, vibrating through the floorboards.

The stage beneath my feet is no longer wood but glass, thick and ancient, and below it I can see the ocean—not a reflection, but the actual Atlantic, dark and teeming with bioluminescent creatures that pulse in rhythm with my heartbeat. My shoes have disappeared. My socks are made of fog.

The audience leans forward as one, their smooth faces splitting into crescent-moon smiles. They are waiting, not for the speech I prepared—something about quarterly projections, I think, or perhaps a toast at a wedding—but for the song that is still emerging from my chest. It is not frightening. It is inevitable.

I spread my arms, and the sleeves of my jacket billow into wings. The butterflies settle onto the microphone stand, which has rooted itself into the glass stage, blooming with white lilies. I take a breath that tastes of salt and starlight, and begin, at last, to sing the things I have never known but always remembered.
