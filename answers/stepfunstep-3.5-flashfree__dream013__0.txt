find the puzzles are no longer just on the walls or etched into the floor. They begin to manifest in the air itself—floating symbols that rearrange themselves when you blink, logic gates made of shimmering light that hum with a low frequency you feel in your teeth. The deeper you go, the more the maze seems to *respond* to your thought process. A corridor you just solved a pattern-matching puzzle in will subtly reconfigurate behind you, the solution you used now embedded in the stone like a permanent, glowing scar.

You reach a central chamber where the final puzzle isn't a riddle or a mechanism, but a mirror. It doesn't show your face. Instead, it reflects the labyrinth behind you, infinite and identical in every direction—except in the reflection, every path you *didn't* take is brightly lit, while the one you're on is fading. The understanding doesn't come as words, but as a direct, undeniable knowing: the maze isn't something to be escaped. It *is* the structure of your concentration. Each solved puzzle was a thought made solid, a pathway forged by your own focus. To leave would be to unthink everything you've just built.

You turn from the mirror. The walls ahead are not stone, but a seamless, dark surface. And waiting there, etched in faint, phosphorescent lines, is the first puzzle of the next layer—a puzzle that looks exactly like the one you started with, but you can already tell it’s subtly, fundamentally different. The dream continues.
