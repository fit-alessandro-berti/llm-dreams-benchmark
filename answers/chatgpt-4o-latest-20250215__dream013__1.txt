realize that the walls are shifting, rearranging themselves in response to your progress. The air hums with a strange energy, and each solved puzzle opens a new path—sometimes revealing hidden doors, other times transforming entire sections of the maze.

As you continue forward, you notice that the puzzles are no longer just riddles or mechanical locks—they begin to challenge your very perception of reality. One asks you to step through a mirror, and as you do, the world inverts, colors shifting into hues you've never seen before. Another puzzle requires you to solve a sequence of symbols that seem to whisper thoughts directly into your mind.

The deeper you go, the more the maze feels alive, as if it's testing you, learning from you. Shadows flicker at the edges of your vision, but when you turn to look, there's nothing there. 

Then, you reach a vast chamber at the heart of the maze. Floating above the ground is a glowing, crystalline structure, pulsating with knowledge. As you step closer, a voice echoes in your mind:  

*"You have come far. But do you seek escape… or understanding?"*  

The walls ripple again, and suddenly, you are faced with a choice—two doors appear, one glowing with golden light, the other shrouded in darkness. You feel a pull toward both, as if they represent two versions of your destiny.

Which do you choose?
