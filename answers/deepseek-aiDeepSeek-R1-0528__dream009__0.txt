The dream continues...

...you realize you need to **find water**. Your throat is parched, the unfamiliar air thick and dusty. Sunlight filters through rough-hewn timber beams above you – you're in a simple, one-room dwelling with packed-earth floors and a thatched roof. The smell of woodsmoke and damp earth hangs heavy.

Outside, a narrow dirt path winds between similar cottages. People move with purpose – women in long, coarse dresses carry baskets, men in tunics and hose guide oxen pulling wooden carts. No wires, no engines, no glass windows... just the creak of wood, the clop of hooves, and the murmur of voices speaking a dialect you can't quite grasp. **You need to understand them.**

A woman approaches, her face lined but kind, carrying a clay jug. She gestures towards your strange clothing (modern pajamas? A t-shirt?) and says something melodic but unintelligible. Her eyes flicker with curiosity and concern. **You need to communicate.** You mimic drinking, pointing to your mouth. Understanding dawns on her face. She smiles, offers the jug. The water is cool, slightly earthy, but life-giving.

As you drink, you look past her. At the end of the path, on a slight rise, stands a structure unlike the others: a sturdy stone tower, weathered but imposing. A crow perches atop its crenelated roof, watching. A strange, almost magnetic pull emanates from it. **You need to know why.** It feels like the key, the reason you're here, whispering promises of answers... or perhaps dangers you can't yet fathom.

The dream lingers on that tower, the crow taking flight, and the profound sense of being utterly adrift in time, driven by basic needs and an inexplicable pull towards the unknown stone sentinel.

**What happens next?** Do you:
1.  Follow the pull towards the tower immediately?
2.  Try to learn the language and integrate with the villagers first?
3.  Search for clues about *when* and *where* you are?
4.  Feel a surge of panic and try to find a way "back"?
