learn how to navigate and adapt to this unfamiliar time period. You notice people going about their daily lives, dressing and speaking differently from what you're used to. Nervously, you approach a friendly-looking person and, trying to use the language but fearing it might not be understandable, ask for help in understanding the customs and finding your place in this new world. Surprisingly, they understand and kindly offer to guide you through the basics of survival, language, and social norms. As you spend more time in this era, you gradually develop a sense of belonging, forming bonds with those around you and even contributing to the community with your unique perspective and knowledge from the future that you've adapted to fit this time.
