…and you feel that strange dream-logic pressure building in your chest. You open your mouth to tell your boss the deadline is unreasonable, but instead of words, a stack of papers pours out—endless, fluttering sheets covered in symbols you’ve never seen before.

Your boss doesn’t react at all. He simply nods, as if this is perfectly normal, and gestures for you to follow him. When you look down, the office floor has turned into a long moving walkway, like an airport conveyor belt, but it’s carrying everyone backward while you try to move forward. Each step feels like pushing through warm sand.

As you struggle, the lights flicker, and every cubicle suddenly stretches upward into towering skyscrapers of beige fabric and buzzing fluorescent bulbs. Screens pop out from the walls, each showing countdown timers—every one of them already at **00:00**.

Your boss finally stops, turns to you, and says calmly:
**“All you have to do is start.”**

And suddenly the papers that spilled from your mouth lift into the air, swirling around you like a storm of ideas. One lands in your hand—blank except for a single button printed on it, labeled **BEGIN**.

When you press it, the entire office dissolves into a soft white glow, and the overwhelming pressure melts away.

What happens next in your dream?
