The stage lights blur into a soft, golden haze as you take a deep breath, the weight of the moment pressing against your chest like a warm, familiar hand. The audience isn’t just a sea of faces anymore—they’re shifting, morphing into something else. Somewhere in the front row, your childhood dog wags its tail, its fur shimmering like liquid silver. A few seats over, your third-grade teacher nods encouragingly, though her face keeps flickering between her wrinkled, kind self and a younger version with braids and a mischievous grin.

You open your mouth to speak, but the words don’t come out as planned. Instead of your prepared speech, a melody spills forth—a song you don’t recognize, yet somehow know every note of. The audience leans in, their expressions rapt, and suddenly, the stage beneath you dissolves into a vast, star-strewn sky. You’re floating now, weightless, the microphone in your hand transforming into a glowing comet tail that trails behind you as you drift upward.

Below, the crowd has become a constellation of their own, each person a point of light connected by invisible threads. You realize you’re not just speaking to them—you’re *conducting* them, like an orchestra of souls. The song swells, and the stars hum in harmony, their voices weaving into a chorus that vibrates through your bones.

Then, just as suddenly as it began, the music fades. The stage snaps back into place, the lights dim, and the audience erupts into applause—but their hands are made of petals, raining down around you in slow motion. You look down at your notes, but the paper is blank except for a single, handwritten line in ink that wasn’t there before:

*"You were never supposed to be afraid of the dark."*

The crowd begins to chant your name, but their voices sound like waves, like wind through trees, like the first breath of a newborn. You smile, because you finally understand: this wasn’t a speech. It was a beginning.

And then—you wake up.
