### **You Are Walking Through a Peaceful Forest...**

The air is crisp and filled with the scent of pine and damp earth. Sunlight filters gently through the canopy, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. Birds chirp softly in the distance, and the only sound is the rustle of leaves under your boots. You feel calm, centered—like the forest itself is breathing with you.

Suddenly, the wind shifts.

It starts with a whisper—a faint, almost imperceptible tremor in the trees. Then it grows, swirling through the branches like an unseen spirit. The light dims as thick, heavy clouds roll in from the horizon, swallowing the sky whole. The air turns cold and electric, charged with an oncoming storm.

You feel a storm approaching and…

**Your senses sharpen.**

The calm vanishes like mist under a flame. You glance around, instinctively looking for shelter. Ancient oaks loom overhead, their gnarled roots twisting from the earth like the veins of a sleeping giant. The sky, once blue, is now a swirling mass of gray and green—unnatural hues that make your skin prickle.

Leaves begin to swirl around your ankles, lifted by gusts that seem to come from nowhere and everywhere. A low rumble shakes the ground—not thunder, not yet—but something deeper, older. The trees themselves seem to shudder in response.

You pull your jacket tighter and move toward the base of a massive fir, its trunk wide enough to offer at least a moment of protection. As you press your back against the bark, you notice something strange: the forest around you isn’t reacting the way it should.

Birds have stopped singing.

The animals have gone silent.

Even the wind seems to hold its breath.

Then, from the edge of the clearing, you see it.

A figure—half-hidden behind a blackened cedar—watching you. Their form flickers like a mirage, one moment solid, the next dissolved into mist. Their eyes, if they even have them, gleam with a pale, violet light. They don’t move, but you *feel* them waiting, as if the storm itself has taken shape.

The first drops of rain begin to fall—cold, sharp, hissing against the leaves. You reach for the small satchel at your side, fingers brushing the wooden whistle hanging from a leather cord. You’ve carried it since childhood, a talisman from a storm you barely survived.

You raise it to your lips.

But before you can blow, the ground beneath you shudders again—this time with purpose. Roots begin to writhe like snakes, curling toward your feet. Above, the clouds twist into shapes that resemble faces, screaming soundlessly.

The storm has arrived.

And it *wants* something from you.

**What will you do next?**  
Will you sound the whistle and see what answers the call?  
Or will you run deeper into the forest, where the trees grow black and the air tastes of iron and forgotten memories?

The storm is no ordinary one. It is a mirror. A door. A reckoning.

And you are standing at its edge.
