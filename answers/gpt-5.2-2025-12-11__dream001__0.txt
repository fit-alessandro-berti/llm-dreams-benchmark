You start to walk faster, then faster still, as if speed alone can conjure the missing address. The streets keep rearranging themselves with the casual confidence of a magician—alleys widening into boulevards, boulevards pinching into staircases, staircases spilling into markets where everyone is selling the same object: folded maps with the corners torn off.

A woman at a kiosk calls your name the way an old friend does, as if she’s been expecting you. She slides a map across the counter. It’s blank except for a single red dot that pulses like a heartbeat.

“Where’s the meeting?” you ask.

She tilts her head, listening to something you can’t hear. “You’re late for it,” she says. “But you’re early for everything else.”

The red dot begins to move.

You follow it.

It leads you into a subway station that smells like rain on warm stone. The sign above the stairs reads **NEXT TRAIN: ONE HOUR AGO**. People stand on the platform holding briefcases and bouquets, their faces softly blurred, as if the city hasn’t rendered them all the way yet. When the train arrives it doesn’t roar; it sighs, doors opening with the gentleness of a secret being told.

Inside, every advertisement is for you. Not your face—your habits: *PROCRASTINATION, NOW WITH FREE SHIPPING.* *CONFIDENCE: LIMITED TIME OFFER.* *REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORDS.* The seats are upholstered in a fabric patterned with tiny calendars, each day crossed out except today, which is circled twice.

A man across from you looks up from a newspaper. The headline reads: **MEETING STILL UNLOCATED; ATTENDEE REMAINS HOPEFUL.** He folds it neatly and says, “You can’t get there by knowing where it is.”

“Then how?” you ask, because that’s the only reasonable question in an unreasonable place.

He points at your chest with two fingers, not accusing, just precise. “By remembering what it’s for.”

The train lurches—not forward, but inward. The lights flicker and for a moment the windows don’t show tunnels; they show rooms from your life like slides held to a projector: a desk under a lamp, a kitchen at night, a doorway you once didn’t walk through, a message you meant to answer.

The red dot on your blank map grows brighter. It isn’t on the paper anymore. It’s in your hand, under your skin, warming your palm.

The train stops. The station name is a word you almost recognize: **AGENDA**. Or **AGAIN, DA**. Or **A GENTLE DARE**. The letters keep swapping places until they settle into a name that feels correct in your bones: **ATRIUM**.

You step out. The platform opens into a huge glass-roofed hall filled with plants taller than lampposts. Sunlight pours down like water. There are people everywhere now, not blurred, moving with purpose. They hold lanyards, clipboards, coffee cups. It’s the kind of place where meetings happen, where decisions pretend to be permanent.

Your phone buzzes. A calendar notification pops up:

**MEETING: YOU.**
**LOCATION: ROOM 0.**
**STARTS IN: 59 MINUTES.**

Room 0 is not on any directory. You ask a passerby; they shake their head without slowing down. You ask a security guard; he scans your face with a device that only emits a small, tired beep.

“No record,” he says, and then, softer, “Try the elevators that don’t show up in the mirrors.”

You turn, and sure enough, at the far end of the atrium there’s a bank of elevator doors that reflect everyone except you. In their brushed metal surfaces, the crowd flows around an empty space where your reflection should be, like water around a stone.

A small child is standing near the doors, holding one of the torn-corner maps. They look up at you with unsettling calm.

“You dropped this,” they say, and hand you a corner-shaped piece of paper. It’s the missing part of your map. When you press it against the blank sheet, it fits perfectly. Lines appear—streets, names, arrows—unfurling in ink that looks like it’s being remembered rather than written.

Room 0 is drawn not as a place, but as a circle. In the center of the circle is a simple note:

**STOP RUNNING.**

The elevator dings.

Inside, the buttons are labeled with feelings instead of floors: **ANTICIPATION, REGRET, PRIDE, DREAD, RELIEF.** At the bottom is a button with no label, just a small dot the color of your pulsing map.

You press it.

The elevator doesn’t move, but your stomach rises anyway. The walls turn transparent, showing the city outside like a model on a table. Streets connect and disconnect. Buildings breathe, subtly expanding and contracting. Somewhere, a siren wails and then turns into laughter.

A voice comes from the ceiling speaker, familiar in a way that makes your throat tighten.

“Please state your purpose.”

You open your mouth, and for a moment you have nothing but the old reflex: *to be on time, to not disappoint, to not be found out.* The elevator waits. The city waits. The hour you thought you had stretches thin and then thickens again, like taffy.

You try again.

“To…,” you say, and the word comes out steadier than you expect, “to decide what matters. To stop pretending I don’t know.”

The elevator doors open.

Room 0 isn’t a conference room. It’s a small, ordinary space with no windows and a single chair facing another chair. Between them is a low table with a glass of water and a pen. On the wall is a clock with no numbers, just a hand that sweeps in smooth circles like a compass searching for north.

Someone is sitting in the far chair.

It is you, but not exactly: the posture is straighter, the gaze clearer, the expression gentler than your own. They hold a folder with your name on it in the handwriting you used as a child.

You step inside, and the door closes without a sound.

“You made it,” the other you says.

“I don’t know where I’m supposed to be,” you admit, because in this room lying feels impossible.

“That’s fine,” they reply, and slide the folder toward you. “You know what you’re supposed to do.”

You open the folder. There isn’t a contract or an agenda. Just a single sheet of paper with three questions:

1) **What are you avoiding?**  
2) **What do you want, without bargaining for it?**  
3) **What will you do in the next twenty-four hours that proves you meant it?**

Your phone buzzes again. Another notification:

**MEETING ENDS IN: 1 HOUR.**
**MEETING STARTED: ALWAYS.**

You look up. The other you is watching patiently, hands folded, like they have all the time in the world because they are, in a way, made of it.

Outside the room, you can hear the city—distant announcements, footsteps, the murmur of countless urgent plans. In here, the air is still.

You pick up the pen.

The moment the tip touches the paper, the clock hand on the wall pauses, as if the whole dream is holding its breath with you. And as you begin to write, the vast unfamiliar city finally stops shifting—not because you found the correct address, but because you stopped asking the world to hand you one.

The red dot in your palm fades into warmth.

Somewhere, far above the glass roof of the atrium and the rearranging streets, dawn starts to leak into the sky. The light is the color of a new decision.

You bend over the page, and the first answer forms, clear as if it had been waiting there all along.
