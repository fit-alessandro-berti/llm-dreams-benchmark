—you hear the distant rumble of thunder. The leafy canopy above you begins to sway as the wind picks up, making the trees groan and whisper secrets. The air grows heavy and charged, carrying the scent of rain. You look up to see dark clouds blotting out the sun, casting the entire forest in a strange twilight.

A streak of lightning splits the sky, illuminating the path ahead. The gentle forest is suddenly wild and mysterious. You hurry forward, searching for shelter. As you round a mossy boulder, you spot a hollow tree, its trunk open and inviting, almost glowing with an inner golden light.

Just as the first fat raindrops fall, you step inside. The storm rages around you, but within the hollow, the air is warm, dry, and filled with the soft, comforting sound of distant music. You realize you are not alone—the hollow stretches deeper than it should, and deep inside, shadowy figures beckon, smiling gently, offering you a cup of something warm.

You settle down, listening to thunder reverberate like a heartbeat, as the dream shifts, and you realize you are both in the forest and somewhere far beyond it, held safely between worlds as the storm rages on.
