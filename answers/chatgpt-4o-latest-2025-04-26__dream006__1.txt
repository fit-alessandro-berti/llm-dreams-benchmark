speak, but instead of words, a stream of shimmering, colorful light pours from your mouth. The lights twist and dance above the audience, forming shapes â€” a soaring bird, a blossoming tree, a river flowing across the ceiling. 

The crowd gasps, not in fear but in awe. You realize you are not just giving a speech; you are telling a story that transcends language. Each person sees something different in the lights â€” a memory, a dream, a hope they forgot they had. 

You feel the warmth of connection rising from them, like a tide lifting you higher. The stage begins to dissolve beneath your feet, and you are floating now, the light carrying you up into a sky that wasnâ€™t there a moment ago. 

Far below, the audience waves and smiles, their faces shining like stars, and you understand: you have already said everything you needed to say, without a single word. 

Would you like me to continue the dream a little further? ðŸŒŸ
