...and you feel a wave of relief so potent it almost makes your knees buckle. Words feel clumsy, stuck in your throat, so you just manage a shaky nod.

Their smiles are genuine, like unexpected sunshine breaking through thick cloud. They don't bombard you with questions or demand a destination. One of them, an older woman with kind eyes crinkled at the corners and wearing a scarf the colour of a summer sky, simply gestures gently. "Come with us for a bit," she says, her voice calm and soothing, cutting through the city's noise like a soft melody.

Another, a young man carrying a strangely shaped, silent musical instrument, offers you a small, warm bread roll that seems to appear from nowhere. It smells impossibly comforting, like home, though you can't place the memory. You take it, the warmth seeping into your cold fingers.

As you fall into step with them, the bustling city seems to... shift. The harsh sounds dull, replaced by a gentle, rhythmic hum that seems to emanate from the group itself. The frantic pace of the pedestrians around you seems to slow, parting effortlessly to let your small procession pass, almost as if you've stepped onto a different layer of reality. The towering, grey buildings begin to shimmer subtly, their sharp edges blurring, taking on softer hues of lavender and rose in the periphery of your vision.

They lead you not towards a main road or a transit station, but down a narrow, winding alleyway you're certain wasn't there a moment before. Glowing moss clings to the brickwork, pulsing faintly, and the air smells sweet, like night-blooming jasmine and rain. You don't know where you are going, the feeling of being lost hasn't entirely vanished, but the *aloneness* has. It's replaced by a curious warmth, a sense of being gently carried along by a benevolent current. You trust them, implicitly, the way you only can in dreams, eager to see where this strange, luminous path will lead.
