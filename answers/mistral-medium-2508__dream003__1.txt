symbols etched into its surface—some resembling constellations, others like ancient runes or alchemical signs. The box hums faintly under your fingertips, as if alive, and the air around it shimmers with a faint, otherworldly glow.

As you trace the patterns with your fingers, one symbol—a spiral that seems to pulse like a heartbeat—begins to warm beneath your touch. Suddenly, the box *clicks*, and a hidden compartment slides open on its side, revealing a small, tarnished key. But before you can grab it, the key *floats* upward, suspended in midair, as if pulled by an unseen force.

A whisper slithers into your mind, not in words but in *feeling*: *"Speak the name of what you seek, and the path will open."* The box’s lid creaks slightly, as though waiting. The symbols glow brighter now, shifting like liquid silver, rearranging themselves into a question:

**"Do you seek the truth that unravels,
the memory that lingers,
or the door that was never closed?"**

Your breath catches. The dream tilts—suddenly, you’re no longer in a room but standing at the edge of a vast, star-strewn abyss. The box is now a gateway, its edges dissolving into mist. Behind you, shadows stretch like grasping hands, while ahead, a bridge of light flickers into existence, one plank at a time, forming only as you take each step.

The key hovers just out of reach, now glowing with the same eerie light as the bridge. The whisper returns, urgent: *"Choose. But know this: some locks should never be picked."*

**What do you do?**
(Do you answer the box’s question? Grab the key? Step onto the bridge? Or something else entirely?)
