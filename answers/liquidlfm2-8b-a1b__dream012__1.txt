can feel the storm’s fury crash through the timbers of the ship, waves towering like mountains, wind howling like spirits lashing the mast. The horizon has vanished beneath churning grey clouds; visibility is naught but the glimmer of lightning and the ghostly flash of thunder. My voice, steady despite the tremor in my hands, cuts through the chaos.  

“Hold fast, men,” I say, though my voice rarely reaches the storm’s roar. “We sail into the heart of it, not because we fear it—but because *we own* it.”  

I grip the wheel as a massive gust slams against the deck, tearing the sails to shreds. The compass spins wildly, useless in the tempest’s wrath, but I know the true north is not just a point on a dial—it’s conviction. I glance at my first mate, eyes wide with doubt, and grind my teeth against the panic.  

“Keep the sails trimmed! Hold the rigging! We ride this through the storm’s eye—pure and true. The sea may rage, but *we will not break*.”  

Then, through the din, I make a decision—bold, quiet, defiant. I order the helm to steer not toward the eye, but through it. “Take direct charge,” I command. “We’ll sail straight into the eye, where the storm yields, if we trust the path.”  

The moment passes—darkness swells, then a sudden shift. The wind dies. The waves calm. The first beams of dawn pierce the storm clouds, painting the sea with gold and silver. The ship, battered but unbroken, sails where chaos once reigned.  

I lower my voice, no longer directing—but speaking to the silence. “We’ve passed the edge. Let us breathe again. The sea tested us, and we endured.”  

The dream lingers: a captain not unchanged, but transformed—by storm and silence, by fear and faith—untold, but fully alive.
