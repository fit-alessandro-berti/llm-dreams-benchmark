### **The Dream Continues...**

You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice **intricate patterns** etched into its surface—spiraling vines that seem to move when you stare too long, intertwined with symbols you can’t quite place: some like ancient runes, others almost like music notes or forgotten constellations.

The box is cold to the touch, yet it hums faintly, almost imperceptibly, as if it’s alive. You run your fingers over the carvings, and for a moment, the hum grows louder, vibrating through your bones. The patterns seem to shift under your fingertips, rearranging themselves just slightly—**as if the box is testing you.**

Suddenly, the box glows dimly, casting soft pulses of light onto the ground. You realize there is no traditional keyhole—only a smooth, circular indentation in the center, marked by a single, glowing sigil. It flickers between **silver and gold**, depending on the angle of your gaze.

You search your pockets and bag, hoping for something—anything—that might fit. All you find is a small, folded piece of paper you don’t remember putting there. Unfolding it carefully, you see it’s a map—no, not a map of a place, but of **a labyrinth of thought**. Words and images swirl in a circular pattern: *truth, memory, fear, desire, shadow, light…*

You place the paper onto the glowing sigil. It melts into the box like ink into water. The lock clicks—softly, reverently—and the lid creaks open.

Inside, instead of treasure or secrets, there is **a mirror**. Not a reflective one, but one made of **starlight and smoke**. As you lean in, you see not your face, but **a version of yourself you’ve never met**—older, calmer, eyes holding galaxies. This other you speaks without moving lips:

> “You are not meant to open this box for nothing. Choose what you seek: **truth, power, or peace.** But know this—once chosen, the path cannot be retraced.”

Behind the mirror, shadows begin to stir—shapes that look almost familiar, like old regrets or forgotten dreams. The air grows thick, charged with possibility and danger.

What will you choose?
