You start to run, but the street slides under your feet like a treadmill set too fast. The buildings lean in as if they’re trying to listen. Every sign is written in a language you almost understand—letters that keep rearranging themselves when you blink.

A bus sighs to a stop beside you. Its destination display flickers:

**MEETING**
**MEETING**
**MEETING**

The doors fold open with the quiet politeness of an invitation. Inside, every seat is occupied by someone reading the same newspaper. The headline is your name. Beneath it is a photo of you looking surprised, as if the camera caught you mid-thought. The passengers don’t look up, but their fingers turn pages in perfect unison, like they’re all being timed.

You step on anyway. The driver has no face, just a smooth oval where features should be, and a tie with a tiny clock pattern. He tilts his head toward a fare box that isn’t a fare box but a wooden suggestion box labeled:

**WHAT YOU CAN’T AFFORD**

You search your pockets. You pull out a receipt from somewhere, a key that fits nothing, a coin stamped with today’s date, and a small folded paper that feels warm. When you unfold it, it’s a map—except it’s a map of your palm, lines and creases inked like streets. A red X sits at the base of your thumb. Under it, in neat handwriting:

**YOU ARE HERE**
**YOU ALWAYS ARE**

The driver nods as if this counts as payment. The bus lurches forward.

Out the window, the city changes faster than motion should allow. Skyscrapers thin into narrow townhouses; townhouses become corridors; corridors become open-air staircases that lead nowhere and yet somehow connect. You spot a clock tower and latch onto it like an anchor—then it melts into a fountain, pouring hour hands instead of water.

A stop bell rings though no one has pulled the cord. The driver lifts an arm toward the door, and you find yourself standing at the threshold as the bus is suddenly no longer a bus but a quiet hallway.

A receptionist desk waits in the middle of the corridor like it has been expecting you for days. A woman sits behind it, wearing glasses with no lenses. She smiles with the efficiency of someone who has smiled at thousands of lost people.

“Name?”

You tell her, and the sound of your own voice is oddly loud, like speaking in a library.

She flips through a binder filled with blank pages. Each page looks empty until she turns it, and then it looks empty in a different way.

“Ah,” she says, landing on a page that contains, in pale watermark, the outline of a calendar. “You’re scheduled for a meeting in forty-seven minutes.”

Relief hits you so hard you nearly laugh. “Where is it?”

She points down the hall. The hall is longer than it was a moment ago.

“Conference Room B,” she says. “Or A. The rooms trade places when you’re not watching.”

You hurry, trying to keep your eyes on everything at once. The hallway branches, then recombines, then branches again. Doors appear labeled **B**, then **B?**, then **B (TEMPORARILY)**. You choose one and step through.

You’re in a conference room that seems to have been assembled from other rooms’ leftovers. A long table stretches away like a road. Chairs line it, but their backs are all facing the wrong direction, toward the walls. The walls are covered in whiteboards filled with diagrams that feel almost familiar: flowcharts of decisions you once made, boxes connected by arrows, all ending in the same final box labeled **TODAY**.

At the far end of the table sits a person in a suit identical to yours. They’re turned slightly away, looking out a window that shows a different part of the city—one you haven’t seen yet, bright with late afternoon sun.

You clear your throat. “Sorry I’m late.”

They turn. It’s you, but not like a mirror. More like you after a long week of sleeping wrong and holding your breath through conversations. Their eyes are tired in a way you recognize.

“You’re early,” they say, and then glance at the empty wall where a clock ought to be. “Or late. The city keeps time differently depending on what you’re avoiding.”

You start to ask what they mean, but the chair nearest you slides back on its own, inviting you to sit. When you do, the table surface ripples faintly, like skin responding to touch.

A folder appears in front of you. No one hands it to you. It’s just suddenly there, labeled **AGENDA**.

You open it and find a single sheet of paper. The paper is blank except for one question printed in the center:

**WHAT DID YOU COME HERE TO REMEMBER?**

You stare at it until the letters begin to wobble, as if they’re impatient.

“I don’t know,” you admit. Saying it out loud makes it more real.

The other you nods. “That’s why the meeting exists.”

They slide a cup of coffee toward you. You can smell it—bitter and warm—but when you lift it, it’s empty. The cup is hot anyway. Your hands absorb the heat as if you’ve been cold for a long time.

“What happens if I don’t remember?” you ask.

The other you looks past you, toward the door. “Then you’ll keep arriving. Different streets. Different buses. Same hour.”

The room seems to inhale. The whiteboards squeak softly, like markers moving on their own. Your agenda page shifts. The single question fades and is replaced with a list:

1. **WHERE ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE?**
2. **WHO TOLD YOU?**
3. **WHAT DID YOU WANT BEFORE YOU WERE TOLD?**

You read the third line twice. Something in your chest tightens, not pain exactly, but pressure, like a door stuck in its frame.

“I wanted…” You search for it the way you search for a word on the tip of your tongue. Images flash: a small room with a desk by a window; the feeling of making something with no audience; the quiet satisfaction of finishing a thought. The smell of rain on pavement. A laugh you haven’t heard in too long. A phone you keep meaning to call from.

“I wanted time,” you say finally, and the word lands with the weight of truth.

The other you leans back as if the meeting has officially begun. “Good. Time is the only thing this city pretends to sell.”

They gesture to the window. Outside, the sun is lowering too quickly, like someone spinning a dial. Shadows stretch along streets that rearrange to avoid them.

“How do I leave?” you ask.

“You stop trying to find the building,” the other you says. “You decide what the hour is for.”

The paper in front of you turns over by itself. On the back is a simple instruction, typed in the same neat font as the agenda:

**STAND UP**
**WALK OUT**
**DO NOT RUN**

You push your chair back. Your knees feel slightly unreal, like they’re made of remembered movement. When you stand, the room tilts, correcting itself slowly, as if it needs your posture to understand gravity.

At the door, you pause. “Are you coming?”

The other you smiles—small, not unkind. “I’ll be where you put me.”

You step into the hallway. It’s quieter now. The receptionist desk is gone. The corridor leads straight ahead, no branches, no trick doors. At the end, there’s a simple exit sign—no blinking, no language you can’t read—just **EXIT**.

You walk, and the city seems to loosen its grip. The air smells less like paper and more like open space. When you push the door open, you’re not outside the building.

You’re in your own room.

The light is the particular gray of early morning. Your phone lies where you left it. A corner of your blanket is kicked off the bed. Somewhere, a bird repeats a short, stubborn phrase.

You sit up slowly, half expecting the agenda to be in your hands.

It isn’t.

But the feeling of the question remains, clear as a headline:

**What did you come here to remember?**

On your nightstand, your alarm clock reads a time that makes no sense for the dream you just had. You can’t tell whether you lost an hour or gained one.

You reach for your phone and open your calendar. There’s a meeting scheduled later today, and you don’t remember agreeing to it.

Your thumb hovers over the screen.

Outside, the city—your real one—waits, vast and familiar, and for a moment you can almost see the other city superimposed on it, like a transparent map.

You don’t hit “Snooze.”

You don’t hit “Accept.”

You just sit there, listening to your own breathing, and decide what the hour is for.
