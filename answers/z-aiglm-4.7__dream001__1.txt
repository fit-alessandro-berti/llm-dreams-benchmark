run, but the ground beneath your feet feels soft and yielding, like running on a dense marshmallow. Each step takes twice the effort it should. The skyscrapers around you aren't made of concrete and glass; instead, they tower over you as massive, shifting stacks of leather-bound books and antique clocks, all ticking in discordant rhythms.

You frantically pat your pockets for your phone, but instead of a device, you pull out a handful of melting blue crayons. Panic, cold and liquid, floods your chest. You spot a businessman on the corner and rush over to ask for directions, but when he turns around, he has no face—just a smooth, porcelain surface where his features should be. He checks his wrist, which is missing a hand, and simply points a fingerless nub toward a monorail track suspended in the sky by spiderwebs.

You sprint toward the station, but the stairs leading up to it keep multiplying the higher you climb. You look at your wrist to check the time, but you aren't wearing a watch; instead, a tiny, frantic hamster is running on a wheel embedded in your skin. The wheel spins faster and faster. You are running out of time. The meeting is starting without you, and you realize with sudden, terrifying clarity that you aren't wearing pants, and you've forgotten the secret password required to enter the building. Just as you reach the top step, the city dissolves into a cloud of purple dust, and you begin to fall.
