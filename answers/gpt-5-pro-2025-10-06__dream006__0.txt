…speak, or at least you think you do. The microphone warms your breath and returns it to you as a small electric hum. The spotlight rests on your shoulders like a coin the ceiling has pressed there. Dust drifts in the beam. It looks like it’s gently snowing inside.

Your first word slips out sleek and shiny, a silver fish that vanishes into the dark and comes back as ripples—a laugh in the third row, a smile near the aisle. Your second word is a moth; it flutters between your lips and settles on the edge of the podium, folding its paper wings. You glance down and see the podium is not a podium at all but a weathered pier, and the stage is water inked to black glass. Your toes have no shoes. They curl over the edge and find the knot in the wood that means home.

You remember that you forgot your notes—there is a shape of panic like a door swinging open in your chest—and you pat your pockets anyway. They’re filled with smooth stones, warm from your legs. On them, faintly, are written reasons to leave. You take one out, intending to hide it in your palm, but it slips and taps the pier and turns into a bell, small and bright. The chime hangs in the air, becomes your opening line, and the room exhales with you.

In the front row, between a stranger with a velvet scarf and a man who blinks as slowly as a cat, you notice yourself, smaller. Your feet don’t reach the floor. Your collar sits wrong. Your younger you looks up, face open as a door with no lock. Their hands are knotted like your pockets. You realize, with a soft click in your mouth as though biting down on a truth, that you are dreaming. The knowledge doesn’t push you out. It steadies you, like finding the rail in the dark.

You begin to tell them the speech you thought you came to give—about leadership or weather patterns or some bright diagram you built on your desk—and instead your voice opens on something you didn’t pack. You talk about the small courage it takes to cross a room of eyes carrying a bowl of water and how, when it inevitably spills, you can lick your fingers and grin and keep walking anyway. You talk about the way certain mornings arrive like wide windows and others like locked drawers, and how both kinds mean the day loves you enough to look at you. Your words turn to thread in the air and string themselves from the rafters, a line of pennants with your breath as a wind.

The sea of faces rises and falls. In one swell you catch your grandmother’s profile though you never saw her that young; in the next you catch the barista who knows your name in foam; somewhere near the back your favorite teacher nods, and beside her a vacant seat glows faintly, as if applause could sit there. The silence between your sentences grows sweet and round. It holds you. The exit sign over the door becomes a small red door with hinges like wrist bones. It opens just a crack and shows you dawn.

You notice your younger you in the front row lift an invisible object to the light. It is a string—no, it is the line of your voice. They wind it around their wrist and tug gently. You feel the tug come back through your ribs. You say to them what you wish someone had said to you beneath a different kind of light, years ago: It isn’t always safe, but you are. You are allowed to be seen. You are allowed to not know and still go on.

The backdrop behind you peels up from the floor and becomes a horizon. Your sentences turn into stepping stones laid on the surface of the lake, and it’s the strangest thing—you don’t step; the audience does. They rise as one slow tide, and each person places a foot on a word you’ve offered. The room hums like a hive. Their hands come together not in thunder but in rain, a soft steady drumming that smells like hot pavement and relief. The leaves in your chest stop rattling. You bow. Your shadow bows a little deeper and slips ahead into the wings, impatient, as if it knows the way out.

You want to finish properly. You gather up the loose thread and tie a knot in it the way sailors do when they mean to come back. You take one last look at the younger you, who has finally found the floor with their toes. They give you a brave, uneven smile. You give it back.

To end, you do something impossible and also easy: you blow. The stage lights go out like eight candles on a cake. The auditorium becomes the inside of someone’s cupped hands. The applause continues in the dark, moving through you like rain through leaves. The red door at the back swings wider. Behind it waits a pale square of morning.

When you wake, there’s a pleasant weight in your palm, as if you fell asleep holding a pebble. It’s only the crease of the sheet, but you rub your thumb over it anyway and it rings in your head like a bell. On your tongue, a word you didn’t plan tastes crisp and right. You carry it with you into the day.
