You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are **written in a swirling script that keeps shifting languages—first ancient Sumerian, then emoji, then binary code that morphs into dancing cats mid-sentence**.

Your heart races. You flip through the pages frantically. Question 1: "Explain the migratory patterns of invisible penguins using only interpretive dance notation." Question 2: "If a quantum toaster argues with Schrödinger's cat over breakfast etiquette, who pays the bill and why?" The proctor, a giant floating eyeball with a mustache, leans in and whispers, "Time starts... yesterday."

Sweat drips onto the paper, making the ink bubble and reform into a maze. You try to write an answer—"I don't know!"—but your pencil sprouts legs and runs away. Students around you are turning into furniture: the girl next to you becomes a comfy armchair, offering silent sympathy.

Panic surges. You stand to protest, but the room tilts like a funhouse mirror. The exam booklet grows wings and flaps toward the ceiling, taunting you. Just as you're about to grab it, everything dissolves into rainbow static...

...and you jolt awake in your bed, sheets tangled, alarm blaring. It's 7 AM. No exam today—just coffee and a normal Tuesday. But for a split second, you swear you hear that mustache whispering, "Pencils up."
