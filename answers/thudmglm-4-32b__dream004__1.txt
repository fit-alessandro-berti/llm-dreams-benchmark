...a magnificent, ancient brush lying on the ground beside it. The canvas hums faintly, as if vibrating with latent potential, and the wooden handle of the brush seems to be absorbing the shifting light around you.

Just as you reach for it to see if it works, the world does a sharp 180-degree flip. Gravity momentarily becomes upwards, and you tumble end over end towards the sky, the landscape becoming a dizzying swirl of impossible architecture and melting-haze colors. When you finally land (softly, on something like a fluffy cloud-mattress), the brush and canvas are still there, but now they float gently a few feet off the ground. The canvas has begun to fill itself with the very patterns and colors of the surrounding flux, like a living mirror.

You try to pluck the brush from the air, and suddenly you are inexplicably levitating, pulled towards the canvas. It doesn't feel like flying; it feels more like being gently teleported, step by step, into a new layer of reality painted onto the canvas itself.

Now, instead of the canvas, you are *inside* a scene – a vibrant, chaotic diorama of shifting geometries, where buildings melted into crystal rivers that flowed upwards, and birds with kaleidoscopic feathers sang melodies that prickled like static. The brush floats here too, a beacon of stillness in the swirling riot. It seems to beckon you.
