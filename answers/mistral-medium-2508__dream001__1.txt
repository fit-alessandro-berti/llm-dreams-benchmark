run, your heart pounding in your chest as the towering, labyrinthine buildings seem to shift and warp around you. The streets twist like living things, alleys appearing and disappearing in the corners of your vision. Every sign is written in a script you almost recognize—letters that flicker between familiar and alien, as if the language itself is breathing.

A stranger in a long, tattered coat brushes past you, whispering, *"The Clocktower doesn’t wait for anyone."* You spin around, but they’re already gone, dissolved into the crowd of faceless figures hurrying in every direction. Then you see it: a distant spire piercing the smog-choked sky, its gears grinding slowly, its face showing a time that doesn’t match your watch. *Thirty minutes left.*

You sprint toward it, but the city fights you. Staircases spiral into dead ends. Bridges crumble as you step onto them, reforming behind you. A child with hollow eyes offers you a map, but when you unfold it, the ink bleeds into a single word: **"LOST."** You shove it into your pocket just as the ground tilts beneath you—suddenly, you’re standing on the side of a building, the street now a vertical wall. People walk upside-down below you, indifferent.

A woman in a business suit leans out of a floating tram, her voice echoing unnaturally: *"You’re late. They’ve started without you."* The tram vanishes into a tunnel of swirling colors. Your phone buzzes—no signal, but a single text glows on the screen: **"Turn left at the memory you forgot."**

And then you remember: the meeting isn’t about a place. It’s about *her*. The one you haven’t thought of in years. The café where you last saw her—was it called *The Hourglass*?—materializes at the end of the street, its windows fogged with time. The door is unlocked. Inside, the air smells of burnt sugar and old books. She’s sitting at the same table, her back to you, stirring a cup of coffee that never cools.

The clock on the wall has no hands.

She turns slowly, and her face is—

*(And here, the dream fractures. Do you want to know what she looks like? Or would you rather wake up?)*
