…and you realize, with that weird dream-clarity, that none of them are quite real in the way you expect.

The first group is gathered around a tall, wobbling tower of champagne glasses. They’re all laughing a half-second too late, as if the sound has to buffer before it reaches their mouths. One person is telling a story about a vacation, except every time they say where they went, the name of the place cuts out, like someone muted the audio.

“…and when we finally got to — *static* — the sky was so bright it felt like you could just peel it off.”

They all nod enthusiastically.

Someone turns to you. You can’t see their face clearly; it’s like it’s always a little to the side, even when they’re looking right at you.

“So,” they say, raising an empty glass, “who did *you* come with?”

You open your mouth to say your friend’s name.

Nothing comes out.

Not silence—literally *nothing*. Like the universe skips a frame. Your tongue moves, your throat works, but the word doesn’t exist here.

They all smile politely, waiting, still, frozen. You realize they cannot move forward in time until you answer correctly.

“I’m… looking for them,” you say instead. The word *them* sticks, heavy and vague.

“Oh,” the faceless person replies, and just like that, the whole group restarts, their laughter spooling back up, the story picking up exactly where it left off. You’ve become irrelevant to the scene, like an extra in the background.

You move on.

The second group is sitting in a circle on the floor, even though there are more than enough chairs. They’ve arranged themselves in a perfect ring under a chandelier that flickers between crystal and bare lightbulbs. They’re passing around a bowl filled with small slips of paper, each one folded neatly.

As you approach, someone looks up and gestures you over.

“Take one,” they say, whispering, though the room isn’t loud.

You reach into the bowl. The paper you touch is colder than it should be, almost metallic. You unfold it.

On the slip, in your handwriting, is a sentence you don’t remember writing:

> “You’re not late. Everyone else is early.”

You look up. The person to your left nods like they heard the thought rather than saw the words.

“What does it mean?” you ask.

“What do *you* think it means?” they reply, in perfect therapist cadence.

You want to say, *I don’t know, that’s why I’m asking*, but instead you notice something else: every slip in every other person’s hand also has your handwriting. You squint at one near you, catching pieces of phrases:

> “Stop rehearsing the conversation.”
> “They didn’t forget you. They just never learned you.”

You suddenly don’t want to sit down. You place the slip back in the bowl.

“Have you seen—” Again, your friend’s name vanishes when you try to say it. You feel your mouth shape the word, but reality edits it out.

“Everyone comes back around eventually,” someone across the circle says. “If they’re on the guest list.”

“Who writes the guest list?” you ask.

They all look at you at once, like you’ve asked a question you were supposed to already know the answer to. The chandelier flickers, and for a split second, every face in the circle is your own at different ages: child-you, teenage-you, tired-in-your-thirties you, versions of you with hair you never actually had.

You blink, and they’re strangers again.

You leave quickly.

---

The third group is near a long buffet table that never repeats: every dish is different, every time you glance back. There’s a cake that slices itself. A bowl that refills as someone scoops from it. A plate of appetizers that look suspiciously like little folded versions of the house you grew up in.

You recognize someone here. Not your friend—someone else. An old classmate. An ex. A coworker you haven’t spoken to in years. They all have the same expression: that flicker of *Is that…?* followed by *I don’t want to commit if I’m wrong.*

You wave tentatively at one of them.

Their eyes pass over you once, then again, then slide away as if they’ve changed their mind. They take a small house-shaped appetizer and bite into it. When they do, the music briefly changes to the ringtone you had in high school.

“Hey,” you try again, stepping closer. “It’s me, from—”

“From where?” they ask.

You open your mouth… and there it is again. The missing word. Whatever you name—school, city, job—slips like water through a sieve. You can feel the answer in your mind, full and heavy, but the dream won’t let it be spoken.

“From before,” you say finally.

Their face softens, but only a little. “Oh,” they say. “That’s a lot of people.”

You feel a sudden, irrational embarrassment, like you’ve tried to cut the line with a ticket that’s no longer valid. You back away, bumping the buffet table.

A single appetizer tumbles off the edge and hits the floor without a sound, flattening into a two-dimensional blueprint. You glimpse your friend’s outline in the lines—just a figure, in a room, next to an open door.

You look up to ask someone what it means, but everyone at the table is now interested in something else: a conversation, a drink, a joke you missed. You’re a commercial break in the middle of their favorite show.

You keep moving.

---

The fourth group isn’t talking at all. They’re dancing, slowly and silently, in a space where the music is muffled, like someone’s holding a pillow over the speakers. Their movements are half a beat off each other, never quite syncing. Nobody looks at the person they’re holding; they’re all staring over each other’s shoulders, scanning the crowd.

You realize they’re all searching too.

You spot an empty space on the edge of the dance floor the exact size of you. When you step into it, the person nearest you automatically turns, holds out their hands.

“Have you seen—” you try again. It feels like pushing a forbidden key on a keyboard.

Their hands tighten on yours. “No names,” they say gently. “You’ll wake up.”

“Oh,” you say, stunned. “I’m dreaming.”

“You were told that at the beginning,” they say, as if reminding you of the opening credits.

You dance. The steps are unfamiliar but your body knows them anyway. You’re pretty sure you’re doing it wrong, but in that peculiar dream-way, everyone else’s awkwardness hides your own.

As you sway, you realize the person you’re dancing with looks a little like your friend, if you glance quickly. Their profile has the same angle. Their laugh, when it finally escapes, almost matches. But when you look straight at them, their face rearranges into a stranger’s.

“Why can’t I find them?” you ask, voice low.

“Maybe you did,” they say. “And you walked past without recognizing them. Or maybe—” They spin you around so the room blurs. “Maybe you’re not in the same dream tonight.”

That thought hits in a way that feels too real. You stop moving. The air thickens, like the room doesn’t want you to stand still.

“What happens if I say their name?” you ask.

“Try it,” they say, stepping back. “If you don’t mind the risk.”

You take a breath. You know the name. You can feel it pressing against your teeth like a held-back tide. You start to say it—

—and the lights flicker.

Everything freezes except you.

The dancer in front of you becomes a statue mid-step, the tables around the room flatten into cutouts, the laughter in the distance stretches into a single long note. Only you can move. Only you can think.

A door appears at the far end of the hall. It wasn’t there before. It’s just standing there, unattached to any wall, faint light shining through the gaps around it. On the front of the door, written in a handwriting that *is* yours this time, is your friend’s name.

Every attempt you made to say it was loading, you realize. It just needed somewhere to land.

You walk toward the door. Your steps make no sound. As you get closer, you notice that under their name is another word, one that keeps rewriting itself.

Sometimes it says:

> “Host”

Then:

> “Guest”

Then:

> “Missing”

Then:

> “Found”

You reach for the doorknob.

It’s warm. Familiar. Your heart is racing but you can’t remember if you were nervous or just excited. Both feel the same here.

You hesitate—not because you’re afraid of what’s inside, but because some small rational part of you knows: opening this door might mean the end of the dream. That this is the moment everything collapses into waking.

You turn the knob anyway.

---

Inside is not another room.

Inside is the same party, but quieter. Every sound is wrapped in cotton. The colors are dimmer, like someone turned down the saturation. The groups are still there—the champagne tower, the paper circle, the buffet, the dancers—but they’re copies, running on half-speed.

And your friend is leaning against the far wall, exactly as you remember them from the last time you saw them. Not idealized, not distorted. Just… them. Wearing the face they actually have, the posture they actually hold, the way they really look when they’re tired but still trying.

They see you immediately. No scanning, no doubting.

“There you are,” they say, like you’ve only been gone a minute.

Relief hits you so hard your knees go a little weak.

“I’ve been looking everywhere,” you say, and this time their name comes out perfectly, clean and solid, and the dream doesn’t censor it. It settles into the air and the room accepts it.

“I know,” they say. “I was trying to get to you too. The place kept changing.”

You glance back. The door you came through is gone. In its place is just wallpaper, repeating a pattern you half-recognize from a childhood bedroom.

“Where are we?” you ask.

They shrug. “Somewhere in your head. Somewhere in mine. Call it neutral ground.”

You laugh, unexpectedly close to tears. “Why did it feel so hard to find you?”

They look around at the duplicate groups, the frozen almost-conversations, the tables of impossible food.

“Because you talk to everyone else first,” they say kindly. “Even in your sleep.”

You want to protest, but you can’t. It rings too true.

They nod toward the center of the room. There’s a small table there now with two chairs, real ones, not the weird dream-chairs that collapse into fog when you try to sit on them. On the table: two glasses of water, condensation beading in a way that feels more real than anything else you’ve seen tonight.

“Come on,” they say. “Sit with me for a bit before you wake up.”

You do.

You talk, or maybe you don’t. The details blur in that dream-way. What you remember clearly is the feeling: the sense of *located-ness*, of having finally reached the person you meant to find from the start. Everyone else at the gathering fades to background noise, a party happening in another room, another life.

At some point, without transition, the chair under you becomes your bed, the glass of water becomes the one on your nightstand, and your friend’s face is replaced by the shape burned onto the inside of your eyelids.

You wake up with the distinct sensation that you’re still at the party, still looking, still moving from group to group.

But the first thought that comes to you—before your phone, before your to-do list, before any worry—is their name.

You say it out loud into the quiet room.

This time it doesn’t vanish.
