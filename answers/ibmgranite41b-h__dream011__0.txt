Here is the completion of your dream:

You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions have strange elements in them - they're not standard multiple choice or essay prompts. Each question asks something like "What does this image symbolize?" 

At first it feels odd and off-putting, but as time passes an adrenaline rush builds through your body. You begin to doubt yourself and worry about how you'll perform on such outlandish questions. However, just before the clock strikes 5:00PM - deadline for handing in exams - a lightbulb goes off inside your head.

The last question is phrased as "Explain with an example what it means to have 'the keys to success'". In a rush of realization sparked by this final image and emotional state, you understand the concept. The questions were designed to test how well you can think critically on your feet about intangible ideas like success or career fulfillment - not just specific content knowledge
