In this strange and unfamiliar setting, survival will become the primary concern. Initially disoriented by the lack of familiar technology and civilization, one must quickly adapt to their surroundings. The first action on waking is likely to be surveying the area: observing the landscape, identifying key elements such as water sources, food availability (wild plants or animals), and natural shelter options.

1. **Assessing Surroundings**: Spend a few moments in reflection upon arrival at this new location. Evaluate if there are any clear signs of civilization nearby or any visible threats like predators. 

2. **Locate Basic Needs**: Determine immediately where the safest place to set up camp would be, considering proximity to water (for hydration and potential food resources), shade (to avoid excessive heat), and possibly a natural barrier for protection from wildlife.

3. **Sourcing Water**: If nearby vegetation points to fresh water sources in nearby ravines or streams, investigate them cautiously; however, ensure purification before consumption is mandatory as there's no guarantee of safe drinking water without treatment methods known today.

4. **Gathering Food and Resources**: Look for edible plants by observing indigenous species' signs like droppings or tracks leading towards promising food areas. Gather fruits, nuts, seeds, etc., but be wary of any toxins present in some look-alike varieties.

5. **Building a Temporary Shelter**: Construct a rudimentary shelter using natural materials available like leaves, grasses, branches to protect yourself from the elements and predators during rest periods.

6. **Identify or Create Fire Sources**: Learning how to start a fire is critical; it provides warmth for when nights are cold, and protection against animals while also being essential for cooking food if procured from gathered resources. 

7. **Develop Skills Set**: Recognize that without modern tools at hand, new survival skills must be acquired such as weaving materials into clothing, crafting basic weapons if necessary for defense or hunting small game, knot-tying for securing items etc., which could involve observation and learning from any surviving members of native communities found.

8. **Signal Discovery**: If there's a chance that someone may have passed through the area recently (like footprints or abandoned campsites), use stones, smoke signals, bellies filled with identifiable food to leave clues pointing towards potential rescued humans in direction if they could find you.

9. **Seeking Help**: Depending on where this ancient era lies geographically – either near a settled society or isolated wilderness zones – decide whether reaching out for aid might be feasible by identifying civilization locations using landmarks like rivers, mountains, or coastal areas while respecting the non-interference policy of being lost and unfamiliar to locals.

10. **Monitor Health & Safety**: Keep track of physical well-being; recognize early signs such as dehydration, hunger pangs, fatigue that could signal imminent danger requiring quicker action than planned routine exploration processes above suggest.

By methodically approaching these steps – each dependent upon situational knowledge honed through observation within this unknown period’s constraints — there's potential to either adapt effectively or suffer dire consequences. Persistence and ingenuity will be the deciding factors as one navigates an alien landscape towards possible rescue, rebuilding society in its own image where needed, or establishing temporary autonomy depending on how long they can survive before external intervention arrives.
