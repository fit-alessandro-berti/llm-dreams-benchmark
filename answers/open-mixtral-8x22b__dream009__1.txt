find food and shelter. You start by looking for a reliable source of water, following the sound of a nearby stream. You find a spot where the water is clear and flowing, and you drink deeply, feeling refreshed.

As you explore further, you come across a grove of fruit trees, heavy with ripe fruit. You pick some and eat, feeling the sweet juice run down your chin. You realize that you need to find a way to store some of this food for later, so you gather more fruit and carry it with you as you continue to explore.

You soon come across a small, abandoned hut, which appears to be in good condition. You enter and find it empty, but clean and dry. You decide to make this your shelter for the time being. You store your gathered fruit inside and begin to gather materials to make a fire.

You find some dry wood nearby and use a piece of flint you found to create a spark, igniting the wood in a small fire. You use this fire to cook some of the fruit, making it more palatable and easier to digest.

You spend the rest of the day exploring your new surroundings, finding more sources of food and water, and making improvements to your shelter. As night falls, you settle down in your hut, feeling grateful for the food, shelter, and warmth you have found in this strange new world.

You drift off to sleep, feeling content and secure, knowing that you have the skills and knowledge to survive and thrive in this new era. As you sleep, you dream of the adventures and discoveries that await you in the days to come.
