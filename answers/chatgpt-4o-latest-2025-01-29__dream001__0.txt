wander through the labyrinthine streets, each one looking slightly different but eerily similar at the same time. Buildings tower above you, their architecture blending futuristic glass structures with ancient stone facades. The air hums with an unfamiliar yet oddly comforting energy. People pass you by, their faces blurred and voices distant, as though they exist on a different plane.

You reach into your pocket and find your phone, but the screen is cracked, and the map app only displays nonsensical symbols that rearrange themselves every few seconds. Frustrated, you look around and notice a small kiosk run by an old man with a long, silver beard. The kiosk is filled with maps, compasses, and tiny glowing orbs. He looks up at you with piercing eyes that seem to see straight through your soul.

"You’re lost, aren’t you?" he says, not unkindly. Before you can answer, he pulls out a map unlike any you’ve ever seen. It doesn’t show streets or landmarks, but instead shimmers with shifting colors and abstract patterns that move as if alive. "This map doesn’t tell you where to go," the man explains, "but it shows you where you *need* to be."

Intrigued, you take the map, and as soon as you hold it, the shapes on its surface coalesce into a glowing path. You begin to follow the map’s guidance, weaving through alleyways that seem to twist in ways geometry shouldn’t allow. Along the way, you encounter symbols and signs—some familiar, some cryptic—that feel significant even though you can’t explain why.

Eventually, the path leads you to an ornate door set into an ancient stone wall. You suddenly feel a strange mixture of dread and excitement. The door is carved with intricate patterns that seem to pulse subtly, as if alive. You push it open and step inside.

The room beyond is vast and circular, filled with a soft, golden light that seems to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. In the center of the room stands a single chair, and on it sits… yourself. Or at least, it *looks* like you—a version of yourself slightly older, wiser, with a calm yet intense gaze.

"You made it," your doppelgänger says with a knowing smile. "Now, the real meeting begins."

Before you can respond, both versions of you lock eyes, and the room begins to dissolve into shimmering fragments. Suddenly, you’re falling, or floating upward—it’s impossible to tell—and you hear a voice that sounds like your own, saying:

"Remember why you came here."

You jolt awake, heart pounding, the strange map still vivid in your memory. Was it just a dream, or something more?
