feel a mix of urgency and curiosity as you take in the towering skyscrapers, bustling streets, and neon signs glowing even though it’s daytime. The air smells faintly of rain and freshly baked bread, but there’s no time to stop and savor it—you need to figure out where this meeting is.

You glance down at your hands and notice a small, folded piece of paper clutched tightly in one fist. Unfolding it reveals an address written in elegant cursive: *“347 Lumina Tower.”* But something feels off—there’s no map or directions on the note, just those cryptic words. You look around for any landmarks that might help orient you, but everything seems surreal, almost otherworldly. Buildings shift slightly when you’re not looking directly at them, and shadows stretch longer than they should.

A stranger brushes past you—a woman wearing a coat made entirely of shimmering feathers. She pauses briefly, glancing back with piercing green eyes. “Time flows differently here,” she says cryptically before disappearing into the crowd. Her voice lingers in your mind, leaving behind more questions than answers.

Determined, you decide to ask someone for help. A street vendor selling glowing fruit catches your attention. His cart emits a soft hum, like electricity coursing through wires. When you approach him, he smiles knowingly, as if he's been expecting you. 

“You’re looking for Lumina Tower?” he asks without prompting. You nod eagerly. He points toward a distant spire piercing the clouds, its surface reflecting light in impossible patterns. It looks impossibly far away, yet somehow closer than it should be. 

“It’s not the distance that matters,” he adds, handing you a glowing apple. “It’s how well you listen.”

Confused but intrigued, you bite into the apple. Instantly, the world shifts. Sounds grow sharper—the chatter of people, the rustling of leaves, even the whispers of the wind seem to carry meaning. One voice stands out among the cacophony: “Follow the rhythm.”

Looking down, you realize the cobblestones beneath your feet are pulsing faintly, as if synchronized with some unseen heartbeat. Each step you take sends ripples across the ground, guiding you forward. Trusting the strange phenomenon, you begin to walk, matching your pace to the rhythm of the stones.

As you move, the city transforms subtly. Streets widen and narrow unpredictably; alleys twist into spirals before straightening again. People pass by, their faces blurring except for fleeting glimpses of emotion—hope, fear, determination—all mirroring your own feelings.

Finally, you arrive at the base of Lumina Tower. Its entrance is guarded by two massive doors carved with intricate designs of stars and constellations. As you reach out to touch them, the doors swing open silently, revealing a grand atrium bathed in golden light. At the center stands a figure waiting patiently, silhouetted against the brilliance.

“Welcome,” the figure says warmly. “We’ve been expecting you.”

And then you wake up, heart racing, unsure whether the dream was real—or if reality itself has begun to blur.
