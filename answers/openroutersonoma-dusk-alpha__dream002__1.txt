You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the first fat raindrops splatter against the canopy above, turning the air thick with the scent of wet earth and pine. Thunder rumbles in the distance like a giant's growl, and the wind whips through the trees, bending branches that claw at the sky. You quicken your pace, heart pounding, searching for shelter—a hollow under a massive oak, perhaps—but the path twists ahead into deepening shadows. Lightning cracks, illuminating a hidden glade where ancient stones form a circle, pulsing with an otherworldly glow. As the storm unleashes its fury, you step into the circle, and reality blurs: the rain becomes a cascade of stars, the thunder a chorus of whispers calling your name. You awaken, not in your bed, but still in the forest, the sun rising as if nothing happened—yet the stones remain, etched with symbols that feel strangely familiar.
