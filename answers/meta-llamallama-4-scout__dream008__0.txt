...feel a surge of panic as I look at the clock on my computer screen. The deadline is to have a comprehensive report finished in 30 minutes, which I know is impossible given the complexity of the project. My boss, Mr. Johnson, is standing over me, his arms crossed and a stern expression on his face.

"Alright, I expect to see a draft on my desk in 30 minutes," he says, his voice firm but with a hint of skepticism. "And it needs to be perfect. I want to see charts, graphs, and a detailed analysis of the data."

I nod, trying to appear confident, but my mind is racing. I have no idea where to start. I look around the office, hoping to find some inspiration or a miracle solution, but everyone else seems to be working normally, oblivious to the crisis unfolding at my desk.

As I begin to frantically type on my keyboard, my computer screen starts to glitch and distort. The words and numbers I type seem to swirl around on the screen, refusing to make sense. I try to shake off the feeling of unease, telling myself it's just a dream, but the sense of urgency and panic persists.

Suddenly, my chair starts to slide backwards, and I'm rolling across the office, still typing away on my keyboard. I'm careening out of control, dodging coworkers and leaping over obstacles. Mr. Johnson is chasing after me, shouting something about "meeting the deadline" and "delivering results."

I try to stop myself, but my chair keeps rolling, taking me on a wild journey through the office. I zoom past the water cooler, the conference room, and the break room, still typing away on my keyboard. The words and numbers on my screen are now a jumbled mess, but I feel a strange sense of freedom and exhilaration.

As I approach the office door, I see a giant clock looming over the hallway. The hands are spinning wildly, and the numbers are blurring together. I feel a rush of adrenaline as I realize I'm running out of time.

And then, everything goes white.
