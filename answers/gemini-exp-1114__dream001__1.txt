The city hums with a strange, electric energy. Buildings scrape the bruised-purple sky, their architecture a baffling blend of gothic spires and sleek, futuristic curves. Neon signs, flickering with indecipherable symbols, cast an alien glow on the slick, iridescent pavement. Panic, cold and sharp, pierces the dreamy haze. The meeting!  I glance at a holographic watch that materializes on my wrist – 59 minutes.

Where is it?  I don't even remember who I'm supposed to meet, just a bone-deep feeling of its monumental importance. Frantically, I search for any clue. My pockets are empty except for a single, smooth stone, warm to the touch, engraved with a symbol that looks like a spiral galaxy. Is this a clue?

People surge around me, a kaleidoscope of faces: some human, some with luminescent skin, others with multiple eyes that glitter like jewels. I try to ask for directions, but my voice comes out as a muted whisper. They glance at me, their expressions unreadable, and then drift away, swallowed by the crowd.

Desperate, I hold up the stone. A young woman with iridescent wings stops, her eyes widening as she sees it. She points towards a towering, obsidian structure in the distance, a monolithic needle piercing the heart of the city. "The Nexus," she whispers, her voice like wind chimes, "they await you there."  Then, with a flutter of wings, she vanishes into the crowd.

The Nexus. It feels right, a flicker of recognition igniting in my dream-addled mind. I break into a run, the cityscape blurring around me. The air grows thicker, charged with a strange energy that makes my skin tingle. As I approach the Nexus, the ground begins to vibrate faintly.

I reach the base of the obsidian tower, a massive, featureless door looming before me. No handle, no keyhole, just the same spiral galaxy symbol from the stone glowing faintly in its center. I press the stone against it. The symbol flares with blinding light, and the door slides open with a low, resonant hum.

Inside, a vast chamber stretches before me, illuminated by a soft, ethereal glow. In the center, a circular platform rises from the floor, and upon it stands... me. Or, rather, a version of me, clad in shimmering robes, radiating an aura of serene confidence.

"Welcome," this other me says, their voice echoing through the chamber, "You are right on time."

The dream shimmers, then fades, leaving me with a lingering sense of awe, and the question – who was I meeting?  And was it truly just a dream?  The smooth stone lies on my nightstand, warm to the touch, the faint outline of a spiral galaxy still visible in the morning light.
