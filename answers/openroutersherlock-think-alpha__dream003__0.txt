symbols that pulse with an otherworldly glow, shifting like living tattoos under your fingertips. The patterns whisper secrets in a language you half-remember from childhood nightmares—ancient runes that twist into shapes of forgotten gods and spiraling galaxies.

Curiosity overrides caution. You press your palm against the cool metal, and a jolt of electric warmth surges through you, syncing your heartbeat to the box's rhythmic hum. The lock clicks without a key, the lid creaking open on hinges that sigh like wind through autumn leaves.

Inside, no treasure gleams—no gold, no jewels. Instead, a swirling vortex of liquid starlight swirls in a crystal vial, suspended in mid-air. It beckons, promising answers to questions you never knew to ask. You reach in, fingers brushing the cool shimmer, and the world dissolves.

Colors explode behind your eyes: forests of crystal trees where birds sing symphonies in binary code, oceans of ink that write your future on waves, and a mirror version of yourself grinning mischievously from the shadows, holding an identical box.

"You've only just begun," mirror-you laughs, voice echoing like thunder in your chest. The vial shatters in your grasp, flooding your veins with liquid dreams. You soar through nebulae, tasting infinity, until—

Your alarm blares. You jolt awake, sheets tangled, the echo of that hum still vibrating in your bones. On your nightstand? A small, ornate box, patterns faintly glowing. No lock in sight.
