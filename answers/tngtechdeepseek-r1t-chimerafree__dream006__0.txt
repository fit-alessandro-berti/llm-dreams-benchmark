As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak. At first, your voice wavers, and your palms grow clammy as you fumble with your notes. But then, a warm spotlight envelops you, and you lock eyes with a kind-faced stranger nodding encouragingly. Their quiet confidence anchors you. 

Slowly, your words gain momentum, flowing like a river you didn’t know existed within you. The audience leans in, their collective energy lifting you. You speak of ideas that feel both foreign and familiar, as if the dream itself is weaving the speech through you. By the end, the room vibrates with applause, but it’s the profound sense of connection—to the crowd, to yourself—that lingers. 

You wake with a start, heart racing, but the echo of that unseen courage stays with you long after the dream fades.
