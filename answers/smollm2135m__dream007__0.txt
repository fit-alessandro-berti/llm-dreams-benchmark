As I stand on the ground holding my partner, I feel like I am walking through a storm. My partner, Rachel, sits down across from me, fidgeting with her hands as if trying to make sense of the conflict raging inside her head. "I thought it was really important to us," Rachel says softly, her voice barely above a whisper. My eyes fill with anger and tears, reminding me that this friendship is not just about our relationship or my feelings, but also about being a supportive friend to my family and friends who live far away.

Just as the fight seems intense, I catch myself, and we begin to laugh together, breaking down old grudges like I used to do when they were younger. Rachel smiles, feeling defeated at times, her shoulders relaxed behind her, while I struggle with deep-seated anger stemming from past interactions too long gone by.

Suddenly, Rachel leans in close, her voice husky and confident as she talks aloud. "It's okay to not feel like everything is going according to plan just yet," she says finally, "but you're two people that I love so much."

I'm immediately drained of emotion at the moment we both exchange that deep gasp of air on the edge of our voices. My heart leans across from Rachel's, and tears flood my eyes, though they manage to trickle back down only because she laughed so hard. Despite being angry myself, I realize that in our hearts lies a love that transcends past wounds and hurts. We've come together like two lovers embracing each other in the moment, one at a time, holding hands close for dear life.
