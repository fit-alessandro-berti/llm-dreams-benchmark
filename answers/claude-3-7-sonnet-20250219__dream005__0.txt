You are dreaming. I'll continue this dream scenario for you:

You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and find yourself drifting between conversations like a ghost. The faces around you seem to shift subtly when you're not looking directly at them.

In one corner, a group discusses something with intense focus, their voices dropping to whispers whenever you approach. You catch fragments about "the coming change" and "those who will remember."

The architecture of the building begins to feel wrong - hallways that should connect don't, and doors open to unexpected places. The ceiling seems higher than before, almost impossibly so.

You spot someone who looks like your friend from behind, but when they turn, their face is blank and featureless for a split second before resolving into the face of a stranger who smiles too widely and asks, "Have we met before? I'm certain we have, in another place."

The lighting flickers, and suddenly the crowd parts. Across the room stands your friend, finally! But as you move toward them, the distance between you seems to stretch. People move into your path with perfect timing to block you, as if choreographed.

A hand touches your shoulder. An elderly person you don't recognize leans in and whispers, "You're looking in the wrong places. They're not here anymore. None of us are."

The music changes to a melody you recognize from childhood but can't quite name. The walls begin to breathe.
