...and increasingly surreal obstacles that blur the line between professional skill and your deepest subconscious fears.

The penultimate round takes place in a boardroom that has no floor, only a thick layer of morning mist. You are handed a fountain pen made of ice and told to "draft a contract with the wind." Your opponent is a version of yourself from ten years ago, who looks at you with pity because you’ve forgotten how to whistle. You manage to finish the task by writing in the air, the letters hanging like frost before drifting away.

Finally, you are led to the top floor. The CEO is a giant clockwork owl whose ticking echoes in your chest. The owl doesn't ask for your resume; instead, it asks you to describe the exact color of a Monday morning. 

As you speak, the walls of the office begin to dissolve. The mahogany desks turn into rows of blooming lavender, and the fluorescent lights stretch into beams of setting sunlight. You realize the "dream job" isn't an office or a title—it’s the role of **The Weaver of Horizons.** Your task is to paint the line where the sky meets the earth every evening.

Just as the owl leans in to hand you the Golden Key to the horizon, you feel a strange vibration. The sky begins to ripple like water. You realize the "competition" was never about beating others, but about remembering what you actually wanted before you learned to be busy.

The owl blinks, its golden eyes reflecting your own face, and whispers: *"You’ve always been hired. You just kept forgetting to show up."*

The floor drops away, and you aren't falling—you’re flying. The job starts now. You reach out to touch the sunset, and your fingers feel the warmth of a real sun, just as the edges of the room begin to fade into the sound of your alarm clock.
