You feel the air thicken, charged with static that makes your hair stand on end. The sky fractures with a bolt of violet lightning, revealing a gnarled oak ahead, its branches twisting into a skeletal arch. As rain begins to fall—each drop shimmering like liquid silver—the wind carves words into the mud at your feet: *“Beneath the roots, the storm is born.”*  

Compelled, you kneel and claw at the earth until your fingers brush cold iron. A buried key emerges, etched with runes that pulse in time with the thunder. The oak groans, its trunk splitting to expose a doorway veiled in twilight. Beyond it, a vast, inverted sea churns overhead, waves crashing against a shore of stars. A figure stands there, neither human nor shadow, holding a lantern filled with captured lightning.  

“You’ve always known the storm,” it whispers, its voice the creak of ancient timber. “Why fear your own tempest?”  

The ground dissolves. You fall upward into the sea, breathless, as the storm floods your lungs—not with water, but with a wild, electric clarity. When you jolt awake, the taste of ozone lingers, and somewhere, deep in your chest, the low rumble of thunder answers when you blink.
