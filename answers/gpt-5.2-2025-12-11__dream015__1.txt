You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **keep walking—toward the city’s broken skyline, where the clouds look stitched together and the air tastes faintly of metal**.

The road is a ribbon of cracked asphalt, threaded with weeds that move as if they’re breathing. Every step crunches glass that has long since lost its shine. Your pack is too light for comfort: a half-empty canteen, a battered flashlight, a coil of wire, and a notebook whose pages are mostly blank but somehow heavy with promise.

You pass the husk of a neighborhood where wind has learned to speak through open windows. A child’s bicycle lies on its side, its front wheel still turning slowly, like it didn’t get the memo that time ended. Somewhere deeper in the houses, something clicks—once, twice—like a tongue against teeth.

You freeze.

A shadow slips between doorframes. Not a person. Not quite an animal. It moves with the certainty of hunger and the caution of something that has survived too long. Your heartbeat becomes the loudest thing in the world.

You step off the road and into the weeds. They part for you in a way that feels like recognition.

At the edge of the neighborhood is a small storefront with a faded sign: **MERCY PHARMACY**. The glass doors are shattered, but the security gate is half-lowered, jammed in place. You duck under it, feeling the metal’s cold kiss on your back.

Inside, dust hangs in the air like suspended snowfall. Shelves stand stripped and crooked, but your flashlight beam catches a glint: a row of amber bottles behind the counter, hidden beneath a collapsed display. Your hands move before your mind does—pulling, sorting, reading labels that don’t mean much until you see one that does.

Antibiotics.

In this world, that’s a treasure. Not just for you—*for anyone*.

A sound outside: the soft drag of something patient. You kill the light and hold your breath. Through the broken front window, the street is a smear of moonlit gray. The shadow is there now, closer, taller than it looked before, its outline flickering as if it can’t decide what shape to wear.

It pauses, tilting toward the pharmacy.

Your mind rummages through panic and finds a thin, sharp plan. You pull the coil of wire from your pack and hook it to the loose gate. Quietly, carefully, you thread it through the gap and around a rusted shelf leg. The gate is heavy, but it wants to fall. It wants to slam shut.

You take a small pebble from your pocket—something you’ve been holding onto without remembering why—and toss it down the aisle.

*Tick.*

The sound is tiny, but in the silence it’s a shout.

The shadow turns toward it, drifting in through the broken doors, eager and wrong. It glides past the counter, following the pebble’s echo like a scent.

You pull the wire.

The security gate drops with a metallic crash that rings in your teeth. The shadow recoils, slamming into the bars, and for a split second you see it clearly: a face that isn’t a face, a suggestion of eyes where eyes should not be, like darkness trying to imitate a person.

It shrieks—not loud, but *inside you*, a pressure behind your eyes. You stagger, biting down on your own fear as if it’s something you can chew and swallow.

But the gate holds. The wire holds.

You don’t wait to see what it does next.

You sprint out the back, into an alley that smells of rain that never arrives. Your lungs burn. Your boots splash through a puddle that shouldn’t exist in this dry, dead place—except the water is there, reflecting a sky that is *not* the one above you.

You stop.

The puddle is too dark, too clean. In it, you see a city that isn’t ruined—lights glowing, windows intact, people moving in little fast-forward blurs. A world that kept going without you.

Your reflection leans closer than you do.

It mouths words you can’t hear.

Then the notebook in your pack thumps, as if someone knocked on it from the inside.

You pull it out with shaking hands. The blank pages are no longer blank. A map has appeared—drawn in ink so fresh it shines. At the top, in careful handwriting that looks disturbingly like yours, are three words:

**“YOU ARE LATE.”**

A red circle marks a place beyond the city, far past where the road should end. Next to it is a symbol you’ve never seen but somehow recognize: a simple door, drawn slightly ajar.

Behind you, from the direction of the pharmacy, metal groans. The gate is being pushed. Slowly. Persistently. Like the world itself is leaning.

You look back at the puddle. In its surface, the intact city brightens as if someone turned up the exposure. A siren wails in that reflected world, muffled, far away. A crowd scatters—tiny, soundless.

And then one of them stops and looks straight into the puddle.

Straight at you.

They raise a hand, palm pressed to the other side of the reflection, as if the water is glass. Their mouth forms a single word you can read perfectly:

**“RUN.”**

You don’t ask where. You don’t ask why.

You tighten your grip on the notebook, feel the weight of the antibiotics against your ribs, and start moving toward the place circled in red—toward the drawn door, toward whatever is waiting beyond the city’s bones.

As you run, the weeds lean away to make a path.

And in the distance, somewhere between the broken skyline and the wrong, stitched-together clouds, a real door creaks open—slowly, politely—like it’s been expecting you all along.
