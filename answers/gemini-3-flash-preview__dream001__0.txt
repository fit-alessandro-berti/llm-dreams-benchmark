You start to run, but your legs feel heavy, as if the air has thickened into the consistency of cold honey. Every stride requires an immense effort of will. The city around you is a labyrinth of impossible geometry; skyscrapers lean inward at precarious angles, their windows reflecting a sky that is the color of a bruised plum, flickering with silent, green lightning.

You reach into your pocket for your phone, desperate to find an address or a calendar invite, but the device feels soft, like a piece of warm taffy. When you tap the screen, the icons slide off the edge and vanish. The time on the display reads **88:96**, and the numbers are slowly melting.

Panic pricks at your chest. You stop a passerby—a tall figure in a coat made of moth wings—and try to ask for directions. "The meeting," you gasp, "I’m late for the meeting." 

The stranger turns, but where their face should be, there is only a circular mirror reflecting your own anxious eyes. "The meeting is always in the Room of Whispers," they reply, their voice sounding like dry leaves skittering across pavement. They point toward a bridge that wasn't there a moment ago, a shimmering span of glass that arches over a river of liquid silver.

As you step onto the bridge, the city sounds begin to fade, replaced by a low, rhythmic humming that vibrates in your teeth. You realize the "meeting" isn't with people at all. You look down at your hands and see they are beginning to turn translucent, revealing glowing circuits beneath your skin. 

The hour is almost up. You aren't looking for a room anymore; you are looking for the door at the end of the world, and as you reach the center of the bridge, the glass beneath your feet begins to dissolve into light. 

You aren't falling. You are waking up.
