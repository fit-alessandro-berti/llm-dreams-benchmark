...feel a surge of panic rising in your chest. The stack of files on your desk seems to grow taller, and the clock on the wall ticks with an unnerving loudness. You know there's no way a human could finish this in time. The weight of your boss's expectant gaze is a physical pressure.

But then, a strange calm washes over you. This is a dream, after all. The rules are different here.

You take a deep breath, smile at your boss, and say, "I have it handled."

You turn to your computer. Instead of opening a spreadsheet, your fingers fly across the keyboard, not typing, but composing, as if writing a symphony of code and ideas. The monitor doesn't display documents but a swirling vortex of light and information. You are not *working* on the project; you are *manifesting* it.

Tasks complete themselves. Reports write themselves in perfect prose. Emails are sent before you even think of the recipients. The impossible deadline isn't a barrier; it's simply the tempo to which the dream now moves. You are a conductor, and reality is your orchestra.

Your boss watches, their stern expression melting into one of awe. They aren't just seeing a project get done; they are witnessing a kind of magic.

You finish. The air stills. The project is not just complete, but it is perfect, visionary, beyond anything that was asked for.

You look up and say, "Is there anything else?"

And as you say it, you wake up.
