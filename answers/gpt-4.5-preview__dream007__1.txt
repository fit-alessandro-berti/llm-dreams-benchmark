take a deep breath and pause, suddenly realizing that something feels out of place. Instead of becoming angrier, you calmly say to your friend, "Wait, do you notice anything strange here?"

Your friend pauses, puzzled. As their expression softens, the tension begins to dissolve. You both suddenly notice you are standing on an open beach at twilight, the waves quietly rolling toward your feet. Neither of you recall how this argument started or how you arrived on this beach, yet it somehow feels natural.

Looking upward, you see luminous stars swirling slowly across the unfamiliar yet calming sky. Turning back to your friend, you say, "I think we're dreaming. Perhaps this argument wasn't as important as we believed."

Your friend nods thoughtfully, a smile beginning to form. Together you decide to leave the disagreement behind, choosing instead to explore this peaceful shoreline. A gentle wind whispers reassurance as you move together toward the tranquil horizon, the dream gradually dissolving into something warm and comforting.
