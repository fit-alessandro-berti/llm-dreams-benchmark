**Dream Completion:**

You decide to follow the faint hum of a radio signal, a static-laced whisper promising sanctuary. The journey leads you through skeletal forests and over highways choked with rusted carcasses of cars. Days blur into nights, each step a battle against hunger and paranoia. 

Near the outskirts of a crumbling city, you encounter a child, their eyes sharp with survival instinct. They offer a deal: *“Help me reach the old library, and I’ll show you where the water flows.”* Trust is a currency rarer than gold here, but desperation binds you. 

Inside the library’s decaying husk, you uncover not just rainwater collectors, but a mural etched by survivors long gone—a map to an underground greenhouse, its existence defying the barren world above. But the child’s true motive surfaces: they’re being hunted by a faction that hoards the greenhouse’s bounty. 

Now, a choice: abandon the child to claim the oasis for yourself, or risk everything to ignite a spark of rebellion. As you weigh survival against hope, the radio crackles to life again—a new voice, urgent, repeating coordinates. Somewhere, others are fighting to rebuild. 

The dream fades as you step into the greenhouse, sunlight filtering through fractured glass onto green shoots. Even in decay, life persists.
