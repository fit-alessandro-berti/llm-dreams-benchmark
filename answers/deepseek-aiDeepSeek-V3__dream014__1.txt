...feel a surge of relief and gratitude. The strangers, each with warm smiles and welcoming eyes, introduce themselves and immediately seem to sense your unease. They guide you through the maze of crowded streets, their voices soothing and their presence comforting. 

As you walk, the city transforms around you—no longer chaotic and overwhelming, but alive with vibrant colors and harmonious sounds. The strangers share stories, laughter, and wisdom, making you feel like you’ve known them forever. They take you to a quiet park, where a large, ancient tree stands in the center. 

One of the strangers steps forward and says, “This tree has been here for centuries. It’s a place of refuge for anyone who feels lost. Take a moment here.” 

You sit beneath the tree, its roots grounding you and its branches offering shelter. You close your eyes and breathe deeply, feeling a profound sense of peace and belonging. When you open your eyes, the strangers are gone, but a small, intricately carved key rests in your hand. 

Somehow, you know this key will guide you to where you need to be. You stand up, no longer feeling lost or alone, and walk confidently back into the city, ready to embrace whatever comes next.
