# The Box of Whispers

You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and symbols etched across its dark wooden surface. The patterns seem to shift subtly when you're not looking directly at them, like ripples across water.

When you run your fingers over the engravings, they feel warm to the touch. A faint humming emanates from within the box, almost like a distant melody. As you press your ear against it, the humming transforms into whispers—too quiet to understand, yet somehow familiar.
