**The Storm’s Whisper**

The air grows thick, heavy with the scent of damp earth and ozone. The trees, once swaying gently in the breeze, now stand rigid, their leaves trembling like fingers warning you. A low, guttural rumble builds in the distance—less thunder than something *older*, something that remembers the forest’s secrets.

Then, the first drop hits your cheek. Not rain. *Teardrops.* Warm and silver, they fall from the sky in slow, deliberate arcs, as if the clouds themselves are weeping. You reach up, and your fingers brush against one—it dissolves into mist, leaving your skin tingling. The ground beneath you softens, the moss swelling with unseen moisture, the roots of the ancient oaks pulsing like veins.

The wind howls, but it doesn’t push you—it *pulls*. You’re drawn toward a clearing where the storm hasn’t yet arrived, where the light still clings like a last breath. At the center stands a figure: a woman woven from vines and starlight, her eyes two deep pools reflecting the coming tempest. She holds out a hand—not in greeting, but in offering.

*"You’ve been waiting for this,"* she murmurs, her voice like wind through reeds. *"The storm isn’t coming for the forest. It’s coming for you."*

Behind her, the sky splits open. Not with lightning, but with *doors*—fractures in the fabric of the dream, revealing glimpses of other worlds:
- A city of floating islands where people trade in memories instead of gold.
- A desert where the dunes sing in a language that unravels your name.
- A mirror-lake reflecting not your face, but the face of someone you’ve never met—someone who smiles when you blink.

The woman’s fingers brush your wrist, and suddenly, you’re *falling*—not down, but *into*. The storm swallows you whole, and for the first time, you don’t fight it. You let the wind carry you, because you realize:

You’ve been dreaming of this your whole life.

**What happens next?**
- Do you step through one of the doors?
- Does the woman reveal a truth about your waking life?
- Or does the storm *change* you—leaving you with a new sense, a new fear, or a new purpose?
