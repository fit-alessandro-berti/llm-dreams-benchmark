take a step back and breathe deeply. You realize that raising your voice isn't going to resolve anything. Instead, you suggest taking a short break to cool off, proposing that you both return to the conversation when you're calmer. During the break, you reflect on why this issue is so important to you and try to understand your friend's perspective. When you reconvene, you start by acknowledging your friend’s feelings and expressing your own more calmly. This shift in approach helps to de-escalate the tension, and you both begin to listen more openly. Through this more constructive dialogue, you find common ground and work towards a compromise that respects both of your values and concerns. The experience, while challenging, strengthens your friendship and improves your ability to handle conflicts in the future.
