…a brush made of mist floats into your hand, its bristles dripping with light. You lift it toward the blank canvas, and before you even touch it, the surface ripples like water. Each stroke you imagine blooms into something unexpected — a mountain that becomes a bird, a river that turns into laughter, a sky stitched with spinning clocks.

As you paint, the colors leak out of the canvas and into the air, tinting the world around you. The ground beneath your feet shifts from checkerboard to sand to soft moss. The shapes of trees melt into spirals, then reassemble as doorways. You step through one and find yourself inside your own painting, walking between luminous brushstrokes that hum like distant music.

A whisper in the wind tells you that the canvas was never blank; it was waiting for you to remember the dream you came to finish. You dip the brush into a pool of starlight and write a final line across the sky. The words dissolve into a flock of glowing birds that scatter in every direction, and as they fly, the world pauses—silent, radiant, complete—before fading softly into the next dream.
