...familiar faces from your past, some you haven't seen in years. A high school teacher who once encouraged you, a college roommate you lost touch with, a coworker from your first job. They all smile warmly, inviting you into their circles, but you politely excuse yourself. You have a mission: find your person.

The crowd thickens, the murmur of conversations swelling into a dull roar that seems to pulse with the rhythm of your own heartbeat. The air grows heavy with the scent of perfume, wine, and the salty tang of hors d'oeuvres. You push through a cluster of people laughing uproariously at a story you can't hear, their faces blurring into a mosaic of open mouths and glittering eyes.

Suddenly, you see a flash of a familiar color—the exact shade of deep blue they always wear. You maneuver quickly, your heart lifting, only to find a stranger adjusting a blue scarf. Disappointment is a cold stone in your stomach.

Turning a corner near a long table laden with food, you finally see them. They are standing by a grand fireplace, slightly apart from a group, staring into the flames. Their posture is not one of peaceful solitude, but of deep contemplation, perhaps even unease. A wave of relief washes over you, so potent it makes the dream-sharp edges of the room soften for a second.

You call their name.

They turn. But their face is wrong. It's smoothed of all its familiar lines and scars, a generic, placid mask. Their eyes don't light up in recognition. They look at you as they would look at any other guest—with polite, blank curiosity.

"You must be mistaken," they say, their voice sounding distant, like a recording. "I don't believe we've met."

And as the words land, the entire dream shifts. The lively social gathering falls into a dead, suffocating silence. The hundreds of guests stop their conversations in unison and turn to look at you. Their faces have all melted into the same smooth, featureless mask. A sea of polite, identical strangers, all waiting for you to explain yourself.
