...find a way to understand where—or *when*—you are. The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth. People pass by in rough-spun clothes, speaking a dialect that’s just familiar enough to tug at your memory, but not quite enough to follow. A blacksmith pounds iron nearby, the rhythm steady, hypnotic. You pat your pockets—no phone, no wallet, not even a watch. Just a small coin you don’t recognize and a name tag sewn into your coat: *Elia.*

You realize you need to blend in—fast. One misplaced word, one clueless reaction, and you could be labeled a fool… or worse, a threat. So you take a breath, straighten your posture, and step toward the marketplace, where a woman is selling loaves from a wooden cart. Maybe start with something simple: bread, water, a smile.

But deeper down, you know it’s not just about surviving the day. You need to figure out *why* you’re here—and whether this is a dream you can wake from… or a life you’re meant to live.

(What do you do next?)
