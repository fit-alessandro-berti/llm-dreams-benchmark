The wind begins to howl through the trees, bending their branches like bowing giants. The once-gentle rustling of leaves turns into a frantic, whispering chorus—almost as if the forest itself is warning you. The sky darkens in an instant, not with the slow creep of dusk, but with the sudden, suffocating weight of a storm that wasn’t there moments ago. The air grows thick, charged with the scent of ozone and damp earth, and the first fat raindrops splatter against your skin like scattered coins.

You quicken your pace, but the path beneath your feet is already turning to mud, slick and treacherous. Lightning splits the sky—not in the distance, but *right above you*, a jagged, blinding fork that illuminates the forest in stark, unnatural white. The thunder follows immediately, a deafening crack that vibrates in your bones. The trees around you seem to lean in, their gnarled roots shifting beneath the soil as if alive.

Then, you hear it: a sound that doesn’t belong. Not the patter of rain, not the groan of wind—something *else*. A low, rhythmic *thumping*, like a heartbeat, or the slow, deliberate steps of something massive moving just beyond the tree line. Your breath comes faster. The storm is no longer just a storm. It’s a *presence*.

A shadow detaches itself from the darkness between the trees. Tall. Too tall. Its form is indistinct, shifting like smoke, but its eyes—if they are eyes—glow faintly, like embers in the storm’s gloom. It doesn’t move toward you. Not yet. It just *watches*, as if waiting for you to make the next move.

And then, from the depths of the forest, a voice—soft, almost amused—whispers on the wind:

*"You shouldn’t have come here."*

The rain turns to hail. The trees begin to *scream*.

What do you do?
