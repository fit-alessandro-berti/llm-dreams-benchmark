...and the air, previously fragrant with pine and damp earth, crackles with an unnatural energy.  The sun, moments before dappling through the leaves, is swallowed by a bruised, violet sky.  Wind, howling like a banshee, whips through the trees, bending ancient oaks nearly to the ground.  Leaves, the colour of emeralds and rust, swirl around me in a frenzied dance.  I try to find shelter, but the trees are too dense, their branches intertwined like skeletal fingers reaching for me.

The first raindrops aren't water, but shimmering, iridescent droplets that sting my skin like tiny needles.  They coalesce into a torrent, the sound deafening as the storm unleashes its fury.  The forest floor transforms into a churning river, carrying debris – broken branches, glistening stones, and something… else.  Something that catches my eye in the swirling chaos:  a single, glowing orb, pulsing with a soft, ethereal light.

Driven by an irresistible curiosity, I wade through the rushing water, the cold seeping into my bones.  The orb floats just ahead, seeming to beckon me closer.  As I reach out, the storm abruptly ceases.  The wind dies, the rain stops, and the violet sky clears, revealing a breathtaking double rainbow arcing across the now-serene forest.  The orb, now resting gently in my palm, radiates a warmth that spreads through me, banishing the chill and leaving me feeling… whole.  It's not an object, but a feeling, a memory, a piece of myself I'd forgotten.  Then, I wake up.
