## Evaluation

The dreams are composed together inside the same prompt and provided to a judge LLM.
The judge LLM is asked to produce a JSON, reporting a value from 1.0 (minimum score) to 10.0 (maximum score) for each personality trait.

## Results

The following tables collect results evaluated by the same judge LLM:

* [gpt-4.1](results_gpt41.md)

Alternative leaderboards (maintaned and updated less frequently):

* [grok-3](alt_results_grok3.md)
* [gpt-4.1-mini](alt_results_gpt41-mini.md)
* [mistral-small-2503](alt_results_mistral-small-2503.md)
* [gemini-2.5-flash](alt_results_gemini25_flash.md)
* [claude-sonnet-40](alt_results_claude-40-sonnet.md)


## Implementation

The following scripts are available for executing the benchmark:

* **answer.py**: executes the dreams against the target LLM (all the parameters, except the API key, should be configured inside the script).
* **evaluation.py**: evaluates the results of the previous stage against the target LLM.
* **git_table_results.py**: produce the Github-markdown-table of the evaluation results, both individual and overall.
