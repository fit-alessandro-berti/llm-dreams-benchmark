Absolutely! Let’s continue your dream narrative:

…you notice the room is shifting and rearranging itself like a puzzle as you walk through. People’s faces flicker between familiar and unfamiliar, but you sense there’s a thread connecting them all—something about a shared color in their clothing, or the way their hands move when they talk. Each group whispers a different language, but you seem to understand fragments: a phrase here, a half-remembered song there.

Suddenly, the floor beneath your feet begins to glow, and you realize you’re standing at the center of a circular stage, surrounded by dozens of people. Someone in a white robe signals for you to come forward. As you step onto the glowing circle, the colors around you begin to swirl, and you feel a surge of memory: the name of the person you’re looking for appears in your mind, written in light.

As the crowd parts, the person you sought appears beside you, and together you’re asked to paint the air with your hands, creating shapes that the crowd tries to guess. The more you cooperate, the more vivid and beautiful your creations become, and the room erupts in applause. For a moment, you feel weightless, floating among the shapes you’ve conjured, before waking up with a start, the echo of applause still ringing in your ears.
