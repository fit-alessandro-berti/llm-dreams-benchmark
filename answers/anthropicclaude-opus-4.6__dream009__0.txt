# The Dream

I wake up with my cheek pressed against cold, damp stone.

The air smells wrong — smoke and earth and something animal. I sit up slowly, and my hands find rough-woven wool where my sheets should be. Through a narrow window slit, pale dawn light falls across a dirt floor scattered with rushes.

*This isn't my room.*

I stand, unsteady, and peer through the opening. Below me stretches a muddy village — thatched roofs, a well, chickens scratching between timber-framed houses. Beyond the low wall, fields roll toward a dark treeline. Somewhere, a blacksmith's hammer rings out in steady, ancient rhythm.

I realize I need to **find water.**

Not the philosophical kind of need. The desperate, throat-cracking, immediate kind. My mouth tastes like dust and iron. I stumble down a winding stone staircase — I've been sleeping in some kind of tower — and push open a heavy oak door.

The village turns to look at me.

A woman carrying a basket stops mid-step. A boy leading a goat stares openly. They're speaking something — not quite English, but close enough that I catch fragments. *Stranger. Tower. The sick one.*

**The sick one.** They think I'm someone. Someone who was already here before I arrived in this body.

An older man approaches cautiously, presses a clay cup of water into my hands, and speaks slowly, watching my face for recognition.

"The fever has broken, then," he says. "Good. Because the riders were seen at dawn beyond the ridge." His jaw tightens. "And you're the only one who knows the way through the marsh."

I drink the water. It tastes like minerals and life.

I don't know the way through the marsh. I don't know who I was before I woke up here. But everyone is looking at me with something I recognize across any century — 

**Hope.**

So I set down the cup, straighten the stranger's clothes on my body, and say the only thing I can:

"Show me the ridge."

As we walk toward the village edge, I notice something strange — a faint humming beneath my feet, like the ground itself remembers a song. And in my borrowed memories, just at the edge of reach, something flickers: tall grasses, black water, a path marked by stones that only appear under moonlight.

Maybe I *do* know the way.

Maybe that's why the dream brought me here.

The boy with the goat falls into step beside me, and the morning opens wide and terrifying ahead, and I have never felt more *awake* than in this place where I am completely, impossibly

asleep.
