...not in any language you recognize. The symbols on the page shift and writhe, like ink dropped in water. A low hum fills the room, but when you look up, your classmates are all writing furiously, as if they see a perfectly normal test.

Your heart begins to pound. You squint, and for a moment, the first question resolves into clarity:

**"Question 1: What is the weight of your regret?"**

The words are clear, but the question is impossible. You glance at the second question, which now reads:

**"Question 2: Describe the color of silence."**

Panic rises in your throat. You look around for the professor, but the room has no door. The walls are lined with bookshelves, but the books have no titles. The clock on the wall has no numbers, only a single, slow-moving hand.

You grip your pencil, and as you do, you realize it's not a pencil at all, but an old, rusty key. The key feels cold and heavy in your hand. The exam paper is no longer on the desk; it's a large, ornate wooden door, set into the frame of the desk. The key in your hand seems to be the exact size for the lock.

You have a choice: do you insert the key and open the door, or do you try to wake yourself up?

The dream holds its breath, waiting for your decision.
