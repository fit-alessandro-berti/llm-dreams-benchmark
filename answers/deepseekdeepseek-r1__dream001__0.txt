You start to run, the city’s labyrinthine streets twisting and morphing around you. Neon signs flicker in languages you don’t recognize; skyscrapers tilt at impossible angles, their reflections warping in rain-slicked pavement. A shrill ringtone pierces the air—your phone buzzes with a notification: *"Meeting location: The Nexus. Follow the crows."*  

You glance up. Black birds spiral overhead, their wings cutting through the smog like ink strokes. You chase them, dodging faceless crowds and leaping over canals filled with liquid starlight. Time distorts—clocks on towers spin backward, yet your watch insists *45 minutes remain*.  

At a dead end, a woman materializes from a graffiti mural, her eyes glowing like fractured glass. She hands you a key shaped like an hourglass. “The door is everywhere,” she whispers, vanishing. Desperate, you press the key to a brick wall. It dissolves, revealing an elevator humming with static.  

Inside, buttons labeled *Regret*, *Ambition*, and *Now* glow faintly. You slam *Now*. The doors open to a glass chamber suspended above the city. A dozen versions of yourself sit at a table, each holding a file stamped *CHOOSE*. The oldest you stands, smiling. “You’re late. But you’re here. So—what’s next?”  

The dream dissolves as you reach for the file… but not before you glimpse the title: *Your Life, Draft 23*.  

When you wake, the urgency lingers. But the city? The crows? They feel closer than ever.
