...start to panic, the city folding around you like a living map that keeps shifting. Towering spires of blue glass hum with low, melodic frequencies, their surfaces crawling with glowing, iridescent vines that pulse like veins. The streets aren’t paved with concrete, but with smooth, obsidian tiles that feel warm under your bare feet, humming faintly with energy. People move past you in slow motion, their faces obscured by shifting, translucent masks that display constellations or fleeting memories in flickering light.

You check your watch – the time *bends*. It reads 11:59, then 1:01, then 12:59 again, the numbers dissolving like ink in water. *One hour, but the city doesn't keep time.* You need to find the meeting. *But where?*

You run, not knowing where you’re going, adrenaline turning the air thick and syrupy. The buildings lean inward, whispering in languages you don’t know but somehow understand: *"Lost is the path you seek. The city remembers only the moment it sees."* A street sign flickers on a wall: *Chamber of Echoing Names.* You sprint towards it.

The door is a massive, intricately carved archway made of frozen music – shimmering silver notes suspended in mid-air. As you pass through, the air changes. It’s colder, quieter. Inside, the chamber is vast and empty except for a single, ancient stone table in the center. On it rests a small, ornate box covered in moss and tiny, flickering stars. A note is pinned to it in delicate, looping script:

> *"The meeting is not a place, but a moment of recognition. Seek the face that matches your own in the mirror of forgetting. Enter the clock that dreams."*

Below the note, a single, perfect key lies on the table – not metal, but shaped from solidified moonlight. You pick it up. It’s cold, yet it pulses faintly, like a heartbeat. The box feels warm.

A low chime sounds. From the far end of the chamber, a giant, fractured mirror appears. It doesn’t reflect you. Instead, it shows a version of you – younger, older, terrified, calm – flickering rapidly, like a film reel playing in reverse. Each reflection holds a different memory of a meeting, a promise, a moment of failure or triumph.

You realize: this isn't about *finding* a location. The city *is* the meeting. The key unlocks the moment you’re meant to recognize, the choice you haven’t made yet, the truth you’re avoiding.

You step towards the mirror, the moonlight key glowing brighter. The city outside shudders. The hum of the glass towers deepens. Time itself seems to hold its breath.

You raise the key... not to the mirror, but to your own chest. A single, clear note echoes through the chamber.

And suddenly, you *remember*: the meeting wasn't in this city. It was the conversation with yourself you’ve been avoiding for years. The clock that dreams... it’s the one inside you.

The mirror shatters. Not into glass, but into a thousand tiny lights that swirl into a single, brilliant point of understanding.

The city dissolves. The pressure lifts. You’re not running anymore.

You’re awake. But something in you is different. The meeting was always here.

You open your eyes. The room is calm. Your watch reads 12:00 precisely. And for the first time in years, you don’t feel lost.
