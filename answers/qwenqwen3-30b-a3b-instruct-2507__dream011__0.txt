...written in a language you’ve never seen before—twisting, flowing symbols that seem to pulse like living veins across the page. Your heart hammers against your ribs. You blink, and suddenly the symbols shift, rearranging themselves into a familiar script: *Mathematical proofs, quantum mechanics, ethics in AI.* Relief floods you—*you know this!* You grab your pencil, sweat beading on your forehead.

But as you begin, the answers you write vanish the moment you lift your hand. The page is blank again. You try again, more urgently, pouring out every equation, every insight, every memory of late-night study sessions. And each time, the paper erases itself—like a ghost trying to remember its own name.

Then, a whisper from the empty seat beside you:  
*"The exam isn’t the questions. It’s whether you still believe you can solve them."*

You look up. No one is there.  
But the final page appears—simple, clean, with only one line:  
**"What is the one thing you would never stop learning?"**

Your hand trembles. You don’t know if you’re failing.  
Or finally beginning.  
And then—  
You wake up gasping, your phone buzzing on the nightstand.  
It’s 6:30 a.m.  
The exam is tomorrow.  
But for the first time in months, you’re not afraid.  
You reach for your notebook… and start to write.
