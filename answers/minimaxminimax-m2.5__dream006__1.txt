# The Dream Continues

You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to feel the weight of a thousand eyes upon you—yet somehow, the feeling isn't fear, but something closer to *recognition*.

The lights are warm, like golden honey, bathing the audience in a soft glow. You grip the podium, and as you look out at the sea of faces, you notice something strange: every person seems to be someone you've never met, yet also someone you've always known. They are waiting—not for perfection, but for *you*.

You open your mouth to speak, and instead of words, what emerges is music—a melody so beautiful it seems to float through the air like ribbons of light. The audience leans forward, mesmerized. You realize in this dream that your voice has become an instrument, and the speech you're giving isn't about information at all—it's about *connection*.

As you continue, the stage beneath your feet begins to shift. It transforms into a vast garden, and the audience members are no longer seated—they're walking among flowers that bloom with every sentence you speak. Time loses meaning. You feel entirely present, entirely free.

Then, gently, you wake—leaving the garden behind, but carrying its flowers with you. 🌸
