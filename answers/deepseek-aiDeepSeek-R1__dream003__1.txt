**Dream Completion:**

As you examine the box closely, the intricate patterns seem to pulse with a faint, otherworldly glow. Your fingertips brush the carvings—a helix of vines, celestial constellations, and symbols you don’t recognize but *feel* deeply, like half-forgotten memories. Suddenly, the grooves beneath your touch warm, and the patterns shift, rearranging into a spiral that mirrors the birthmark on your wrist. A hum fills the air, resonant and ancient.  

Compelled, you press your palm to the center. The box clicks open, releasing a cascade of iridescent mist that coalesces into a shimmering key… only this one isn’t metal. It’s made of starlight and shadow, dissolving into your hand like liquid. A door you hadn’t noticed before materializes on the wall—a threshold veined with the same cryptic patterns.  

The key hums in sync with your heartbeat. You understand, without knowing how, that this isn’t about unlocking the box anymore. It’s about choosing: awaken now, or turn the key and step into the deeper dream, where the vines on the box writhe into bridges between worlds, and the constellations are maps to everything you’ve ever whispered to the dark.  

You reach for the door. The dream bends—*and so do you*.
