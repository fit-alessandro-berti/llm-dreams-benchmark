take a deep breath and pause. The air between you feels thick with tension, charged like the moment before a storm breaks. Your friend’s eyes are bright with frustration, their voice still ringing in your ears—*You just don’t get it*—but something shifts. Maybe it’s the way the late afternoon light slants through the window, turning the dust in the air golden, or the way their hands are clenched, knuckles white, like they’re holding onto more than just anger.

You soften your stance. *"You’re right,"* you say, and their expression flickers—confusion, then wariness, as if they’re bracing for a *but*. But you don’t give them one. Instead, you step closer, close enough to see the flecks of hazel in their irises, the way their breath hitches. *"I don’t get it. Not fully. But I want to. Tell me again—like I’m hearing it for the first time."*

Silence. The kind that hums. Then, slowly, their shoulders drop. They exhale, long and shaky, and for a second, you think they might cry. But instead, they laugh—a raw, disbelieving sound—and say, *"You’re such an asshole."* And you grin, because this is how it’s always been between you: fire and forgiveness, collisions that somehow leave you both standing.

They reach for the crumpled napkin on the table—the one with the half-drawn diagram of whatever impossible idea you’ve been fighting over—and smooth it out. *"Okay. Start here."* Their finger traces a line, and just like that, the argument isn’t an ending. It’s a door.

Outside, the storm finally breaks. Rain hammers the roof, but inside, the air is lighter. You realize, with a quiet thrill, that this is how things grow: not by one of you winning, but by both of you bending, just enough to let the light in.
