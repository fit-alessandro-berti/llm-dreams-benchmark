You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the sky darkens rapidly, with heavy clouds rolling in. The wind picks up, bending the trees and rustling the leaves violently. You start to run, seeking shelter, when you notice a small, ancient-looking cabin tucked away between the trees.

You rush towards the cabin, the rain beginning to pour down in torrents. You push open the creaky door and step inside, finding yourself in a cozy, dimly lit room. The cabin feels strangely familiar, as if you've been here before in another dream. There's a fireplace with a warm fire crackling, casting flickering shadows on the walls adorned with old photographs and maps.

As you take off your wet coat and hang it by the door, you hear a soft voice from the corner of the room. Turning, you see an elderly woman sitting in a rocking chair, knitting. She looks up at you with kind eyes and smiles.

"Welcome back," she says, as if she's been expecting you. "The storm can be fierce, but you're safe here."

You sit down on a comfortable chair near the fire, feeling the warmth seep into your bones. The woman continues to knit, the rhythmic sound soothing your nerves. Outside, the storm rages on, but inside the cabin, time seems to stand still.

As you relax, you start to feel a sense of déjà vu. The woman tells you stories of the forest and its secrets, tales of magic and adventure. You listen intently, feeling more connected to this place with every word.

Eventually, the storm begins to subside, and the woman stands up, walking over to a window. She pulls back the curtain, revealing a breathtaking view of the forest now bathed in the soft light of the setting sun.

"It's time for you to go," she says gently. "But remember, you can always find your way back here when you need to."

You nod, feeling a sense of gratitude and peace. You put on your coat, which is now dry, and step outside. The air is fresh and cool, and the forest is alive with the sounds of nature waking up after the storm.

As you walk away from the cabin, you feel a sense of renewal and clarity. You know that no matter where your dreams take you, this place will always be a sanctuary, waiting for your return.
