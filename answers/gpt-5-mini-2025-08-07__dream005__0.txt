…they all seem to fold around a single rhythm you can't place. A woman with silver hair is telling a story so old it smells of rain; when she laughs the light around her blinks like a lantern. Two men in too-bright shirts are arguing about colors until their words turn into paper boats that float away across the polished floor. A circle of children build a tower of clocks; every time they add a clock the hands reverse, and for a moment the whole room forgets what minute it was.

You slip between them, feeling like a secret on the edge of being told. Faces press past: some are familiar in the way a song can be familiar without you knowing the name, others are like pages torn from books you never read but somehow remember. One group speaks in quotation marks—every sentence they say is exactly what someone said once before; another group murmurs in the sound of rain on metal. A trio wears mirrors for faces and when you lean close each mirror shows a different year of your life all at once.

With every cluster you pass you catch a fragment of the person you are looking for. The way someone twists a paper napkin—your person's nervous habit. The scent of a sweater—your person's cologne and also sunlight. Laughter like a particular radio station. A pale scar on an elbow. It is as if they have left breadcrumbs of themselves all over the room and the breadcrumbs have turned into people.

Time is elastic here. A band in the corner plays a song backwards and the slow-motion notes glue the room together; you watch a spilled drink rise from the carpet and climb back into its glass. The ceiling lowers like a lid, then blooms upward as lanterns loosen themselves and fly like jellyfish. A group of dancers move in a circle so fast that their shadows untie themselves and run toward you, trailing silk ribbons. You reach out but the ribbons are actually words—small, plain words folded into language—and when you read them they say: i am here.

You follow that sentence until you find a quiet passage where the crowd thins and the light becomes honest and kind. Here people are fewer and everything speaks in a lower voice: a man tracing names on a map, a woman knitting a scarf from people's laughter, a boy polishing a key until it gleams. The key is small and feels like something you have always known but had forgotten the shape of. You think of doors, of closets in your childhood house, of the moment someone took your hand and taught you to whistle.

At the edge of this small constellation sits the one person you knew—only they are not a single shape. For a second they are older, their hair white and their laugh slow; for a second they are a child balancing a spoon on their nose; for a second they are exactly as you remember: the tilt of their chin, the scar at their eyebrow, the way they fold their hands when they're thinking. Their mouth opens and for a moment you expect a name. Instead they hand you a paper cup that smells like the night you first met them, and inside the cup is a slip of paper that reads nothing but your own name.

"Why did you hide?" you ask, as if the asking could rearrange the crowd.

They smile like a question you already know the answer to. "I never hid," they say. "I spread parts of myself to see which ones would recognize you." The words are soft, and around you people nod as if this is the most reasonable thing in the world. The woman with the silver hair hums a tune that matches the beat of your heart.

You realize then that you have been looking for a single person in a room full of echoes because you needed to know which echo would answer. Each group you passed was offering you something—memory, comfort, a mirror, a key—until you had enough to complete the shape of the person you knew. They are there, in all of it: in the clock tower's rewinding hands, in the paper boats, in the band playing your name. And in the small moment of recognition, the crowd rearranges itself into a corridor of hands leading to a door that belonged to your childhood house.

You take their hand. It's warm, callused in the same places, the fingerprints you drew on glass when you were small. The door opens onto a place that smells like peeled oranges and late afternoons. You step through with them and the gathering recedes into a memory of light—pleasant and indistinct—and you think, briefly and sweetly, that perhaps the person you were trying to find was never lost at all.

Then you wake, or you don't; the ceiling above you could just as well be sky, and somewhere far away somebody laughs in a voice that you finally recognize.
