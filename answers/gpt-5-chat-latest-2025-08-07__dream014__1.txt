…hesitate for a moment, unsure if you can trust them. But something in their eyes—warmth, familiarity—nudges you forward.  

They weave through the throng of hurried faces, guiding you down side streets you’ve never seen before. The noise of the city fades, replaced by the soft hum of distant music.  

Along the way, they tell you stories—tales of hidden gardens between skyscrapers, secret libraries beneath the subway, and doorways that only open when you smile sincerely. You feel lighter with every step, as if each word they speak lifts a weight from your chest.  

Finally, you arrive at a wide, quiet square bathed in golden light. In the center stands an ancient fountain, its water sparkling like stardust. The strangers turn to you and say, *“You’ve been here before… you just forgot the way.”*  

As you look into the fountain, your reflection ripples and changes, showing a version of you who seems utterly at peace. When you reach out to touch the water, the strangers vanish—but their kindness lingers, a steady glow in your heart.  

The city hum returns, but now the streets feel softer, the faces friendlier, as though the whole world has shifted toward something gentler. And you walk forward, knowing that even if you lose your way again, kindness will find you.

If you’d like, I can rewrite this dream in a surreal style, turning the city into a more symbolic, otherworldly place—would you like me to do that?
