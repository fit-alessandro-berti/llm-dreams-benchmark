you keep catching glimpses of them, but each time you approach, they dissolve into someone else. A woman in a red dress turns around, and for a moment she has your friend's face, but then it's just a stranger asking if you've tried the punch. The punch bowl is impossibly deep; you see your reflection in it, but you're wearing a hat you've never owned.

You move through rooms that shouldn't exist. The hallway leads to a conservatory filled with plants that whisper your name in voices like rustling paper. A group of laughing people block your path, and they all have your mother's eyes. They want to show you a card trick. The cards keep turning into photographs of places you've forgotten you visited.

Your phone buzzes—it's a text from the person you're looking for, but the words keep rearranging themselves. "I'm in the kitchen behind the blue door." There is no blue door. There are seventeen doors, each a slightly different shade, and they multiply whenever you blink. A man with a face like fog tells you, "You're looking for yourself. They've been you all along."

The music from the other room changes tempo with your heartbeat. The floor tilts gently, like a ship. Someone hands you a glass of something that tastes like nostalgia and static. You realize you can't remember who you're looking for anymore, only the feeling of searching. The gathering has become infinite, folding back on itself, and every person you pass might be the one you came with, or the one you are, or the one you're becoming.
