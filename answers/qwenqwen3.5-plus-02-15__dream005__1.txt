...and suddenly, the room begins to shift. The chatter of the crowd doesn't sound like words anymore, but like the rustling of dry leaves in a strong wind. As I push past a group of people wearing masks made of polished mirrors, I realize that when they turn to look at me, their reflections show not my face, but a door.

I try to call out the name of the one person I know, but my voice comes out as a trail of blue bubbles that float upward and pop into tiny stars. The floor beneath my feet softens, turning into warm, deep moss. The groups of people are no longer standing; they are floating gently, tethered to the ceiling by long, glowing ribbons of silk.

I spot a familiar coat near the far wall—a coat I'd recognize anywhere. I reach for it, but as my fingers brush the fabric, the coat unravels into a flock of white moths that scatter into the darkness above. Panic rises, but it feels distant, like watching a storm through thick glass.

Then, a hand grabs my wrist. It's solid and warm. I turn around, and there they are, standing perfectly still in the center of the swirling chaos. They aren't wearing a mask or floating; they are holding an umbrella, despite being indoors.

"You're late," they say, their voice sounding exactly like the rain hitting a windowpane. "The tide is coming in."

I look down and realize the moss is now water, rising quickly around our ankles. Instead of running, we simply open the umbrella together. As the water rises to our chests, then our waists, we don't drown; instead, we begin to float upward, drifting through the ceiling which has dissolved into a night sky filled with constellations shaped like the faces of everyone we just passed. We drift higher, the party fading below us into a silent, glittering city, until the dream gently folds itself away into the soft gray of waking up.
