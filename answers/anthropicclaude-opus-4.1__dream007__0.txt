...pull out a small glass marble from my pocket. As I hold it up between us, it begins to glow softly, and suddenly we're both inside the marble, floating in a swirling galaxy of all our shared memories - that time we got caught in the rain laughing until we couldn't breathe, the night we stayed up talking about our fears, the silly inside jokes only we understand.

The argument seems so small from here, like looking at Earth from space. My friend reaches out and touches one of the floating memories, and it plays like a gentle melody around us. We're both crying now, but also smiling. 

"I forgot," they whisper, "how much bigger we are than this moment."

The marble begins to crack, not in a breaking way, but like an egg hatching. Light spills out and we're back in the room, but everything looks different - the walls are covered in growing vines that bloom with tiny flowers that smell like forgiveness. My friend's shadow and mine are holding hands even though we're still standing apart.

I realize the important thing we were arguing about has transformed into a origami crane in my hand. I unfold it carefully, and inside, written in both our handwriting somehow, are the words: "This too shall pass, but we won't."

The dream shifts, and we're walking together through a door that wasn't there before...
