The dream continues as you follow the strangers into a narrow, lantern-lit alley you’d never noticed before. The city’s chaotic roar softens to a distant hum, replaced by the warm resonance of their voices. They don’t ask where you need to go—instead, they walk beside you, pointing out hidden wonders: a mural glimmering like starlight on brick, a stray cat rubbing against your leg with deliberate affection, and an old bakerywindow where steam fogs the glass in heart shapes.  

One of them, a woman with silver hair threaded with flowers, offers you a small, folded paper. "This isn’t a map," she whispers, "but a key." Inside is a single pressed forget-me-not. The tallest stranger, a man whose eyes crinkle when he smiles, gently guides your hand to touch a weathered doorway carved with constellations. As your fingers trace the wood, you feel a sudden knowing—this building hums with the same rhythm as your own heartbeat.  

The group pauses before it, and you realize they’re waiting for *you* to open the door. When you do, the alley dissolves. Instead of walls, you find yourself in this sky-lit room filled with floating lanterns shaped like birds. Below, the city stretches out like a glittering tapestry, but your fear has vanished. The strangers are still there, but now their faces belong to people you’ve loved and lost—your grandmother’s smile, a childhood friend’s laugh, a mentor’s steady gaze. One by one, they nod and fade into the light, until only a young child remains. They take your hand and point upward.  

Above you, the lanterns burst into swallows, soaring toward the moon. You understand, then, that the city was never lost—only waiting for you to remember how to see it. The child whispers, *"You were always part of the map."* And as you watch the birds disappear into the stars, you wake with the scent of rain and something like cinnamon in the air, no longer dreaming, but found.
