You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people—some laughing in the corner, others huddled around a bar, and a few more forming a tight circle, their whispers laced with secrets. You pause, heart pounding, but the person you seek is nowhere to be found. The air smells of alcohol and tension, and the murmur of the crowd grows louder, wrapping around you like a shroud. You clutch your coat, the fabric rough against your palms, as the realization dawns: this is how it feels to be surrounded by people who don’t know you.  

You glance at the group of strangers, their faces etched with familiarity, and wonder if they’ve already forgotten your name. A sudden rush of anxiety creeps up—what if they’re right? What if the person you’ve only ever known is now… gone? The dreamer’s breath steadies, though their pulse races. In that moment, a flicker of something raw and true flickers in the distance—a shared glance, a single word spoken in a whisper, and the weight of the room dissolves into silence.  

You step forward, the first step in a dance you don’t yet understand, and the dream ends with you standing at the edge of a threshold, the world both familiar and alien, and the only person you know is the one who still waits.
