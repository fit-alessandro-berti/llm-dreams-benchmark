**The Storm’s Heart**

The wind howls like a wounded beast, tearing at the sails as if the very sky seeks to drag your ship into the abyss. The *Iron Mermaid* groans beneath you, her timbers straining, her mast bending like a bowstring pulled too tight. The waves rise like black mountains, their crests frothing with fury, and the lightning splits the heavens in two—each strike illuminating the terror in your crew’s eyes.

You grip the wheel, knuckles white, salt stinging your face. The compass spins wildly, its needle drunk on the storm’s madness. Your first mate, **Elias**, a grizzled man with a scar running from temple to jaw, shouts over the gale: *"Captain! The rudder’s half-gone! We’re being pulled toward the rocks!"*

You glance to starboard. Through the sheets of rain, you see them—the jagged teeth of the **Skeleton Reef**, where a hundred ships have met their end. The sea there churns unnaturally, as if something *beneath* is stirring, waiting.

Then you hear it.

A sound that isn’t the storm.

A deep, resonant *knocking*—like a fist against the hull. Not from the waves. Not from the wind.

*From below.*

Your crew freezes. The cabin boy, **Finn**, clutches his lucky charm—a shark’s tooth on a leather cord—and whispers, *"Captain… what’s down there?"*

You don’t answer. Because you *know*.

The last time you sailed these waters, you lost a man. **Old Tom**, the ship’s carpenter, who swore he’d seen *"them"* in the deeps—pale, long-limbed things with eyes like drowned moons. You called him a drunk. A liar. But now, as the knocking grows louder, as the water *parts* just beyond the bow, revealing a shape too vast to be a whale, too *wrong* to be a rock…

You realize the storm wasn’t the danger.

It was the *invitation*.

A voice, neither human nor beast, slithers into your mind: *"You took something from us, Captain. And now, we take something from you."*

The sea *opens*.

And the *Iron Mermaid* begins to sink.

**How does the dream end?**

1. **You wake up.** The storm fades, but your hands are still clenched, your sheets drenched in sweat. The knocking lingers in your ears. You light a candle, but the shadows in the corner of your room *move* when you aren’t looking.

2. **You fight.** You grab the ship’s bell and ring it in defiance, shouting into the storm: *"I took nothing! And I’ll take nothing from you now!"* The knocking stops. The waves still. The crew gasps as the sea goes unnaturally calm—but the horizon is wrong. The stars are *missing*.

3. **You bargain.** You remember Old Tom’s last words: *"They want a life for a life."* You turn to your crew, your voice steady. *"One of us stays. The rest sail on."* The knocking grows louder. The crew draws lots. Finn’s hand trembles as he pulls the short straw. You watch, numb, as the sea *reaches up* and takes him.

4. **You surrender.** The ship is breaking apart. The water is freezing. You close your eyes and let the current take you. But instead of drowning, you *wake up*… on a shore you don’t recognize. The sand is black. The sky is violet. And something is *singing* your name from the waves.

5. **(Write your own ending.)** The storm parts. The knocking stops. And then—

What do you do, Captain?
