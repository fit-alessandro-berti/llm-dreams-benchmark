…symbols that seem to rearrange themselves when you look away. The lid is warm, like it’s breathing. You press your ear to it and hear a faint ticking that syncs with your heartbeat.

A whisper — maybe the wind, maybe the box — asks you a question you somehow already know the answer to. As you speak it aloud, the patterns glow, then lift off the surface like tiny fireflies. They swirl around your fingers, tracing a key in midair made of light. You turn the key in empty space and feel a click deep in the box.

When you open it, there’s no treasure, only a small mirror. In the mirror you see yourself, but behind you the room is different — endless corridors, a door cracked open, and the sound of your own footsteps walking away. You reach in, and the mirror ripples like water.

Then the ticking stops.
