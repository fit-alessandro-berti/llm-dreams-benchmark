…speak, but the microphone in your hand is warm, breathing a little, like a small bird that flew down to perch there. Your mouth is dry. Your tongue is a page that forgot its words. You say, “Good evening,” and it comes out as a ribbon of blue smoke that curls toward the ceiling, spells nothing, and still makes sense. The crowd leans in, a tide pulled by a moon you can’t see.

You look down and your notes are a map of someone else’s city. Streets cross and uncross. Your name is a cul-de-sac. You can’t remember the route you practiced, so you put the paper back into your pocket and begin to name what is here instead: “Light,” you say, and the spotlight becomes a white coin you could slip under your tongue. “Wood,” you say, and the stage warms under your feet like a dock at noon. “Hands,” you say, and yours become boats, knuckles creaking, ready to ferry you over.

The audience is quiet and not unkind. Their faces are fields wind moves through. You take a breath and your breath is thick with summer—in it are bees, a grill’s first smoke, a bicycle chain. You laugh because it’s absurd to be carrying all that in your chest, and your laugh dislodges something. The first true sentence slides free. It drops to the floor with the sound a marble makes and rolls toward the edge and doesn’t fall. It grows a step. You step onto it. Another sentence. Another step. The stairs build themselves from your voice, a staircase made of held air, and everyone watches as you begin to climb.

Above you the ceiling loosens its buttons. The velvet opens. The night outside peers in, starry as a colander. You tell a small story about the cicadas the summer you were twelve, how they were louder than your thoughts and taught you that noise can be a kind of silence. Someone in the third row nods like you’ve said their name. You mention the vase you broke and hid, the apology that arrived years late and still fit the door. The room exhales like a choir finding a chord. Your throat isn’t a throat anymore; it’s a loom, and you weave a narrow bridge from your ribs to theirs, a span you didn’t know you remembered how to make.

When you falter, the room doesn’t drop you. A cough somewhere becomes a metronome; the exit signs pulse like small suns. The sound system breathes with you. A child sneezes and the sneeze becomes confetti that rains slowly and then is only dust caught in light. Your words change shape. They stop being words. You talk in the color of oranges. You talk in the weight of keys in a pocket. You talk in the feeling of finding a pebble that is exactly the one you needed to worry between your fingers. People catch what you’re saying as if it were soft fruit. They take bites, juice on their chins, smiling.

Halfway through, you realize the speech is no longer coming out of your mouth. It is moving from person to person, an ember passed palm to palm down the rows. Lips move without sound, then with it. In the back, a man you have never met says the line you could not remember, word-perfect, and the applause that follows isn’t clapping but waves collapsing into themselves and remaking the shore. The microphone, that small bird, takes off from your hand and circles the auditorium, leaving a thread of silver you could pull like the string on a light. When you tug, the lights fold like origami cranes and land on shoulders, tame and gentle.

The floor slides a little, the way floors do just before they turn into water. Seatbacks become ripples. The aisle is a current carrying a bright paper boat with your childhood handwriting on it. You step down from the staircase you built and your feet find the surface. It holds. You walk toward the audience and each step leaves a word behind, which grows into a stepping stone for the next person, and the next. Somewhere a fire alarm begins, soft as rain on a tin roof, and the smell of oranges deepens until it is almost a taste, and you remember you are dreaming because in waking life alarms are never kind.

Someone hands you a glass and it is a small lake in your palm. You drink and a silver fish slides into your chest and flicks once and becomes your next calm breath. The theater dims around the edges, becomes your childhood bedroom, the curtain turns into the old bedsheet with planets on it, and the round of applause is the washing machine spinning at midnight. Your cat, gone for years, hops onto the stage/bed and kneads the speech into a soft, forgettable shape. You think, I will remember every word of this. The dream smiles, shakes its head. The audience lifts their hands like a field of grass. You open your mouth to thank them and wake up tasting wood and citrus, your palms stamped with invisible ink that says: it was enough.
