As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns—crisscrossing filigree, shifting under your fingertips, resembling a living puzzle. The box’s surface is etched with symbols that pulse faintly, as though the patterns are part of the mechanism. You trace a fingertip along a spiral, and the symbols coalesce into a sequence: **A, B, C, D, E**—each a geometric shape embedded in the wood.  

Suddenly, the box trembles. A mechanism clicks, and the lid swings open with a whisper. Inside, a single glow emanates, casting elongated shadows on the walls. The room seems to tilt, and the patterns rearrange, forming a spiral that spirals into a spiral of light. You realize the key isn’t material—it’s *the pattern itself*.  

The box’s interior is a labyrinth of mirrors, each reflecting not just the room but fragments of yourself, memories you didn’t know you had. The last mirror shows a figure standing at the threshold of a door, its hand outstretched. The door is not there.  

You step forward, and the patterns dissolve into a melody. The room fills with light, and the box vanishes, leaving only a single note: **"You are the key."**  

The dream ends with you waking, the note etched into your palm, and the door ajar in your mind.
