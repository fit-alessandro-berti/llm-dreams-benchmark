As I stand outside my office building, the blue glow of the light bulb illuminates the room, casting long shadows across the rows of chairs that await me around the corner. My colleagues shout in unison as they see it - their faces beamed with anticipation at the task, a feeling similar to mine. The sense is electric, if not a little overwhelming all at once.

"Sit down, people," my boss tells me kindly. "This is a tricky project. We need to make progress within the given timeline." I take a deep breath, mentally reassessing everything - who's in charge now, what they have on their plate, and where they stand.

As if to reinforce this new reality, a phone ring rings across the room. It's my coworker, Alex, just leaving for work one morning to meet his boss for breakfast. I nod sympathetically as Alex greets me warmly before answering in a low tone. "Hi Alex," I say finally – after hours of waiting.

He glances at someone beside him and smiles, then he calls out again - another colleague, and another - until we all sit down to talk about the project. This is what I imagined when my brain went from being a completely empty field of dreams into real-life nightmares with deadlines looming. As I take mental notes, Alex speaks up in one final burst before returning to his day, and that's after hours.

The rest of the morning unfolds with quiet conversations, but as the clock ticks down on mine, it is suddenly clear something is amiss: perhaps a misunderstanding or an oversight about the deadline has led to this new reality? The task ahead appears less linear, more urgent - my boss must take charge now.
