...already filled in, with elegant blue ink writing out answers already, like a secret code. But the twist? Each question is not just a short answer or a choice—it's a key. Open its corresponding page, and you see the question written in gold letters across the exam sheet. The room is silent except for a soft hum, as if the environment itself is breathing in anticipation.

As you glance at the first marked question, wordlessly whispering, *"Welcome. Your first step begins now,"* you realises you're not alone. Around you, dozens of other students stand frozen, each holding a perfect answer written out like magic.

Suddenly, you’re pulled from your seat by a mysterious voice—not talking, but *reminding* you: this test isn’t about knowledge as you know it. It’s about knowing *who* you are when all the labels are erased.

The room glows with a golden light, and one voice—soft, ancient, yet familiar—echoes in your mind:

> **“You’ve spent years learning how to solve puzzles. But this exam doesn’t ask how you think it. It asks what you *choose* to believe when no one is watching.”**

The seat moves forward on its own, leading you to a blank question. Waiting for you is:

**“What power do you wish to wield, not when the world rewards it, but when you know no one expects a second thought?”**

And below it, hidden from sight, a new page begins to unfurl—a blank slate that changes with your breath. The exam isn’t over. It’s just beginning.

By the end, you’re not grading a test. You’re defining a life.
