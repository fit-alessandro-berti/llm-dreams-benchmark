you realize the wind is holding its breath. The sky doesn't turn gray, but rather a deep, luminous indigo, like ink spreading through water. The birds stop singing, not out of fear, but as if someone pressed pause on the world.

The air grows heavy, smelling not of rain, but of ozone and old paper, like the inside of a forgotten library. You try to run toward shelter, but your feet no longer touch the moss; you are hovering inches above the ground, weightless as a dandelion seed.

The first drop hits your cheek, but it is warm and glows silver. Then another. You look up to see the rain falling upward, pulling loose leaves and dewdrops into the swirling violet clouds above. The trees around you begin to soften, their bark turning into velvet, their branches stretching out like arms wanting to embrace you.

You realize suddenly that you aren't afraid. In fact, the thunder rumbles in time with your own heartbeat. You raise your hand, and the wind obeys, parting the storm to reveal a single wooden door standing freely in the middle of the clearing. There is no wall behind it, only the forest.

You know instinctively that if you open the door, you will wake up. But for a moment, you linger in the silver rain, savoring the magic of the suspension, before reaching for the handle and turning the key to the morning.
