**Completion of the Dream**

...and the sky darkens abruptly, as if night has fallen within minutes. The warm sunlight that was filtering through the leafy canopy above transforms into an eerie, ominous gloom. The first droplets of rain, fat and heavy, start to fall, gently at first, but quickly intensifying into a relentless downpour. The sound of the rain hitting the forest floor and the leaves is deafening, a cacophony that envelops you entirely.

As you quicken your pace, seeking shelter, the wind picks up, whipping your hair into a frenzy and making every step a challenge. Branches sway violently, and the occasional crack of a breaking limb echoes through the forest, making you duck instinctively.

Suddenly, a flash of lightning illuminates the dark sky, casting an otherworldly glow over the forest. In that brief moment, you see a structure in the distance that hadn't been noticeable before - an old, rustic cottage, partially hidden by the dense foliage. Another thunderclap, closer this time, urges you towards the cottage.

You dash through the remaining distance, water soaking through your clothes, and reach the cottage just as a powerful gust of wind tries to push you back. You manage to grab the door handle, twist it, and push your way inside, slamming the door shut behind you to block out the storm's fury.

**Inside the Cottage**

The interior is dimly lit, with only a few rays of the storm's lightning illuminating the space through the small, rounded windows. The air is musty, filled with the scent of old books and woodsmoke. A large, stone fireplace dominates one wall, with a woodpile neatly stacked beside it, inviting a fire.

As your eyes adjust to the dim light, you notice:

1. **A Figure in the Corner**: Seated in a comfortable, oversized armchair, almost hidden in the shadows, is a figure. They seem to be waiting for you, yet haven't acknowledged your entrance. A book lies open on their lap.

2. **A Table with a Lantern and a Note**: In the center of the room, a wooden table has a lantern on it, the wick unlit. Next to the lantern is a note, addressed to "The Unexpected Guest".

3. **Shelves Upon Shelves of Books**: Every available wall space is lined with books, their titles ranging from ancient myths to modern science, and everything in between.

4. **A Staircase Leading Up**: At the back of the cottage, a narrow staircase disappears into the darkness above.
