You stand at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 12th Street, your head spinning. The crowd surges around you, but your mind is a blur. Then, a woman in a bright yellow coat steps beside you, smiling. "Lost?" she asks.  

You nod, unsure of what to answer.  

She pulls out a tiny map from her pocket, already marked with a red X at your current location. "That junction's a tangled mess. I've suggested this to everyone in the deli down the block. Even the pizza guy gets better directions than you, I bet."  

A man with a backpack slivers, "And the Uber drivers justâ€”"  

*Before he can finish, a chime echoes from the streetlights: "Emergency exit detour!" A voice calls from the crowd.*  

The woman turns, teeth flashing. "Oops! Follow me." She darts ahead, the stranger at your side urging you, "Theyâ€™re all here for the same reasonâ€”to keep each other safe. Follow the man with the bag of roasted almonds. Heâ€™s leading a group to the Green Room on 23rd for tonightâ€™s potluck. No hard sells, but... *donâ€™t* ignore the stories they share on the way."  

You follow, your overwhelm fading as their banter fills the air. The stranger at your side gestures to the deliâ€™s window, where a woman hands him a pastry. "Fresh figs from tomorrowâ€™s market. Pick one. They fuel the trail."  

At the Green Roomâ€™s doorstep, the crowd parts like a wave of neighbors. The woman stops you, tossing you a fig. "Join us. Iâ€™ll see you at the bake-off. Keep that... yours."  

You turn, heart lighter, as the man with the bag says, "Dinnerâ€™s at seven. Weâ€™ll figure out your pathâ€”you ready to make a few new friends?"  

You laugh, realizing how much strangers had already shaped your day. The cityâ€™s chaos felt quieter now, a puzzle youâ€™d solve side by side.
