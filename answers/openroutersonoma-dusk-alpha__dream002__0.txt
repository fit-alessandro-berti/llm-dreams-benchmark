You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the sky darkens like spilled ink, thunder rumbling like the growl of some ancient beast awakening beneath the earth. The first fat raindrops splatter on the leaves above, and you quicken your pace, branches whipping at your face as the wind howls through the canopy.

Seeking shelter, you duck under a massive oak tree, its roots twisting like gnarled fingers into the soil. But as the storm unleashes its fury—sheets of rain pounding down, lightning cracking the sky—you notice something impossible: the trees are shifting, their trunks bending unnaturally, forming a path that wasn't there before. A faint glow emanates from deeper in the woods, pulling you forward despite the chaos.

Heart pounding, you follow, the storm's roar fading into a rhythmic chant. Emerging from the deluge, you step into a hidden glade where the rain doesn't fall. In the center stands a shimmering pool, reflecting not the stormy sky, but a starry night filled with unfamiliar constellations. A figure waits there—a luminous deer with antlers like branching rivers—tilting its head as if recognizing you from another life.

You reach out, and the dream ripples, the forest dissolving into whispers. But just as you touch the deer's flank, everything blurs... and you awaken, the echo of rain still pattering on your window, wondering if the storm was ever outside at all.
