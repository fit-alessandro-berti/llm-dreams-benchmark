…speak, but the microphone in your hand is a seashell, humming with the roar of distant tides. The audience leans forward, hands cupped to their ears, as if trying to catch a whisper hidden inside a storm. You glance to the wings for help, and the velvet curtain ripples like a lake, a fish flicking its tail where the tie-back should be.

“Good evening,” you say, but your voice comes out as birds, a small flock of syllables that wheel across the ceiling and settle among the stage lights like warm constellations. The crowd ahhs, and you realize they can read your meaning in the shadows your birds cast, the way the wings of the words turn left for humor, right for sincerity.

You look down at your notes and find they’ve become a map of a town you’ve never lived in, the streets winding around sentences, a cul-de-sac labeled Remember, a bridge called Courage that crosses over a river named Later. You put your finger on a streetlight and it blooms into a point of attention; the audience’s faces glow. You tell them you started this journey in the back row, where doubt tries to sit; you tell them you walked until your feet learned the rhythm of forward, until every corner had a lamp.

Someone coughs, and a handful of moths flutter out, chalky-winged, drawn toward the birds of your voice. You blow gently and they settle on the edge of the stage, turning into pale words: Begin, Continue, Rest. The hush in the room is thick with listening.

You confess you are afraid. The word afraid is a key on your tongue, and it unlocks a drawer in your chest. Out spills a small orchestra: a violin with a cracked chinrest, a drummer with one stick, a trumpeter who inhales like he’s swallowing the moon. They play something shaky but true, and your knees stop knocking, and the stage, feeling the beat, steadies its breathing underfoot.

You tell them—in sentences that unravel like ribbon and mend themselves as they fall—that you thought you needed permission, but all the doors were painted on the scenery, and all the walls were paper. You reach out and press your palm to the air; it gives way like rain. Laughter runs through the audience in a wave, and you can hear your own laugh among theirs, the one that sounds like a screen door on a summer porch.

A child stands up somewhere near the middle, her hair a halo of static. “What if we don’t know how to listen?” she asks, and every head turns, politely, like sunflowers toward her voice.

You answer by tipping the seashell to your ear. The ocean in it is an auditorium of its own, a league of whales trading lullabies. “Then listen to what listens back,” you say, and the word back is a boomerang that arcs over the stage and returns to your hand warm, familiar. You give it to the child without throwing it; she catches it as if she’s been waiting all her life.

You say: This is not a speech, it’s a shared breath. I am not above you; I am among you. My story is a path we lay down as we walk, not a road I traveled alone and fenced off behind me.

In the front row, a man’s tie unravels into a kite string, his stern face softening as the kite lifts into the rafters, tugging his mouth into a smile. In the balcony, a woman braids your sentences into her hair, tight at first, then loosening, and the braid becomes a stream that pours down the aisle, carrying paper boats made of programs and hopes.

You realize there is no podium, never was—only a small garden at your feet. You kneel. The microphone-seashell becomes a trowel. You plant the words you’ve brought, one by one: Thank you, Sorry, Help, Yes. The soil accepts each without complaint. The stagehands—who are also clouds—drift over, and it rains exactly where the seeds lie. Saplings burst up, leaves printed with the fingerprints of everyone in the room. The audience leans forward and their faces are green with light.

You stand and breathe and feel that old fear step sideways, making room. You tell them they are not alone in their trembling. You point to your own hands. They are shaking, and then, as they watch, the tremble becomes a hum, and the hum becomes a note that matches the orchestra in your chest, and someone in the back begins to sing, and someone else joins, and the song is a bridge you all walk onto without looking down.

Then the fire alarm starts flashing, except it’s not an alarm, it’s applause, except it’s not hands, it’s rain on a tin roof that you all recognize from somewhere inside. You bow and the stage bows with you and the curtain bows and even your shoes bow, and when you straighten, the auditorium is a forest.

They stand to go, except there are no doors anymore. There are only paths, diverging like a choice you don’t have to dread. People take them, carrying their leaves, their small orchestras, their paper boats. The child with the boomerang turns and throws it to you one last time; it returns heavy with a promise: Keep going.

You nod, and you do. The microphone is a seashell again. You lift it, and you begin to speak, and the birds of your voice rise one more time, circling once, twice, and then flying out through the open ceiling, where the sky has been listening all along.
