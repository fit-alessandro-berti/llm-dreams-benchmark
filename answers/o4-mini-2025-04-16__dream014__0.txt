…accept their outstretched hands, and the noise of the city softens around you. Together you step off the crowded sidewalk and onto a narrow lane you’d never noticed before. The strangers’ faces glow in the dusk light—each one different, yet all sharing the same warm, gentle expression.

They guide you past shuttered shops and under strings of lanterns that hum with color. Every footstep feels lighter, as if the pavement itself is lifting you. One of them presses a small, copper-tinted map into your hand. Its lines shift under your fingers, rearranging to spell out your own name. You sense that this map leads not to a street address but to somewhere deeper: the place inside you where clarity and courage live.

As you follow the map, the strangers fall into a loose procession behind you, whispering directions that sound like half-remembered lullabies. The buildings around you elongate, their windows reflecting stars you don’t recognize. At the end of the alley, you find a weathered door set into a mossy wall. Heart pounding, you turn the map toward it—and the lines glow, revealing the single word “Home.”

With their encouragement ringing in your ears, you push the door open. Inside is a bright courtyard, flourishing with impossible flowers that bloom in patterns you’ve only dreamed of. The strangers step back into shadow, nodding, as if to say, “Now you know the way.” You take a deep breath, feeling the loneliness lift. For the first time all night, you smile—and step forward into a place that, in your dream, you already know belongs to you.
