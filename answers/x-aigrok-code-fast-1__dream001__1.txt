### The Dream Continues...

You start to panic, your heart racing like a runaway subway car, but then you spot a flickering neon sign overhead: "Dreamer's Directory – All Knowledge Within Reach!" Drawn by an inexplicable urge, you push through a crowd of smiling strangers who seem to know who you are, their faces blurring like watercolor under rain.

Inside, the directory is a labyrinth of glowing files and whispering holograms. You flash your memory like a keycard, and out pops a crisp digital map with a glowing route marked in electric blue. "Meeting at the Mirage Tower, level 47, suite with the view of eternity," it whispers. But as you step out, reality bends—streets twist into Escher staircases, taxis turn into flying carpets, and the hourglass on your wrist counts down in reverse.

Hustling down avenues that shift colors with your mood, you dodge acrobatic vendors juggling anxieties and desires. Suddenly, a friendly pigeon lands on your shoulder, twittering directions in your ear: "Right at the statue of Forgotten Promises, up the escalator to Nowheresville." You trust the bird—after all, this is your dream—and burst into the lobby just as the clock chimes eight bells. The elevator waits, doors open to infinity. Do you step in, or fly? The choice is yours... but in dreams, choosing is just another way to wake up.
