...The din of conversation swells and crashes around me like waves, each group a tide pool teeming with life I don't understand. I clutch my flimsy paper cup, the punch inside sloshing precariously close to the rim, a microcosm of my own internal instability. Where is Sarah? She said she'd be by the food table.

I navigate past a circle of people laughing uproariously at something I missed. Their faces blur together, becoming a kaleidoscope of amusement. I try to catch someone's eye, offer a tentative smile, but they seem oblivious, caught in their own orbit. I feel like a ghost, drifting through their laughter.

The food table is a cornucopia of miniature quiches, glistening fruit skewers, and artfully arranged crudités. But no Sarah. Instead, a woman with hair the color of sunset catches my eye. She's explaining something with elaborate hand gestures to a man who nods solemnly, his brow furrowed in concentration. I think they're talking about… bees?  No, maybe bicycles. Their words dissolve into a nonsensical hum before I can decipher them.

I move on, my feet sinking into plush carpet that feels like quicksand. A knot of people dressed entirely in black are huddled together, their voices hushed and conspiratorial. They glance at me, their eyes like obsidian stones, and I quickly avert my gaze, a chill crawling down my spine. What are they whispering about?

Then, I see a face I recognize, or think I do. A man with kind eyes and a gentle smile. He raises a hand in greeting. "You must be..." he starts, but his voice fades into static, like a radio station losing its signal. His face flickers, then morphs into someone else, someone I've never seen before.

The room seems to expand and contract, the walls breathing. The faces around me become distorted, like reflections in a funhouse mirror. I feel dizzy, unmoored. Where is Sarah?  Did she ever really say she'd be here?  Was there ever even a Sarah?

Desperation claws at me. I push through the crowd, my paper cup crumpling in my hand. The punch spills, staining my clothes a sickly sweet pink. I don't care. I need to find someone, anyone I know. 

And then, through the swirling chaos, I see them. Standing alone in the center of the room. But it's not Sarah. It's... me. Another me, staring back with wide, frightened eyes. They open their mouth to speak, and as their voice begins to form a word, the dream shatters, leaving me blinking in the darkness of my room, the lingering taste of punch on my tongue and a nameless dread clinging to my heart.
