...written in a language you’ve never seen before—swirling glyphs that shift like ink on water, rearranging themselves every time you blink. Panic claws at your throat. You glance around: the other students are scribbling furiously, their pens moving as if guided by invisible hands. The air smells of ozone and old parchment.

Then you notice something stranger. The exam booklet isn’t paper—it’s alive. The pages breathe faintly, rising and falling like a sleeping chest. One corner curls toward you, almost beckoning.

You reach out, hesitant, and trace a finger along a particularly intricate symbol. Instantly, the room dissolves.

You’re no longer in a classroom but standing on the edge of a vast obsidian plain beneath twin moons. The questions hover before you now, not as text, but as riddles whispered by the wind:

*“What is the weight of a promise?”*  
*“If a memory has no witness, does it exist?”*  
*“Draw the shape of your fear—but leave space for hope in the margins.”*

A figure approaches—your future self, cloaked in starlight, holding out not a pen, but a compass made of bone and quartz. “The exam isn’t to test what you know,” they say, voice echoing like distant thunder. “It’s to see if you’re ready to become the question.”

You wake with a gasp, heart pounding. On your desk lies a single sheet of paper, blank except for one line in your own handwriting:

**“Begin.”**
