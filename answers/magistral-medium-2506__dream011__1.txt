unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. Instead of standard multiple-choice or essay questions, the exam consists of a series of riddles, abstract puzzles, and surreal scenarios. The first question reads:

**"If a shadow whispers to the moon, what color does the wind cry?"**

You glance around the room, but all the other test-takers seem unfazed, scribbling furiously. A sense of panic creeps in—how can you answer something so vague? Suddenly, the proctor’s voice echoes:

*"Remember, the answers are not in the questions. They are in the spaces between."*

As you stare at the page, the ink begins to shimmer, and the words rearrange themselves into a playground from your childhood. The test dissolves into a memory of you building sandcastles, each grain of sand a fragment of knowledge you didn’t know you had. You hear laughter—it’s your own, younger self, whispering:

*"You already know. Just listen."*

Then, the exam hall vanishes, and you’re standing on a bridge between two cliffs. On one side is a door labeled "CERTAINTY," and on the other, a swirling vortex of colors. A figure in a hooded robe appears and hands you a blank sheet of paper. They say:

*"The exam was never about answers. It was about the question you carry inside."*

You wake up—or do you?

Would you like to explore what happens next? Or perhaps interpret the dream’s meaning?
