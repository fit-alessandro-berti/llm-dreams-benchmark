...not written in words, but are a series of small, intricate dioramas embedded in the polished surface of your desk.

The first one is a perfect, miniature replica of your childhood bedroom. A tiny version of you is hiding something under a loose floorboard. The unwritten question hangs in the air, heavy and silent: *What did you hide, and why are you still afraid for anyone to find it?*

You glance to your left. A classmate isn't writing; she is frantically trying to weave a tiny blanket from a single strand of sunlight slanting through the high window. To your right, a boy is humming a melody, trying to coax a single, wilting flower on his desk back to life. No one has a pen.

Your gaze snaps back to your own desk. The second question-diorama shows a dinner table with your family. Everyone is laughing, but their mouths are sealed shut with wax. The implied question: *What is the one truth that would break the silence?*

The proctor, a tall figure made of polished mahogany and brass gears, clicks and whirs at the front of the room. It has no face, only the slow, sweeping hand of a grandfather clock. The ticking is the only sound, each tick a second falling away from your future.

Panic begins to set in. How do you answer these? You have no tools, no words. You are supposed to build a career on this, a life, and you can't even begin. You look at the final diorama. It is the simplest and most terrifying. It’s just a small, flawless mirror, showing your own wide, frightened eyes. The question is a feeling, a cold dread that seeps into your bones: *Who are you, really, when no one is looking?*

The ticking of the clock-proctor grows louder, faster. The student weaving with sunlight begins to weep as the sunbeam fades. The humming boy's flower crumbles to dust.

You look at your reflection in the tiny mirror. You have no answer. The career, the future, it's all slipping away. But then, a strange calm settles over you. This is a dream. And in a dream, the rules are different.

You don’t need a pen.

Slowly, you reach out. You don't try to answer the questions. You change them.

You gently place a finger on the tiny figure in your childhood room, not to expose its secret, but to pat its back in reassurance. The diorama clouds over, like frosted glass.

You lean close to the silent family dinner and whisper, "It's okay. You can talk now." A tiny, warm light begins to glow from the center of the table.

Finally, you look into the mirror. You don't try to define the reflection. You just wink at it.

The reflection winks back.

The loud ticking stops. The clockwork proctor turns its smooth, faceless head toward you. It extends a brass hand, and instead of a grade, it places a single, smooth, grey stone in your palm. It's warm.

You look down at the stone, and as you do, the examination hall, the desks, and the other students dissolve into mist. You are left floating in a quiet, dark space, clutching the stone. You don't know what career it has earned you, but you feel a profound sense of peace. You passed.

And as you begin to wake, the warmth of the stone seems to remain in the palm of your real hand.
