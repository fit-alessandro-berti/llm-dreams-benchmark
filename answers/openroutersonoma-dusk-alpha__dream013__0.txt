You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, you begin to notice the walls shifting subtly, whispering hints in a language that feels both ancient and eerily familiar—like echoes of your own thoughts. The air grows thicker with a shimmering mist that clouds your vision but sharpens your mind, forcing you to rely on intuition as much as logic.

At the next turn, a grand riddle blocks your path: a pedestal with three glowing orbs, each pulsing with colors that represent past regrets, present desires, and future uncertainties. To proceed, you must align them in a sequence that balances your life's narrative—twist the regret orb counterclockwise to release its weight, pulse the desire orb in rhythm with your heartbeat to harness its fire, and let the uncertainty orb spin freely until it settles into harmony. As you solve it, the pedestal hums approvingly, and a door creaks open, revealing a chamber where the maze's architect awaits: a shadowy figure that mirrors your own reflection, challenging you with the ultimate puzzle—confronting the dream itself to wake or wander forever. Do you accept the challenge, or does the dream dissolve into waking light?
