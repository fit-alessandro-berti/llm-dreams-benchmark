As I sit down to start the exam, I notice the questions are not written in ink, but in shimmering, shifting threads of silver light that seem to hover just millimeters above the paper. 

They aren't about mathematics, or law, or history. 

**Question 1** reads: *“Recall the exact smell of the air five minutes before the first time you felt true heartbreak. Describe the color of the silence that followed.”*

I look around the room. The other students are scribbling furiously, their pens making no sound. The clock on the wall has no numbers, only a single hand that moves backward, sweeping away the seconds I thought I had left.

**Question 2** says: *“List the names of the versions of yourself that you abandoned to get to this chair. Which one is currently standing behind you?”*

I feel a cold draft on my neck. I want to turn around, but my limbs feel heavy, like I’m moving through deep water. I look back at the paper, and the silver threads begin to unspool, drifting off the page and tangling around my fingers.

**Question 3** is the most important. It’s the one that determines my future. It says: *“The door to your future has no handle and no key. To open it, you must provide the one word you’ve been afraid to say out loud since you were seven years old.”*

The proctor—a figure whose face is a blurred smudge of watercolor—walks toward me. They lean down, their breath smelling like rain on hot asphalt, and whisper, *"You have one minute left. The ink is drying, and the sun is rising."*

I realize then that the "career" I’m testing for isn't a job at all. It’s the role of the person who decides whether the sun actually comes up tomorrow. My heart hammers against my ribs. I press my pen to the paper, but instead of ink, a vivid memory of a yellow kite flying into a storm pours out of the nib. 

I start to write the word, the one I’ve hidden for years, but as the first letter touches the page, the classroom floor begins to turn into a vast, dark lake. The desks are floating away. My chair is sinking. 

I look at the paper one last time as it dissolves into bubbles. The last question has changed. It now simply says:

*“Wake up. You’ve already passed.”*
