...hurdles that defy the logic of the waking world.

The waiting room, once a sterile gray office, suddenly floods with knee-deep water that smells like old books and coffee. To get to the interview room, I have to swim, but my suit remains perfectly dry. The other candidates aren't swimming; they are walking on the surface of the water, looking down at their phones, which are actually blocks of melting ice.

I reach the heavy oak door at the end of the hall. It opens not into an office, but onto a narrow tightrope stretched between two skyscrapers made entirely of glass filing cabinets. The wind up here whispers the doubts I’ve had since I was twelve.

"Show us your resume," a voice booms from the clouds.

I reach into my pocket, but instead of paper, I pull out a handful of glowing fireflies. I have to release them in a specific pattern to prove my worth. As they scatter, they form constellations of my past achievements—my first project, the time I helped a stranger, a painting I made in kindergarten.

The final challenge stands before me: a version of myself, but dressed in the clothes of the person I wish I was. We have to play a game of chess, but the pieces are alive and moving on their own accord. I realize the goal isn't to win, but to convince the King to lay down his sword peacefully.

When I do, the board dissolves into light. The "Dream Job" isn't a title or a paycheck. The Grand Prize is a key made of starlight. I place it into the air, turn it, and a door opens in the fabric of the sky.

I step through, and I am sitting in a chair made of clouds, in control of the sunrise. My job is to paint the morning colors for the world below. I pick up a brush, dip it in gold, and begin to work.

Then, the alarm rings.
