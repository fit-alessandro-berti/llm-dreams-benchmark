speak, but no sound comes out. Your voice is missing. The audience watches in silence, their faces unreadable. You clear your throat and try again, but still, nothing. Panic begins to rise in your chest.

Then, out of nowhere, a single person in the front row stands up and begins to applaud. Slowly, others join in, clapping rhythmically. The sound grows louder, filling the space. You don’t understand—why are they applauding when you haven’t said a word?

Suddenly, you feel something shift within you. The stage beneath you begins to ripple like water, and you realize you are no longer standing, but floating. The audience fades into darkness, replaced by a vast starry sky. You reach out, and the stars seem to pulse in response.

A voice—not your own, but familiar—whispers in your ear: *“You don’t need words here. Just listen.”*

And so you do.
