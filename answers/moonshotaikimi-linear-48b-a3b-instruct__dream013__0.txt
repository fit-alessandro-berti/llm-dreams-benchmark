…the air grows colder, the walls closer, and the light dimmer.  
But the puzzles don’t get harder—they get stranger.

### Step 6: The Echo Chamber  
A spiral staircase descends into a circular room lined with mirrors.  
On the floor is a keypad labeled with symbols instead of numbers.  
You must dial a code that matches the sequence of echoes heard when you clap once.  
The first echo repeats your clap, the second inverts it, the third adds a warble…  
You realize the final echo is the exact moment your childhood self stopped believing in magic.  
The keypad rearranges itself into the age you were then.  
You press 7.  
A hidden door opens.

### Step 7: The Library of Unfinished Thoughts  
Shelves stretch to a ceiling lost in shadow.  
Books hum with half-formed ideas you’ve never finished.  
You instinctively reach for one titled *“How to Leave a Place You’ve Never Arrived At”*.  
The moment your fingers touch it, the book vanishes, and a new corridor appears, lit by the faint glow of footnotes that haven’t been written yet.  
Footprints in the dust are yours—but barefoot, as if time had folded.

### Step 8: The Mirror Maze Reversed  
You backtrack—except now the mirrors show futures instead of reflections.  
In one, you’re old, holding a key you’ve never seen, standing where you are now.  
In another, you’re young, tearing up a map of this maze and burying it beneath a sapling.  
You choose the third mirror: you’re walking *away* from the maze, hand in hand with someone whose face you can’t quite focus on.  
The mirror cracks.  
The maze exhales, and the walls shift, revealing a single room with no puzzles, no doors—only a table set for two.

On the table waits a note written in your own handwriting:  
*“You solved the last puzzle when you stopped trying to escape.”*  
The chairs creak as they slide out.  
You sit.  
The someone from the mirror enters, holding a teacup with no tea.  
They say nothing.  
But the cup warms in your hands.
