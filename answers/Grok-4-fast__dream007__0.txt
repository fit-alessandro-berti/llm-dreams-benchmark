You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to settle it the only way that makes sense in dreams: by challenging them to a duel of interpretive dance on the edge of a volcano.

The lava bubbles below like a pot of forgotten soup, casting an orange glow on your friend's face—twisted in fury one moment, then cracking into reluctant amusement the next. "Fine," they huff, kicking off their shoes, which promptly melt into the rock like wax. You both start moving, awkward at first—your arms flailing like startled chickens, their spins more like a tipsy tornado. But as the rhythm of the earth's rumble takes hold, the dance evolves. You weave betrayal into a pirouette, they counter with forgiveness in a dramatic dip, and suddenly the argument dissolves like mist.

The volcano doesn't erupt; instead, it sighs, spewing forth a cascade of fireflies that light up the sky in Morse code apologies. You collapse in laughter on the cooled ledge, sharing a thermos of chamomile tea that tastes suspiciously like reconciliation. Your friend nudges you: "Next time, let's just argue over pizza toppings." And as the dream fades, you wake with the echo of that laughter, wondering if volcanoes ever dream back.
