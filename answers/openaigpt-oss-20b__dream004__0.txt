The world keeps shifting, as if the atmosphere itself were an ever‑repeating kaleidoscope. Swirls of violet try on the lightness of blue, then melt into a buttery amber that rolls like a tide, and in a peculiar instant the shape of the horizon morphs into towering, jagged prisms that pulse with an inner disco of fireflies.

You close your eyes for just one breath, letting the rhythm of your heart sync with the undulating sky, and when you open them again the blanks are already humming. An empty canvas, white as a newborn’s smile, sits alone on a pedestal made of clear glass that reflects you back whose features are both familiar and incomplete, as if your own outline were rendered in crayon.

Approach it. The canvas vibrates, like the low buzz of a cello string. You feel a soft warmth spreading across your fingertips as though the surface itself was eager.

You reach out and hover—no immediate pressure, just the suggestion that the moment is yours to shape. Instinctively you close your eyes and let the music of the sky fill your mind.

For a time there is just silence. Then the blank swells, its edges rippling like liquid silver. Colors rise out of the darkness like tired dreams spilling out of a thousand sleeping heads. A streak of emerald suddenly splits into thousands of tiny shards that swirl and clatter like silver bells. A splash of star‑gold arcs across the canvas, tracing a spiral that seems to turn toward the earth and back again, leaving a faint smell of jasmine in its wake.

The shapes that appear are not static—they morph. A flower curls into a spindle, then unspools into a fragile line that rises and dips. A jagged star melts into a waver, and from that waver, a voice—soft as wind through glass—whispers. “Paint us,” it says, “the things that move, the songs that pause, the silence that.”

“So? What do I do?”

“To let yourself be the brush, too.”

You lift a hand, and instead of a paintbrush, your own skin turns into a blanket of feathers, each feather trembling with a color about to be born. The canvas’s surface ripples in applause. You dip your feathered hand into the silica cloud of pigments emerging from the void—these are not mere substances but stories. A crimson that remembers agony in a different language, teal that remembers laughter in a forgotten tongue, amber that never quite knows which way it shines.

As you paint, you realize that the paint is creating the world around you in real time. Every line and shade curls into tiny civilizations; the will-o-wisps you see before you begin echo the patterns you just conjured. The shapes that once seemed ordinary now sway to the rhythm of your breath, each a living meta‑particle dancing on the margins of the surreal.

The canvas no longer occupies a place between the elements; it recedes and expands. You fall through its surface, down a corridor of color, and find yourself standing again in that unmistakable, vibrant world where shapes shift like thought and light plays like the wind.

The moment the canvas comes back to its form, the idea of it as an object dissolves. It sits on a foundation crafted of possibility—stars, tears, the hush of a newborn secret. It’s open, it gages awareness, it beckons. And you, the dreamer—no longer separate from the world around you—know that what you have drawn is now living.

you realize: the blank canvas was not empty at all. It was waiting—for the boldness to touch, to let the colors and shapes that you had been chasing all along into that unfinished space, to finally make the dream a little less dreamlike.
