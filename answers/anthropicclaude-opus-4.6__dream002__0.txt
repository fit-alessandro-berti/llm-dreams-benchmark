# The Dream

You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and—

—the air goes *wrong*.

Not just heavy. Not just electric. The pressure drops so fast your ears pop, and the birdsong doesn't fade—it **stops**, mid-note, as if someone lifted a needle from a record. The trees, which moments ago swayed gently, now stand perfectly, unnaturally still. Even the leaves freeze in place.

Then the wind arrives—not from one direction, but from *below*. It rises through the soil, carrying the scent of wet stone and something older, something that smells like the word **forgotten**.

I look down and notice my shadow is moving independently, stretching toward a clearing I don't remember being there. It pulls at my feet like a gentle tide. I follow it—not because I choose to, but because in this place, refusing doesn't occur to me.

The clearing opens into an impossible geometry. Rain begins to fall *upward* from the grass, silver droplets rising into a sky that has turned the color of bruised plums. Lightning flashes, but instead of illuminating, each bolt briefly turns everything to **darkness**—negative lightning, stealing light instead of giving it.

In the center of the clearing stands a door. Just a door. No walls, no frame anchored to anything. It's old wood, painted red, with a brass handle gone green with patina. Rain rises around it like a cathedral of water.

I know—the way you *know* things in dreams, without evidence—that the storm isn't weather at all. It's the door **breathing**. Each thunderclap is a heartbeat. The storm will end only when I choose: open it, or walk away.

My hand reaches for the handle. The brass is warm.

I turn it.

And on the other side is... another forest. Quieter. Peaceful. Sunlit. Almost identical to where I started. But the trees are growing upside down, roots reaching into a sky of rich earth, branches buried in clouds beneath my feet. I'm walking on the sky, and it holds me.

Somewhere behind me, the door clicks shut and becomes a tree.

The birdsong resumes—but it's a melody I've never heard before, and yet I'm certain I've been humming it my entire life.

I keep walking.

*The dream doesn't end. It just becomes the next dream.*
