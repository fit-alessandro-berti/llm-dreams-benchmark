...a single, glowing brush poised in mid-air, suspended above it as if waiting for a hand that isn't there. The air hums with latent potential, like the moment before a symphony begins. You reach out, fingers tingling as they near the brush—then stop.  

Something inside you *knows*: this canvas isn’t blank. It’s listening.  

You close your eyes. And instead of painting, you *remember*—a childhood memory of rain on a windowpane, the ache of a first goodbye, the taste of summer berries under the tongue. The colors in the world warp instantly: blues swirl into amber sunsets, shapes fold into crumpled paper boats, and the air tastes suddenly of salt and sunlight.  

The brush vibrates. Not in your hand—but *through* your skin. It begins to draw *you*: your silhouette etched in shimmering silver, your shadow becoming a constellation of forgotten lullabies. The canvas breathes.  

Then, with a soft sigh, the painting *folds itself* into a tiny origami bird, wings trembling. It hovers just above your palm.  

A whisper, not in your ears, but in your bones:  
*"You didn’t create it. You remembered it. Now—where will you send it?"*  

The world flickers. The bird opens its beak. And in its throat, you see the face of someone you lost.  

You don’t know if it’s time to wake.  
But you *do* know: the dream has just begun.
