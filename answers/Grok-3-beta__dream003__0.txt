symbols etched into its surface—swirls and geometric shapes that seem to shift slightly when you’re not looking directly at them. The box is cool to the touch, almost humming with a faint energy that makes the hairs on your arms stand up. You turn it over in your hands, searching for a clue, when suddenly a voice whispers from nowhere, "The answer lies within you." 
Startled, you look around, but there’s no one there—just the box and the stillness of the dream. You press your fingers against the lid, and it clicks softly, as if responding to your touch. The patterns glow faintly, rearranging themselves into a riddle: "I am weightless but you can see me. Put me in a bucket and I’ll make it lighter. What am I?" 
You pause, pondering the words. The answer feels close, like a memory you can’t quite grasp. Then it hits you—a hole. You whisper the word aloud, and the box trembles. The lid springs open, revealing a swirling void inside, a miniature galaxy of stars and colors spinning endlessly. You reach in, and instead of feeling nothing, your hand brushes against something solid—a small, smooth key, warm against your skin. 
As you pull it out, the box dissolves into mist, and the dream shifts. You’re standing in a vast, misty field, the key glowing faintly in your hand. Ahead, a door materializes—tall, wooden, and ancient, with no walls around it, just floating in the air. The key fits perfectly into its lock, and as you turn it, the door creaks open, flooding your vision with blinding light. You step through, and— 
The dream ends there, leaving you with the sensation of falling, and a lingering question: what lies on the other side?
