The hallway stretches longer than it should, lit by an amber glow, and when you turn back, your friend is suddenly across a wide lake, their words traveling as ripples instead of sound. You wade in, the water warm and humming, and with each step the anger softens into a heavy, honest sorrow. In the center, the two of you meet on a small wooden dock that wasn’t there a moment ago. 

You both fall silent. The important thing you were fighting about turns into a handful of colored paper boats, and you set them on the water together, watching them drift away. As the last one disappears into a curtain of fog, your friend smiles, the tension dissolving like mist, and you wake up with the feeling that the argument was never really about winning—just about being heard.
