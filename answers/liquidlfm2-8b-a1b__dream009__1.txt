find shelter—quickly. The golden light of early morning spills over rough-hewn wooden beams in a bustling medieval marketplace. Cobbled streets dry beneath the sun, uneven with shoe prints and worn bricks. Strangers call out in archaic tongues, merchants hawk brightly colored goods from wooden stalls, and the mingling scents of fresh bread, spiced meats, and damp stone fill the air.

You notice your clothes—strange, synthetic fibers—stand out like a wound. No smartwatch, no earbuds, no glowing screen. Your mind slowly adjusts to the clatter of hooves on stone, the ring of a blacksmith’s hammer, the low hum of conversation in dialects long forgotten.

You realize you need to **blend in—learn the unspoken rules of this world**, to survive and perhaps find a way back to your time.  

You approach a group of apprentices with curious eyes, trying to mimic their posture and speech. A kindly elder notices your confusion and offers a warm smile, pointing you toward a nearby inn and teaching you a greeting in old words. Slowly, you begin to feel the rhythm of this age—its cadence, its warmth, its rules.  

In this dream, you awaken not just to a different time, but to a new way of being: humble, observant, and deeply connected to the human story unfolding around you. And though you long for the familiar, you carry something new—a quiet belonging to this world, born not of memory, but of presence.
