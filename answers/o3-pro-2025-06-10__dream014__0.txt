…decide to follow them.

They lead you off the main avenue, slipping between neon-lit noodle shops and vendors whose carts smell of cinnamon and rain. A narrow alley appears where you’re sure no alley existed a moment ago. It bends like a question mark, and the strangers—six of them—form a gentle circle around you as you walk.

None of them give their names, yet each seems uncannily familiar. One hums a lullaby your grandmother once sang. Another carries a battered guidebook with your own handwriting in the margins. The youngest, a freckled girl, keeps tugging at your sleeve, eager for you to see what’s ahead.

The alley opens onto a rooftop that hangs impossibly above the city—half garden, half train station. Vines twine around iron rails, and tiny paper lanterns float upward like reversed snowflakes. A silver locomotive idles there, its engine breathing slow clouds that smell of peppermint and thunder.

“The way home,” says the oldest stranger, a tall woman whose coat is stitched with constellations, “isn’t a street on any map. It’s a direction inside you.” She places a small compass in your palm. It has no needle—just a circle of liquid light that pulses in rhythm with your heartbeat.

You board the train. The city drops away, replaced by corridors of memory:

• In one car, you see your childhood bedroom, moonlight flooding the walls.
• In the next, the café where you once laughed so hard you cried, chairs floating like balloons.
• In another, an unfinished dream you abandoned years ago waits patiently at a table set for two.

Your companions sit with you, each revealing they’re versions of yourself—fragments you forgot while hurrying through life. The freckled girl? Your curiosity. The humming man? Your nostalgia. The tall woman? Your future self who never stopped believing you’d find your path.

At the final stop the doors slide open to a quiet square bathed in dawn. No crowds, no noise—just a single street that stretches straight toward a horizon the color of possibility. The strangers fade into the soft light, leaving only the compass, now glowing steadily.

You take a breath, step forward, and feel the city rearrange itself behind you, streets clicking into place like a solved puzzle. For the first time you know exactly where you’re going.

A distant bell rings. You wake, the echo of lanterns still drifting behind your eyes—and on your nightstand, where nothing but clutter should be, lies a small circle of light, slowly pulsing, pointing inward, pointing home.
