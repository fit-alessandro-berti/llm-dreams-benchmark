**Dream Completion:**

You wake in a sun-dappled meadow, the air thick with the scent of wild herbs and woodsmoke. Around you, thatched cottages cluster like mushrooms, their timber frames bowed with age. A dirt path winds toward a bustling market square, where villagers barter wool sacks and clay pots. Their linen tunics and leather aprons mark this as the Middle Ages—**12th century**, perhaps. Panic flutters in your chest: *No phones, no electricity, no way back*.  

As you wander, a hand clamps your shoulder. A burly man with a rust-streaked apron—the blacksmith—glares. “Strangers bring trouble,” he growls, while others mutter about failed crops and a looming tax collector. You’re an outsider here, a threat unless you prove useful.  

Then you spot the miller’s son, feverish and shaking in the hay. “The sweating sickness,” whispers an old woman, clutching an amulet. Your modern memory flashes: *Hygiene. Clean water. Herbs.* You blurt, “I can help!” Skepticism hangs heavy, but desperation wins.  

Guided by half-remembered biology, you demand boiled cloth, willow bark, and mint. The villagers comply, eyes wide as you steep a bitter tea and cool the boy’s brow. Days pass; his fever breaks. Relief ripples through the crowd. The blacksmith nods, grudging respect in his gaze.  

That night, the elder offers you a straw pallet by the hearth. “Stay,” she says, “teach us your ways.” You hesitate, torn between worlds—until dawn light spills through the shutters, and the dream dissolves…  

**You awake**, the taste of herbs lingering, your heart pounding with the echo of a life that never was—or was it?
