symbols etched into its surface, glowing faintly with a soft blue light. The patterns seem to shift and swirl when you're not looking directly at them, forming shapes that feel almost familiar—like half-remembered words from a language you once knew.

Running your fingers along the edges, you feel the box vibrating gently, humming with a frequency that resonates in your chest. The intricate etchings begin to form recognizable images: a crescent moon, a spiral shell, an open eye, and what looks like your own hand reaching toward something just beyond the frame.

As you touch the symbol of the hand, the box grows warm. The lid doesn't open, but somehow you know—you've always known—that the key isn't separate from the box at all. It's in the pattern itself. You trace the spiral with one finger, then the moon, then the eye, following an intuition that feels like memory.

The symbols light up in sequence beneath your touch, brightening until they're almost too brilliant to look at. There's a soft click, and the box begins to open on its own, revealing inside...

A mirror. But the reflection looking back at you isn't quite you—or perhaps it's more you than you've ever been. It smiles, and suddenly you understand that the box wasn't locked to keep something in.

It was locked to keep something out, until you were ready to let it in.
