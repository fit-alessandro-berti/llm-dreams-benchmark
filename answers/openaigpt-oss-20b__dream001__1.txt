You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to feel the tongue of a waking thought lurch over the edge of your mind, and before you can think, the city around you begins to rearrange itself.

The streets are not straight but swell like waves, and the buildings rise in fractal spirals that echo with a low, humming frequency that you instinctively sense is a greeting. A street sign, written in a script you cannot read, flickers to life and then dissolves into a spray of golden dust. The dust settles on your shoulder, and instead of your fingertips there is an accordion of cool, electric-blue light crackling with the same frequency, as if the city is conducting a symphony inside your skin.

You begin to walk, and as soon as a foot touches the pavement, the city shifts: every car that's a car becomes a translucent corridor, and a road that seemed to lead in one direction subtly bends and curves on its own, suggesting that the city cares less about directions than about destinations.

You realize you are no longer alone. A figure appears out of a cloud of glass in the corner, its face a shroud of shifting colors. It speaks in a voice that sounds more like the wind than a person. “You’re delayed.” It says, gently. “Go the other way.” The city begins to tilt — the air itself brightens, robots float airily past, and the pavements ripple like a cauldron of liquid gold. Your vision narrows as if you are looking through a magnifying glass, focusing on whatever is the company; but whatever you see is out of focus: sections of old neighborhoods meld into modern malls, alleys appear that end in fruit trees bearing glass fruit that think of you like fluffy shadows.

At the edge of this floating mood station, a fleeting message appears — in an alphabet that mimics your own heartbeats — that reads: “Meeting at the Mouth of the River of Forgotten Voices.” It sounds like a whisper that does not come from any speaker, just the city itself. You remember the last working day you had an important meeting and feel a chill at the realization that the whole city is buzzing with voices of those who never had a chance to speak.

Adopting the posture of curiosity, you follow the sound. The city now looks to be walking on a grid that extends as far as your mind can see, tripling in density with each step. Things akin to streets appear like veins in a leaf, but reach out and fold back on themselves so they are both where you were and that you have never been in the city. Buildings unfold and extend until they are long as the horizon. And at the exact center of the city — at the latitudinal crossroad where the world meets the memory — a huge, arching door made of rusted glass swallows up surrounding heat, inviting and noxious. Its presence blurs between an actual door and a written line in an ancient language.

You walk forward, noting that the city seems to respond to each of your steps. The ground beneath you vibrates to match the rhythm of your heartbeat. Cold and warm sensations mingle, heat rising in the skin of your toes accompanied by a trickle of cold at your arms, like every nerve watching, listening and waiting. The city invites a sense of sincere time that doesn’t have a tick, but that is marking the moment you realize you are very close to your meeting room.

The arch glows in your presence, and the fashioned realises that somehow you need to learn how to speak with the city, not just keep walking. You take your hands to the arch and press them into it, as if your fingertips would touch water. To your astonishment a passage appears from one side of the arch, and from the other exits a rim of post-luminous, garlanded normalcy. A crowd emerges from a thousand directions, speaking in unison a language that does not use words but colors, music, and sensations. All speak the fact that they remember this city as a canvas.

The non-humans gather before the archway. Someone in a suit that glimmers like twilight sits on a cushion of thunder. The person holds no id, wearing an attitude not unlike a fearless philosopher. And so, the city sleeps and you are in the wake of its listeners: The one that stops the noise. The Meeting begins to look less like a chair or a room and more like being part of a decision that satellites out of the edges of your own thought. The city is the Customer, The air is the Momentum, The People are the Angles of Opportunity, the Word that returns is the Value of Meeting — which you do not yet fully know.

In an unexpected twist, a sound comes. It’s the sound of a heart speaking and swelling near your chest. You do not realize it was you. The people and the city whisper into the hollow of your chest. “We are here,” they say, “to figure out what matters, more profoundly than a conventional meeting. And you have the power to guide the discourse.” The room dissolves on its edges into a horizon of independent, and a sudden gold light travels across that horizon, like a double experiment. You are now letting the ideas swirl around: Then the morning, when you wake, the lesson will start with unconscious immaturity. The city gets a manifestation. 

You realize that the meeting isn't at a building or a faceted location. It isn't an office or a conference hall inside the city that feels tangible. The meeting is the small confused dent in your mouth dug by philosophical dervishes, by a custom. The meeting is the process where things become unsimple, a conversation in which you achieve relevance. And this dream is the warp.

Your eyelids are suddenly heavy – no time remains in the city. As your muscles relax and your breath settles, they start to rip the wish for a conclusion. The echoes of those whispering voices form a path that laments the theory that you, the dreamer, are the iteration that attends the metaphorical meeting. It is the process to remember that you are the city you manage, that you accept your absolute potential. Then the dream ends. The city dissolves, the mind does walk into the day. You oriented the dream and the meeting and realise that you have been invited to be an alternative; a meeting has happened somewhere away… And the dream is complete. The question ends on the lines of your breathing: “What is the meeting?” It is where the city voices it's all built into the dream itself, in the answers that the future will deliver.
