realize that the walls are subtly shifting behind you, closing off paths you've already taken. The air feels charged with energy, tingling against your skin, as though the maze itself is alive and watching your every move. The further you go, the more the puzzles begin to reflect your own memories and fears.  

At one juncture, you encounter a large marble door engraved with symbols that seem familiar, yet unplaceable. As you run your fingers over the carvings, they… shift under your touch—suddenly becoming images of moments from your childhood. You see yourself standing at a crossroads from your past, a choice you barely even remember making.  

The marble door doesn't open unless you solve its riddle: "Do you move forward, or do you turn back?" The words echo in your mind. A surge of uncertainty washes over you. As you wrestle with the question, the maze dims around you, the light growing faint as if the maze is losing patience, demanding an answer.  

Hesitantly, you move forward, pushing the door open. On the other side, you find yourself in a space that defies logic—it’s both enormous and claustrophobic, both bright and shadowed. A massive clock hangs suspended mid-air, ticking backward. Beneath it, a spiral staircase descends endlessly into darkness.  

To advance, you know you’ll need to "stop the backward time" by solving the next puzzle. The pieces swirl in midair—numbers, shifting shapes, and fragmented words—and as you manipulate them, you discover the fragments form a phrase. It reads: **"You must trust the unknown to escape."**  

Do you descend the staircase into the dark, or try to reverse the flow of time on the clock above? You hesitate. Either choice feels irreversible. What if there’s no right answer?
