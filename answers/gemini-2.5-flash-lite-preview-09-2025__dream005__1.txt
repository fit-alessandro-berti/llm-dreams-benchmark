You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and **each group seems to be performing a silent, highly stylized ritual.**

The air is thick with the scent of unknown spices and old parchment. The room is vast, yet oppressively close, lit by chandeliers that drip not wax, but shimmering, slow-moving honey.

The first group I approach is gathered in a circle. They aren't speaking, but one person, dressed entirely in white linen, is meticulously arranging miniature glass animals on a velvet cloth. As I draw near, they look up, their eyes completely silver, and point, not at me, but at a spot just behind my left ear. They then resume arranging a tiny, perfectly formed glass stag.

I move away quickly, feeling the phantom touch of whatever they pointed at.

The next group is clustered around a long, dark wooden table. They are laughing—a dry, rustling sound like autumn leaves skittering across pavement—but their faces are utterly blank, smooth masks of polished ivory. One person raises a hand, offering me a plate piled high with glistening, purple fruit that smells intensely of rain and ozone. I know instinctively that if I eat it, I will forget why I came here, or perhaps even who I am looking for. I shake my head, and the blank faces turn in unison toward the ceiling, the rustling laughter ceasing instantly.

I push through a curtain made of thousands of dangling, wind-chime keys. On the other side, the atmosphere changes again. Here, people are dancing, but their movements are not coordinated. Each person dances alone, trapped in their own invisible, perfectly defined cube of space. Their movements are beautiful—precise and passionate—but utterly solitary. If they reach the invisible wall of their cube, they simply pivot and begin a new, complex gesture within the boundary. I try to step into the space between two dancers, but I can’t seem to find the space; the dancers seem to occupy the entire volume of air.

Panic begins to prickle at my awareness. *Where is the person I know?* I try to call out their name—but when I open my mouth, the sound that emerges is not a voice, but the clear, resonant note of a tuning fork. The sound makes the honey drip faster from the chandeliers.

Suddenly, all the silent rituals stop. Every silver eye, every blank ivory face, every solitary dancer freezes and turns toward a grand staircase at the far end of the room.

At the top of the staircase stands the person I am looking for. They are not dressed like anyone else; they are wearing a simple, perfectly ordinary blue raincoat, slick with water, though there is no rain inside the hall.

They raise a single hand in a wave.

I start running towards them, navigating the silent tableaux. But as I run, the floor beneath me doesn't stay solid. It begins to ripple, not like water, but like thick, cooling gelatin. My feet sink slightly with every step, and the effort becomes tremendous. The space between me and the staircase stretches impossibly.

Just as I near the bottom step, the person in the blue raincoat smiles—a warm, familiar smile—and then they simply step backward, dissolving *into* the polished mahogany of the staircase itself, leaving behind only the faint, lingering scent of salt air.

And then, the tuning fork sound comes again from my own throat, louder this time, vibrating through the gelatinous floor, and everything snaps into an overwhelming, blinding white light.
