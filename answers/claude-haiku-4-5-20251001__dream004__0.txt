# The Dream Continues

...a paintbrush made of light itself.

The moment I touch it, I understand—I'm not meant to paint *on* the canvas. I *am* the canvas. Every thought becomes a brushstroke. When I think of a mountain, one rises behind me, but it's made of crystallized music. When I imagine sorrow, it pools at my feet as liquid silver that reflects impossible geometries.

A figure approaches—made entirely of doorways. Each door opens onto a different memory, but they're not mine. They're everyone's. The figure doesn't speak, but somehow I know they're asking: *What do you want to create?*

I hesitate, because in the logic of dreams, I realize that choosing one thing means unmade all the others. The landscape around me notices my uncertainty and starts glitching—colors stutter, shapes fold in on themselves impatiently.

So I do something unexpected: I paint the opposite of a choice. I paint the space *between* possibilities. 

The world exhales.

Everything becomes softer. The shifting colors slow to a gentle drift. The doorway-figure smiles (though I don't see a face) and walks backward into themselves, disappearing.

And now I'm curious what happens next...

*What do you see?*
