You are dreaming. You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city, the noise and crowds pressing in around you, making your heart race with unease. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers approaches you, their faces warm and reassuring. They offer to help you find your way, and you gratefully accept, a wave of relief washing over you.

**The Journey Begins**  
The strangers lead you through the winding streets, their calm and friendly presence easing your anxiety. As you walk, the city begins to transform—its sharp edges soften, the chaotic hum fades into a gentle murmur, and the towering buildings seem less intimidating, almost welcoming. The strangers chat lightly among themselves, occasionally glancing back at you with encouraging smiles, as if they know exactly where you need to go.

**A Familiar Destination**  
After what feels like both an instant and an eternity, you arrive at a cozy café tucked into a quiet corner of the city. The moment you step inside, a strange sense of familiarity envelops you. The warm glow of the lights, the scent of freshly brewed coffee, the soft chatter—it all feels like a memory you can’t quite place. Then, you notice a small table in the corner with a handwritten sign bearing your name. The strangers gesture toward it, their smiles widening, a knowing glint in their eyes.

**A Sense of Belonging**  
You sit down, and the strangers nod as if their task is complete. “This is where you were meant to be,” one of them says softly before they turn and fade back into the city. As you settle into the chair, a deep sense of peace washes over you. The café feels like home—a place you didn’t know you were searching for until now. The dream ends with you gazing out the window, the bustling city now a distant, comforting backdrop to the quiet belonging you’ve found.
