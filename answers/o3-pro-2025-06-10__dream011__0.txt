…not ordinary word problems or essay prompts at all.  
Each page pulses like a slow heartbeat, its surface glimmering with ink that rearranges itself whenever you blink.  
The first “question” is a charcoal sketch of a door half-ajar, and beneath it only four words:  

1. OPEN WHAT OPENS YOU?  

Your pen hovers, useless. You try to write “curiosity,” but the letters float off the page like dandelion seeds and vanish. A hush falls over the room; the other students have become silhouettes—black paper cut-outs frozen in mid-scribble.

You turn to the next page.

2. PROVE THAT A CIRCLE CAN REMEMBER.  (Show all work.)  

As you stare, the circular diagram at the center warps into a spinning coin. It lands on its edge and rolls across the desk, leaving behind a silver trail that smells faintly of childhood rain. When it reaches the exam booklet’s margin, it dissolves into an inkwell of reflected memories: a bike wheel, a wedding ring, the orbit of last year’s comet. You suddenly “know” the proof, not in words but in pulses of recognition, and the empty margin fills itself with a spiral of handwritten equations you don’t recall writing.

Page three drips water onto your lap—actual, cold water.

3. IF YOU BREATHE UNDER THIS QUESTION, WHAT WILL YOU EXHALE?  

A miniature ocean is painted across the paper, waves lapping at the edges. You lean closer and the surface parts like curtains; deep below, glowing fish spell out answers in Morse flashes: “Possibility…story…light.” You choose “story,” inhale the salt air, and exhale a flutter of origami boats that sail off the desk and out through the ceiling like gentle meteorites.

The final page is blank except for a mirror square where a question should be. Your own reflection writes in fog:

4. ARE YOU A RESULT OR A CAUSE? (Circle one.)  

You hesitate, then realize the instructions are impossible: it’s not multiple-choice but circular-choice—the two options form a loop chasing its own tail. Instead of circling, you press your palm against the mirror. The glass liquefies, and you fall forward…

…into the hallway outside the classroom. The clock above the door reads 9:00 AM—one minute before the exam was scheduled to begin. Your booklet is gone, but your hand is still damp with salt water and silver ink. A proctor strides by and asks if you’re ready. You glance back; the classroom is just an ordinary room now, fluorescent lights buzzing, no silhouettes, no pulsing pages.

“I already took it,” you say, surprised at how certain you sound.  
The proctor smiles as if that answer is perfectly acceptable.  
Somewhere a bell rings—a sound exactly halfway between a start and a finish—and you wake up, heart steady, mind oddly clear, carrying the quiet conviction that whatever career comes next, you have already opened what opens you.
