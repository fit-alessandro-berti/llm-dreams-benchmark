symbols etched into the surface of the box. The patterns seem to shift and change under your gaze, almost as if they are alive, whispering secrets in a language you can’t quite understand. You run your fingers over the carvings, and a faint, warm glow begins to emanate from the box, pulsing like a heartbeat. 

Suddenly, the air around you grows heavy, and a soft, melodic hum fills the space. The ground beneath your feet vibrates gently, and you feel an inexplicable pull toward the box, as if it’s calling to you. You notice a small indentation on the top of the box, shaped like a handprint. Without thinking, you press your palm against it. The glow intensifies, and the box begins to tremble.

A voice, ancient and echoing, speaks from nowhere and everywhere at once: “Only the worthy may claim what lies within. Prove your heart.” The box clicks, and the lid cracks open just enough for a sliver of blinding light to escape. You feel a rush of emotions—fear, curiosity, longing—as the light wraps around you like a warm breeze. 

Before you can decide whether to open it fully, the dream shifts. You’re no longer in the same place. You’re standing in a vast, misty forest, the box still in your hands. The trees around you are impossibly tall, their branches weaving together to form a canopy that blocks out the sky. Strange, luminescent creatures flit through the air, watching you with glowing eyes. The voice speaks again: “Choose your path. The key lies in your truth.”

You look down at the box, and the handprint indentation is now gone, replaced by three small slots, each shaped differently—one a circle, one a triangle, and one a square. Scattered around you in the forest are three objects: a round stone, a triangular shard of crystal, and a square piece of metal, each glowing faintly with the same light as the box. You sense that choosing the wrong object might have consequences, but the voice offers no further guidance.

You reach for one of the objects, your heart pounding as you make your choice. As your fingers close around it, the forest begins to dissolve, and a wave of energy surges through you. The box in your other hand grows warm again, and the slot corresponding to your chosen object begins to shimmer. You place the object into the slot, and with a resounding click, the box unlocks fully.

The lid swings open, revealing a swirling vortex of light and shadow inside. The voice returns, softer this time: “You have chosen. Step forward and claim your destiny.” You hesitate, peering into the vortex, feeling both drawn to it and afraid of what lies beyond. As you take a tentative step closer, the dream begins to fade, the edges of the forest blurring into darkness. The last thing you hear is the voice whispering, “Remember…”

And then you wake up, the sensation of the box still lingering in your hands, the voice echoing in your mind, leaving you with a strange mix of wonder and unease. What was inside the vortex? What did the voice mean by “remember”? The dream feels unfinished, as if it’s waiting for you to return.
