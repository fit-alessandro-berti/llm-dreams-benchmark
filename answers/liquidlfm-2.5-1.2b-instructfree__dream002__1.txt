As you continue walking through the lush canopy, a gentle tapestry of sunlight filters through the leaves, casting shifting patterns on the forest floor. The air is crisp and fresh, with a faint whisper of wind rustling through the branches. You pause, listening closely, and hear a soft murmur in your mind—a distant voice, not your own.

Suddenly, the peace breaks. The sky darkens rapidly, and the air grows heavy with tension. Dark clouds gather, and the storm comes faster than you expected. Rain begins to fall—first light drops, then heavy and unrelenting. You feel a surge of adrenaline as the wind picks up, carrying the scent of rain and earth.

You exhale deeply, helmet-style, and step deeper into the forest. The trees seem to lean closer, their branches forming a sheltered canopy above. You clutch the edges of the leaves, hoping to shelter from the storm. A soft gust brushes past, carrying with it the sound of breathing—perhaps yours, or the wind itself.

Just when it feels dire, a flicker of hope bursts through the darkness. A light sources itself in the distance—perhaps a fire, a beam of lightning, or a glowing orb rising from the shadows. The storm begins to subside, revealing a warm, golden glow. The rain softens, and a gentle breeze brushes your face.

You finally stand at the edge of a clearing, where the storm has passed and the forest is alive with new sounds—chirping birds, rustling leaves, and the distant sound of laughter. You smile, knowing that even in the most unexpected moments, there is always a way forward.

And in the stillness of the dream, you are safe.
