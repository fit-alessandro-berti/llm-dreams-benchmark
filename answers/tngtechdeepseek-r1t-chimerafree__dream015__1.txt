**Dream Completion:**  
Despite the hardships, you decide to follow the faint radio signal crackling through the static of an old handheld device. It leads you toward the jagged silhouette of mountains, where whispers of a hidden community persist—a place where firelight still flickers against the encroaching darkness. The journey is fraught with peril: scavengers prowl the ruins, the air stings with ash, and every shadow seems to hold a threat. Yet, beneath your weariness burns a stubborn ember of hope. Something in that distant signal feels like a thread tying you to humanity’s fragile resilience, and you cling to it, step by step, as the world holds its breath.
