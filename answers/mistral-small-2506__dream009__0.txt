**Dream Continuation:**

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to survive in this unfamiliar world.

The air smells of damp earth and woodsmoke, and the distant sound of birds and rustling leaves fills the silence. You’re dressed in simple, rough-spun clothing—nothing like what you wore before. Your hands are calloused, as if you’ve been working the land for years.

A village lies ahead, nestled between rolling hills and a dense forest. The people here move with purpose, their faces weathered by time and labor. They speak in a language you don’t understand, but their gestures suggest a life of farming, trade, and survival.

You have no money, no identification, and no way to explain where you came from. The only thing you know for sure is that you must find a way to belong—or at least stay alive.

**What do you do?**

1. **Approach the village cautiously**, hoping to find work or shelter.
2. **Search for food and water in the wilderness**, avoiding human contact for now.
3. **Look for clues about this era**—maybe a market, a temple, or an elder who might know more.
4. **Try to communicate through gestures**, offering help in exchange for food or a place to stay.

The choice is yours. What path will you take?
