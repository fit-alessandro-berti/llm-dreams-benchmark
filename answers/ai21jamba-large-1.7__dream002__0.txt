the wind begins to howl, rustling the leaves and bending the trees. Dark clouds roll in, blotting out the sun, and you feel a chill crawl up your spine. Lightning crackles in the distance, followed by a rumble of thunder that shakes the ground beneath your feet. The air grows heavy with electricity, and for a moment, everything goes unnaturally quiet.

Suddenly, a torrential downpour begins, drenching you in seconds. The rain stings as it lashes your face, forcing you to squint and seek shelter. There, ahead, is a small, moss-covered cabin, half-hidden among the trees. You make a dash for it, your boots slipping in the mud, heart pounding with urgency.

You reach the door and turn the handle. It creaks open, revealing a dimly lit interior with a flickering fire in the corner. As you step inside, the storm outside intensifies, but here, for now, you are safe.
