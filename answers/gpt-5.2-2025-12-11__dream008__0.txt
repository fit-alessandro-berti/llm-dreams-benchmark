…you nod like you understand, but your hands feel full of sand. The office around you sharpens and blurs at the same time—rows of desks stretching farther than they should, computer monitors glowing with the same blank document: **UNTITLED**.

Your boss doesn’t blink. “You can start now,” they say, tapping a watch that has no hands.

You sit at your desk and open the project brief. It’s only one page, but the text keeps rearranging itself. Every time you try to read a sentence, it slides away like a fish. The deadline at the top reads **DUE: YESTERDAY**, then **DUE: NOW**, then **DUE: BEFORE YOU THINK ABOUT IT**.

You decide to do the simplest thing: write the first line. Your fingers hover over the keyboard, but the keys aren’t letters anymore—they’re tiny elevator buttons: **B1, 2, 17, 99**. You press one at random.

The floor beneath your chair drops.

Instead of falling, you glide—smooth and quiet—down through layers of the building that aren’t on any map. Each level is your workplace, but slightly wrong. On one floor everyone is wearing the same face—your face—smiling politely at screens. On another, the meeting rooms are aquariums and people speak in bubbles that pop before they reach the glass.

A chime sounds. The chair stops at a hallway lined with filing cabinets as tall as trees. Their drawers are labeled with things that aren’t files:

**MISPLACED CONFIDENCE**  
**EMAILS YOU DIDN’T SEND**  
**QUESTIONS YOU DIDN’T ASK**  
**TIME YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD**

At the end of the hallway is a door with your boss’s name on it, except the letters keep sliding around to spell different words: **BOSS / OBS / SOB / OBSERVE**.

You open it.

Inside is a conference room set for a presentation. A projector hums, aimed at a screen that’s already filled with charts and bullet points you don’t remember making. Every seat is occupied by people from your life—coworkers, friends, strangers from the bus stop, your high school teacher—each holding a copy of the project, flipping through it like they’re looking for you between the pages.

Your boss stands by the screen with a laser pointer, waiting.

You try to explain you haven’t started. But when you speak, your voice comes out as the sound of Outlook sending an email—soft whoosh after soft whoosh.

Someone in the front row clears their throat. It’s you, but older, wearing a lanyard and an expression you recognize from sleepless nights. Older You leans over and whispers, “Don’t build the whole thing. Build the part that proves it can exist.”

The projector flickers. The slides go blank.

Your boss says, very calmly, “Begin.”

You look down at the copy of the project in your hands. It’s heavy, like a brick. You open it to the first page and see something new: a simple checkbox list, handwritten.

- **Define what ‘done’ means (one sentence).**  
- **Make one real example.**  
- **Show it to someone.**  

There’s a pen clipped to the spine. You take it, and the moment you touch it, the room quiets—like the building is holding its breath.

You write a sentence under “done,” and the letters glow faintly. The pen feels warmer, steadier, like it’s connected to the floor. The filing cabinets outside stop rattling. The people in the seats lean in.

You flip to the next page and sketch one example—just one. A rough diagram, a few lines, imperfect but present. As soon as you finish, the projector turns back on by itself and displays your sketch huge on the screen, slightly shaky, unmistakably yours.

A murmur ripples through the room—approval, curiosity, relief.

Your boss’s expression doesn’t change, but the watch in their hand suddenly has hands again. They look at it, surprised, as if time has returned without permission.

“Continue,” they say, but the word isn’t sharp anymore. It’s almost normal.

You glance at Older You, who gives a small nod. The chairs stop feeling like they’re bolted to the floor. The air tastes less like printer toner and more like morning.

You stand up, project in hand, and walk toward the screen.

And as you do, the impossible deadline on the cover quietly rewrites itself into something you can breathe:

**DUE: NEXT STEP.**

The lights dim. The room fades.

You wake up with your heart racing and the strange, lingering certainty that you’ve forgotten something important—but also that you know exactly where to start.
