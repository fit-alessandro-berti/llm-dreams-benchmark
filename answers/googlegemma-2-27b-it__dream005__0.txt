...overhear snippets of conversations that swirl around me like leaves in a whirlwind. One group, clad in shimmering emerald green gowns and towering hairdos, debates the merits of a dress code they consider "far too formal for this dystopian hellscape we call modern life." Their voices, though, are light and airy, untouched by the oppressive weight of social anxiety swirling around me. I duck my head, shrinking further into the anonymity of the party.

The host, Jeremiah, greets me. He's wearing a sapphire blue velvet suit, seemingly untouched by the dust and grime that cling to the exposed steel beams above the heads of the remaining, albeit increasingly boisterous, guests. He seems to have... changed. His jolly smile has vanished, replaced by a grim tightness around his lips. His eyes, once twinkling with playful cheer, are now shadowed, his usual affable charisma replaced with a disconcerting intensity.

"You'll find more excitement over there," Jeremiah says, gesturing to a dimly lit corner where two men in dark, hooded cloaks are huddled. There's a package between them, a small heartbeat visible beneath its thick wax seal.

Driven by a morbid curiosity, I follow his gaze. The pulsating rhythm of the pulsing glow in the corner catches my attention. One of the cloaked figures, face hidden in the shadows, flips open a polished silver case. Inside isn't the mechanical contraption I was expecting. It's a holographic projector, its smooth surface flickering with life as it activates, revealing a swirling vortex of...  a vibrant, living forest! 

...a vibrant, but dead, silent forest of silent sound and shimmering lights, projected within the confines of the shimmering silver case. My phone jolts in my pocket as a familiar melody begins to play - a haunting lullaby I remember from childhood, played by a rapidly flashing display of green vines. 

As I approach this sliver of the wilderness emanating from the silver case, caught in its captivating luminescence, I can't believe my eyes. The forest had been just another cluster of pixels in my dream before, but now it's alive with color and detail.

It's beautiful, each leaf rustling with silent life, the lush hologram teeming with shimmering detail within the metallic walls.


It's a strange contrast to the crude, metal and concrete aesthetic of 

the rest of the dream landscape - the sparse space, the humming drone of the servers, the trapped, flickering woods beyond the polished, cool walls of my gilded cage.

Inside the case, a small, wooden cabin materialized, bathed in the

soft, emerald glow. Beyond it, the forest pulsed and shimmered, with trees that stretched their branches through the shimmering space, but as I watched, a group of flickering sub-zero logging drones, cold and metallic, flew past the brass-plated mirror that served as the window to this forest. 

The men in the corner, dressed in their uncomfortable blanket attire huddled around the glowing, snow-globe-like scene of birch trees, frosty pines, and delicate glass rivers. I waited and watched, heart pounding. It fascinated

me. What were the metallic men doing in a forest made of rainbows and

sparkling dust? The despair was back. They stood in flamboyant suits, looking out of place amongst the swirling blotches of light reenacting a Northern Lights show, their low whispers echoing strangely

in the echoing silence of the dream.
