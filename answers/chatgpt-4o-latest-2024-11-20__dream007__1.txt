take a deep breath and step back for a moment. The words between the two of you hang heavy in the air, thick with emotion and misunderstanding. Your friend's voice trembles as they try to make their point, but you’re so consumed by your own perspective that it’s hard to hear them clearly.

You find yourself suddenly aware of your surroundings. You're not in a familiar place—you're standing in a vast, open field bathed in warm, golden light. The sunlight casts strange, shifting patterns on the tall grass, and in the distance, you notice a small wooden bench beneath a single massive tree. A gentle breeze carries the faint sound of laughter, though neither of you is laughing.

"I can’t do this anymore," your friend says, their voice breaking slightly. Their words echo in a way that feels unnatural, almost dreamlike. It occurs to you then—wait a minute. This *is* a dream.

The realization jolts you. You take a step back and look at your friend, but now their features are shifting, melting into someone else’s face. Or is it your own face? It’s hard to tell. The argument you were having moments ago feels irrelevant now, a distant memory of something that doesn’t quite matter in this ethereal, surreal space.

“What do you want me to say?” your friend asks, their voice now layered with tones that don’t match. It feels as though the question isn’t just coming from them—it’s coming from the field, the tree, the very air around you.

You pause, feeling the weight of the moment. The argument no longer feels important, but the connection between you does. You sit down on the grass, gesturing for your friend to join you. “Maybe we don’t need to say anything,” you reply, surprising yourself with the calm clarity in your voice.

As your friend sits beside you, the golden light grows brighter, almost blinding. The field begins to fade, and for a moment, you feel an overwhelming sense of peace, as if an unspoken understanding has passed between you both.

And then—just like that—you wake up. The lingering emotions from the dream stay with you. You pick up your phone and consider calling your friend, realizing that maybe the dream was telling you something you hadn’t been ready to admit before.
