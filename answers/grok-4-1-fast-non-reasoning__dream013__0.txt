You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, you encounter riddles etched into glowing stone walls, whispering voices that echo forgotten theorems, and shifting floors that demand perfect spatial reasoning to cross.

One puzzle blocks your path: a massive door inscribed with symbols forming a cryptographic lock. You decipher it by recognizing it's a Caesar cipher shifted by the Fibonacci sequence—unlocking panels that reveal a lever. Pulling it floods the room with holographic equations; solving the quadratic riddle (x² - 5x + 6 = 0, factoring to (x-2)(x-3)) aligns floating mirrors, bending light to open the next corridor.

Deeper still, the air thickens with illusions—optical paradoxes like the Penrose triangle stairs that loop infinitely until you prove their impossibility via Euclidean geometry. Shadows morph into logic gates; you wire an AND-NOT circuit with movable tiles to dispel them, revealing a chasm bridged by a pressure-plate balance puzzle. Weights correspond to prime numbers—2, 3, 5, 7—calibrated precisely to counterbalance your steps across.

At the heart, the final enigma awaits: a spherical orb pulsing with fractal patterns. It demands deducing the Mandelbrot set's escape-time algorithm, iterating z_{n+1} = z_n² + c until divergence, which stabilizes the chaos and unveils the maze's core—a shimmering dream fountain. Drinking from it, you awaken, the puzzles dissolving into clarity, carrying their logic into your waking mind.
