You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and—each time you approach—one dissolves like mist, reforming into something stranger.

First, a circle of elderly women in sequined hats peddle teacups filled with animated constellations. “Sugar’s in the stars tonight,” one whispers, offering you a sip. The tea hums, and for a second, you remember your grandmother’s laugh—but she’s been gone ten years. You swallow. The stars twirl inside your chest.

Next, a group of children in upside-down suits juggle floating clocks. One drops a pocket watch. It shatters, and instead of gears, a chorus of whispering voices spills out: *“You were supposed to say hello.”* You pick up the largest shard—it’s shaped like your own face, cracked but smiling.

Then, a man in a trench coat made of shifting maps leans against a pillar, smoking a cigarette that burns blue. “You’re looking for Leo,” he says without looking up. “He’s not here. He’s on the other side of the mirror you haven’t opened yet.” He gestures to a wall you hadn’t noticed—covered in hundreds of gleaming, unframed mirrors, each reflecting a version of you: one blurry with tears, one laughing on a rooftop, one asleep on a beach under twin moons.

You turn away, heart pounding, and bump into a woman holding a single balloon in the shape of a key.

“Have you seen Leo?” you ask, voice shaky.

She smiles gently. “I’m Leo.”

The balloon drifts upward, and the room exhales.

All the groups vanish. The lights dim. The music stops. And you’re standing alone in a cavernous, gold-flecked hall… except now you see him—your one friend—sitting on a staircase, reading a book titled *The Dream You Forgot You Were Having*.

He looks up.

“You’re late,” he says. “I’ve been waiting since you left your keys by the sink this morning.”

And then—you wake up.

In your bed.

Your keys are still by the sink.

And your phone glows with a text from Leo—

> *Hey. You okay? You looked so far away at dinner. I was worried you’d disappear.*
