...wrong.

Not wrong as in marked with red ink or trick phrasing, but wrong as in they don't belong to this room, this desk, this version of you. Half of them are written in your own childhood handwriting, letters backwards, the e's and a's fat and round. One simply says, in purple crayon, "What did you want to be before you knew what money was?" Another is typed in a font you recognize from your grandmother's recipe cards: "Describe the smell of rain when you were nine." A third isn't a question at all but a blank line above the word NAME, and when you look closely you realize it's your signature, already there in looping cursive, dated ten years from now.

You flip the page. The pages multiply. There are questions in languages you don't speak, in symbols that look like the constellations you used to trace on your ceiling. There is a page with nothing on it but a mirror, and for a moment your own face glints back at you with someone else's eyes. The clock at the front of the hall ticks backward, then forward, then simply spins like a compass with no north.

Your classmates have become silhouettes, their pencil scratches like rain in the distance. The proctor has no face you can hold onto; he is your father when you glance up, your high school art teacher when you glance again, a stranger the next. He clears his throat and says, "You have as much time as you think you have," and his voice echoes in a cathedral and in a cave.

Your heart hammers because there was nothing about smeared crayon letters or future signatures in your notes. You studied formulas and definitions, case law and CAD drawings. No amount of highlighting prepared you to be asked, "Who do you forgive?" in a box labeled Extra Credit.

One of the questions asks you to choose between four pictures: a white coat, a gavel, a paintbrush, a pair of hands planting a sapling. You reach for the pencil and it droops like soft wax. When you try to shade in a circle, the paper ripples like water and your mark expands into a wide ink spill. In its reflection, you see a small you in a cardboard spaceship, declaring to anyone who would listen that you were going to be an astronaut-cowboy-chef.

A tickle of lucidity crawls up your spine. Of course. Of course the exam would be all the things you cannot rehearse. The questions are shifting because you're shifting. You press your palm to the blank page and words rise to meet it like braille: "How do you wake yourself up?"

You laugh, because you finally have an answer you know. You put your pencil down. You stand. The chair isn't there anymore; it's a patch of grass. The ceiling of the exam hall opens up into sky. The proctor-parents-teacher-stranger nods as if you've turned something in that was owed.

You take a breath, the kind of breath that fills your lungs with morning light, and you feel the cheap paper of the test melt between your fingers like sugar. Somewhere far away, an alarm begins to trill. You blink, and the classroom, the desks, the soft-blunting pencil all dissolve into your own bedroom ceiling, the taste of rain and crayon still on your tongue, and for a moment you can still hear the question echoing: What did you want to be?
