...and you close your eyes.

The roar of the wind and the crash of the waves do not cease, but they change. The chaos becomes a symphony. You can feel the deep, resonant groan of the ship's timbers not as a cry of pain, but as the bass note of a cello. The shriek of the wind through the rigging is a frantic, soaring violin. The rain, hammering the deck, is a thousand tiny drums.

Your crew is still looking at you, their faces pale in the flashes of green lightning, but their fear is slowly being replaced by a profound confusion. You don't shout an order. You don't grab the wheel. You simply begin to hum, a low, steady tune that weaves itself into the storm's music.

A wave, a mountain of dark water that should have splintered the mast, crests over the bow. But it is not cold. It is warm, like tea, and it smells of cinnamon and forgotten attics. It washes over the deck not with violence, but with a gentle caress, and where it touches the ropes, they glow with a soft, phosphorescent light.

You open your eyes. The sea is no longer water, but a rolling landscape of dark, crushed velvet. The storm clouds are not gray, but a swirl of peacock feathers, and the moon, impossibly large, hangs in the sky like a pearl button.

Your first mate, a man with a beard full of salt and sea-damp wool, steps forward. "Captain?" he asks, his voice barely a whisper. "What are your orders?"

You look at him, at your crew, at the impossible, beautiful chaos around you. You point not towards a safe harbor, but towards the very heart of the storm, where the lightning is brightest and the music is loudest.

"Set a course for the crescendo," you say, and your voice is the calmest thing in the world. "We have a performance to attend."
