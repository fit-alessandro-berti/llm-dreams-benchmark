...a faint, almost imperceptible hum emanating from within. The patterns aren't random; they seem to shift and flow like liquid metal under your gaze, telling a silent, ancient story.

Your fingers, moving with a will of their own, begin to trace the grooves and ridges. As you do, the humming grows slightly louder, a resonant thrum that you feel in your bones. A single, cool point on the surface begins to glow with a soft, blue light.

Driven by a dream-logic you understand perfectly, you press your palm flat against that glowing point. The intricate patterns flare with light, racing along the lines you just traced. The box doesn't click or pop open. Instead, the solid lid becomes translucent, then vanishes entirely, revealing not a hollow space, but a swirling vortex of stars and nebulae—a tiny, captured universe.

From the center of this cosmic swirl, a single, luminous key floats gently into your waiting hand. It is warm to the touch and hums in harmony with the box. You understand, without being told, that this key doesn't lock or unlock anything physical. It is the key to the next part of the dream itself.
