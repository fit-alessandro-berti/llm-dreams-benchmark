…push forward into the unknown, driven by a stubborn flame of hope that refuses to die. The air smells of rust and ash, the sky a bruised palette of purples and sickly oranges. Crumbling ruins stretch out before you, silent reminders of what the world used to be. You hear the wind whistling through collapsed high-rises, carrying faint whispers that could be voices—or perhaps just the ghosts of memory.

Despite the emptiness, you decide to search for signs of life. Slinging your worn satchel over your shoulder, you begin walking toward the skeletal silhouette of a once-thriving city. Along the way, you scavenge what little you can—a dented canteen, a cracked photograph of strangers smiling, a shard of mirror that reflects your tired eyes back at you.

The farther you go, the more the ruins seem to change. Some buildings are covered in unfamiliar moss that glows faintly in the dim light. You hear a faint rhythmic sound—it could be the ticking of an old machine, or the heartbeat of something alive deep within the wreckage.

You reach a crossroads: one path leads deeper into the city’s heart, where shadows move strangely between broken windows; the other leads toward the outskirts, where you think you see firelight flickering in the distance.

Where do you go? Into the city’s heart, or toward the distant fire?
