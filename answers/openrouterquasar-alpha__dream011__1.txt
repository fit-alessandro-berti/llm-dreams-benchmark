...written in a language you don't recognize. The letters twist and reshape themselves every time you try to focus. An uneasy feeling settles in your chest as the clock on the wall begins to tick louder…and faster. You flip through the exam pages in vain, hoping some questions will suddenly make sense, but instead, the words swirl together like ink in water.

Suddenly, your classmates around you start scribbling confidently, their faces calm and assured. You feel panic rising — until you realize that somehow, beneath the chaos of the letters, there’s a faint glow. As you concentrate on this glow, the jumble of symbols slowly resolves into familiar words. The questions shift and reveal themselves as problems you know how to solve — topics you’ve mastered before.

You breathe easier and pick up your pen, ready at last to begin. The ticking clock slows to a gentle rhythm, guiding you steadily through the answers. When you finally glance up, the exam room's harsh walls have softened, replaced by a comforting, sunlit landscape — and you realize that passing the exam was never the true test. It was finding calm amid confusion, trusting yourself, and seeing beyond the initial chaos that mattered all along.
