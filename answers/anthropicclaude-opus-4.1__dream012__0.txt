...raise your voice above the howling wind, but the words that emerge are not your own—they are the sea's ancient language, salt and foam. Your crew's faces ripple like water, and you realize they are not people at all, but memories you've pulled from the depths.

The ship's wheel turns to driftwood in your hands, sprouting tiny barnacles that whisper navigation secrets. "The storm isn't around us," you tell your crew-memories, "we're inside its eye, and it's dreaming too."

Lightning strikes the mast, but instead of fire, it blooms into a tree of pure light, its branches reaching down rather than up. The deck beneath your feet becomes transparent—below, an upside-down sky full of fish swimming through clouds.

Your first mate, who now has your mother's eyes, hands you a compass that points not north, but to "home," and the needle spins wildly because home is everywhere and nowhere in this boundless sea. 

The storm laughs with your childhood voice, and you remember: you were never the captain. You were always the ship itself, carrying yourself through waves of time, and your crew was every person you've ever been...

The horizon folds like origami, and suddenly you're sailing through the inside of a seashell, the sound of your own heartbeat echoing off its spiral walls.
