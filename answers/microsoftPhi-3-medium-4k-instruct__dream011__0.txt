 Unfortunately, you're dreaming, which means that nothing is set in stone, and therefore, the outcome of this final exam – and its consequences on your future – aren't predetermined. The questions that appear before you seem rather peculiar. Instead of typical exam questions, they're in the form of riddles. 

The first riddle reads, "Forward I am heavy, but backward I am not. What am I?"

Feeling a rush of adrenaline, you quickly jot down your answer, "ton." With the initial question successfully tackled, you feel a boost of confidence running through your veins.

The second riddle challenges you with, "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

You take a moment to process the clues, and soon enough you respond with, "an echo." Your excitement for this dream exam keeps growing by the moment.

The third riddle appears, stating, "I am not alive, yet I grow; I don't have lungs, yet I need air; I don't have a mouth, yet I can drown."

As you ponder upon the riddle, the answer becomes clear, and you answer, "fire." You pay attention to each question and use the power of your intuition and knowledge.

The atmosphere in the dream becomes serene, each riddle bringing you closer to discovering your true potential. As you continue to solve each riddle, answering questions not just based on your academic knowledge, but also reflecting your ability to think creatively and adapt, you pass this unique exam with flying colors.

The dream exam, set in a surreal environment, embraces you with a palpable sense of accomplishment and a newfound self-belief. As you wake up, you carry these positive feelings with you into your waking life, determined to tackle any challenge with grace and resilience.
