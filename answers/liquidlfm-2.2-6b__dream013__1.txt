...start to see patterns emerging. The walls aren't just walls—they're shifting, reacting to your focus, revealing hidden symbols in the flickering light. One puzzle, in particular, catches me. It's a spiral—a staircase that leads nowhere, then somewhere, depending on the angle. The solution isn't just a number or a turn, but a memory, a feeling, something abstract you get *right*.  

As I touch it, a door slides open not toward a new labyrinthine corridor, but toward a library—*a maze within a maze*. Shelves of pulsating books unfold like flower petals, each containing a different version of me, trapped in their own loops of puzzles. One says, *"Find the puzzle that shows all the others asleep."*  

I feel another presence watching from the shadows—a guide, or a reminder. The maze isn't just a test of mind, but a test of self. To escape, I must finally let go of the need to control the puzzles, and instead, *become* the maze, seeing it not as an obstacle, but as a reflection of my own tangled thoughts.  

And then—light. Not a harsh glow, but a warm, golden clarity. The maze dissolves, the puzzles dissolve, and I’m standing on a plain? Or am I still inside the maze, but the rules have changed?  

**Final detail:** The door behind me creaks open again—but it’s not a door. It’s a mirror. I don’t recognize myself looking back.  

What happens next?
