You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you hesitate—partly because the city’s chaos hums in your ears, and partly because you’re not sure if trust is something you can afford. But their voices are steady, their eyes kind, and they gesture for you to follow.  

They lead you through winding alleys where the hum of the city softens into a murmur, past neon signs that flicker like fireflies, until you arrive at a small plaza tucked between two tall buildings. A fountain in the center glows faintly, its water shimmering with colors that shift like emotions. The strangers sit you down on a bench nearby, and one of them—a woman with silver-streaked hair and a scarf that seems to ripple like water—hands you a map. But it’s not a regular map. It’s made of paper that feels alive, its lines pulsing with a faint heartbeat.  

“You’re looking for something,” the woman says, her voice gentle, as if she’s not speaking to you but to the city itself.  

You blink, surprised. “I… I’m not sure. I just feel lost.”  

The man next to her, who smells faintly of lavender and rain, smiles. “Then maybe you’re looking for the right place to begin.” He taps the map, and the lines shift, forming a path that leads not to a destination but to a door—half-hidden behind a curtain of ivy.  

Curiosity wins over caution. You step through, and the air changes. It’s still the city, but softened, as if time has paused. The strangers fade, their forms blending into the light, and you’re alone again… yet no longer lost. You realize the map’s heartbeat matches your own, and the path you walked was always there, waiting for you to notice.  

When you wake, the city’s noise is louder, but for a moment, you remember the glow of the fountain, the scent of lavender, and the quiet certainty that even in chaos, you are never truly alone.
