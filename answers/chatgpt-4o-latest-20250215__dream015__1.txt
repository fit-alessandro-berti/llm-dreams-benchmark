venture into the ruins of an old city, searching for supplies and perhaps a glimpse of civilization. The streets are cracked, overgrown with vines and moss, as nature reclaims what was once a bustling metropolis. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and rusted metal.

As you navigate the skeletal remains of buildings, you hear the distant howl of wind through shattered windows—except, something about it feels... off. It isn’t just the wind. You pause, scanning the shadows, your heart pounding. 

Then, movement.

A flicker of motion behind a burned-out car. Your grip tightens on the makeshift weapon in your hand—a rusted crowbar you scavenged earlier. You take a step forward, careful not to disturb the shattered glass beneath your boots.

"Who's there?" you call out, your voice hoarse from days of rationed water.

Silence.

Then, a low, rasping breath. 

Emerging from the shadows is a figure, wrapped in tattered clothing, their face obscured by a cracked gas mask. Their posture isn’t threatening—if anything, they seem just as wary of you as you are of them.

"You’re not one of them," the stranger finally says, voice muffled through the mask. 

"One of who?" you ask.

A long pause. Then, the stranger tilts their head slightly. 

"You don’t know yet, do you?" 

Before you can ask what they mean, a chilling, guttural shriek echoes through the ruins. The stranger stiffens.

"They found us," they whisper. "We need to move. Now."

And just like that, your dream shifts. The ruins blur, the sky darkens, and the world twists into something even stranger. 

What happens next?
