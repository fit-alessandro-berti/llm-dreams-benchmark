As you step onto the stage, the lights dim slightly, casting a golden haze over the crowd. The air hums with anticipation—some faces are eager, others curious, a few even wary. You take a deep breath, feeling the weight of the moment, but also a strange, warm current running through you, as if the stage itself is alive with possibility.

Then, something unexpected happens: the words you *thought* you were going to say dissolve into something else entirely. The first line that comes out of your mouth isn’t what you rehearsed—it’s a question, soft but electric:

**"What if the thing we’ve all been waiting for… isn’t a solution, but a question?"**

The crowd stills. A murmur ripples through the rows. You pause, letting the silence stretch like a thread between you and them. Then, without planning it, you begin to speak—not in the polished, rehearsed cadence you’d prepared, but in a voice that feels *true*, as if the words are being whispered into your ear by something larger than yourself.

You describe a dream you had last night: a vast, shifting library where the books rearranged themselves when you touched them, and the pages inside were made of starlight. The audience leans in, some reaching for their pens, others just staring, mesmerized. You talk about how fear isn’t the opposite of courage—it’s the shadow that makes courage *visible*. You tell them about the time you got lost in a city that didn’t exist on any map, and how the path forward only became clear when you stopped trying to find your way.

Then, the lights flicker. A single spotlight shifts to the back of the room, where a figure stands—tall, cloaked, their face obscured by shadow. They raise a hand, and suddenly, the air *shimmers*. The figure speaks, but their voice isn’t heard—it’s *felt*, like the hum of a tuning fork against your bones. **"You were never meant to answer. You were meant to ask."**

The crowd gasps. The figure vanishes. The lights return to normal. You blink, disoriented—but then you realize: the speech you gave wasn’t just *yours*. It was a bridge. And now, the audience isn’t just listening. They’re *seeing*.

As you step off the stage, a child in the front row holds up a small, glowing object—a key, maybe?—and whispers, **"You’re not done yet."**

The dream dissolves into the sound of your own laughter, warm and unfamiliar, as the stage disappears behind you… and you wake up, heart racing, with the faintest imprint of starlight on your palm.
