...notice the walls themselves seem to breathe, expanding and contracting with a slow, rhythmic pulse, as though the maze is a living thing — and perhaps it is.

The first puzzle was simple enough: a door with rotating symbols that needed to align in a specific sequence. You solved it by recognizing that the symbols corresponded to prime numbers arranged in a spiral pattern. The door dissolved like smoke.

The second puzzle was harder. A floor of pressure plates, each engraved with fragments of a sentence in a language you somehow *almost* understand — the way you almost understand things in dreams. You stood very still, reading the fragments, and slowly realized the sentence only made sense if you walked it *backwards*, heel to toe, from the period to the capital letter.

Now you stand before the third puzzle, and something has shifted.

The walls here are covered in **mirrors**, but they don't reflect you correctly. Each mirror shows a different version — one where you're older, one where you're a child, one where you're made entirely of light, one where you're simply *absent*, the maze empty and still behind your missing silhouette.

At the center of the mirrored chamber is a pedestal. On the pedestal sits a single object:

**A locked box made of glass.**

Inside the glass box, clearly visible, is a key. And the key, you somehow understand with complete dream-logic certainty, **opens the glass box itself.**

There is a note beside it.

*"The solution is not entry. The solution is understanding why you want what's already visible."*

You stare at it for a long moment.

The mirrors flicker. The version of you made of light steps *forward* in its reflection, pressing a luminous hand against the glass from the inside — not trapped, you realize, but *waiting*.

And slowly, with the peculiar certainty that only dreams allow, you understand:

The box was never locked.

You had assumed the lock because there *was* a lock — gleaming, prominent, designed to be seen. But locks, your dreaming mind whispers, are sometimes **decoration**. Sometimes they are the puzzle itself, not the obstacle *before* the puzzle.

You reach out. Not for the lock. Not for a latch.

You simply **lift the lid**.

It swings open silently.

The key inside is warm when you pick it up. It hums faintly, like a tuning fork struck against the frequency of something important, and when you close your fingers around it, the mirrors all shift at once — every version of you smiling, even the absent one, whose empty space somehow *radiates* satisfaction.

The far wall opens.

Beyond it, the maze continues — deeper, stranger, more beautiful than before. The next chamber glows with a soft blue light, and you can already see shapes moving in it, puzzles assembling themselves in real time, *curious* about you the way you are curious about them.

You step forward.

The maze breathes.

So do you.
