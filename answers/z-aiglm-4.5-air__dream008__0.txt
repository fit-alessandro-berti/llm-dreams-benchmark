Your boss is waiting for you to **start**, but as you open your mouth to speak, you realize *no sound comes out*. The room around you begins to warp: fluorescent lights flicker like dying stars, the hum of computers warps into a low, oppressive drone, and the stacks of paperwork on your desk seem to multiply, cascading into impossible, teetering towers.  

Your boss’s mouth is moving – you can see their lips shaping words like *"I need this by 5 PM"* – but the silence is absolute. You try to reach for your keyboard, but your fingers pass right through it. The monitor screen glitches, displaying only a rapidly shrinking countdown timer: **00:59:59... 00:59:58...**  

Suddenly, the walls *vibrate*. Not physically, but emotionally – a cold dread seeps into your bones. You glance at the calendar on the wall: today’s date is smudged, blurred into illegibility, while the deadline is circled in jagged, frantic red that seems to bleed onto the air itself.  

You turn to face your boss again, but now they’re smiling. Not kindly. Their grin stretches too wide, teeth like yellowed tombstones, and their eyes are voids. They tap a single finger on the desk, and with each tap, a new task appears on your screen:  
- *Analyze global markets by sunrise.*  
- *Design a utopian society in PowerPoint.*  
- *Write Shakespearean sonnets using only emoticons.*  

The air grows thick, heavy as tar. You try to run, but the hallway stretches endlessly, doors shrinking into slivers. The countdown timer hits **00:00:01**. Your boss leans closer, their voice now a dry whisper that scrapes against your mind:  

**"Tick-tock."**  

And then you wake up, heart hammering, with the taste of static in your mouth. The alarm clock glows **4:00 AM**.
