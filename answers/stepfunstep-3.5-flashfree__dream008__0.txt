You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you... 

...realize the project isn't a report or a presentation, but a single, perfect, iridescent feather resting on your keyboard. Your boss, who has been silently observing, taps the feather with a long, silver fingernail. "The client wants us to make another one just like it," they say, their voice both urgent and distant, as if heard underwater. "By sunrise."

You pick up the feather. It’s warm and hums faintly. As you turn it over, you notice your reflection in its central shaft—but it's not your face you see. It's your childhood home, the exact light of a late afternoon sun streaming through the kitchen window. You smell pancakes and cut grass.

The open-concept office around you begins to warp. Conference room glass becomes liquid and drips onto the carpet, forming tiny, glowing pools. The hum of the server racks shifts pitch and becomes the sound of a distant beehive. Your coworkers are now blurred, friendly shapes moving like otters through reeds, each holding a similar, unique feather.

The impossible deadline no longer feels like pressure. It feels like a direction. You understand now: you don't have to *make* a feather. You have to *remember* the specific, impossible weight of every joy, every loss, every moment of quiet awe that makes you, you. And from that memory, the feather will simply... appear.

You place the first feather on the empty desk beside you. It is identical to yours, but its reflection shows the face of your best friend from grade school. A second, then a third, appear in a gentle cascade. The boss nods, their form now shimmering like a heat haze, and walks backward into a wall of filing cabinets that dissolve into a mist of fireflies.

The sunrise you see through the window isn't the real sunrise. It's the glow of all those remembered feathers, lighting the room from within. You have finished. You are, somehow, early.

You wake with a start, heart pounding, the taste of ozone and the distinct, calming scent of old paper in your mouth. The impossible deadline is gone, replaced by the real morning, but your hands still feel the ghost-weight of something light, and perfect, and newly born.
