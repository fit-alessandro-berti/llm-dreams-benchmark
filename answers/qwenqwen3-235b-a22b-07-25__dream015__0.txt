...Despite the hardships, you decide to plant a garden.

Not just any garden—something defiantly, beautifully out of place. You clear a patch of cracked asphalt near the crumbling overpass, using a rusted spoon to dig down until you hit stubborn earth. Your fingers bleed, the air tastes like metal, and the distant echo of scavenger drones hums on the horizon. But you press on.

From a salvaged military pouch, you pull a small, sealed packet of seeds. The label is faded, ink nearly gone, but you remember finding it beneath the rubble of an old school. "Sunflowers," it might say. Or maybe "Hope." You aren’t sure. It doesn’t matter.

You whisper to the seeds as you plant them—words from another life: lullabies, names of people long gone, promises you didn’t keep. You water them with the last drops from your canteen, then cover them gently with ash and dust, like tucking in a child.

Days pass. You nearly forget. Then—green. A crooked shoot piercing the gray. Then another. And another.

People begin to gather. Not to steal, not at first. They just *watch*. One brings a dented tin of rainwater. Another hums a tune while staring at the leaves. A child places a dead battery beside the sprouts, as if offering tribute.

Then the drones come. Low, circling like vultures. But something changes—they hover, confused. Their sensors flicker. Perhaps green is not in their threat database. Or perhaps they, too, remember what sunlight once meant.

And as the sunflowers rise—tall, tattered, golden against the smoke-thick sky—you realize you’re not rebuilding the world. You’re remembering it.

And in the dream, that’s enough.
