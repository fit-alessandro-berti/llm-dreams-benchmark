**The Dream Continues...**

As the wind howls through the trees, their leaves twist and shiver, casting eerie shadows on the forest floor. The sky darkens in an instant, as if someone had pulled a heavy curtain over the sun. Thunder rumbles in the distance, growing louder with each step you take.

The air grows thick with the scent of damp earth and ozone. Lightning flickers between the branches, illuminating the path ahead in jagged flashes. The trees seem to lean in closer, their gnarled roots writhing like serpents beneath your feet.

Then, the rain begins—not a gentle drizzle, but a torrential downpour that soaks you in seconds. The water runs in rivers along the forest floor, carrying leaves and twigs in its rush. You try to shield your face, but the wind whips the rain sideways, stinging your skin.

Through the storm, you notice something strange—a faint, golden light pulsing between the trees. It flickers like a dying candle, but it’s steady enough to guide you forward. You follow it, your clothes heavy with water, your breath ragged.

As you push through the last of the undergrowth, you find yourself standing at the edge of a clearing. The storm rages around you, but in the center of the glade, there’s a small, ancient stone well. The golden light comes from within it, glowing like liquid sunlight.

A voice—soft yet commanding—whispers from the well:

*"What do you seek?"*

The water inside swirls, revealing fleeting images: a door you’ve never opened, a face you’ve forgotten, a choice you’ve yet to make.

The storm still howls, but the well feels warm, inviting. Do you reach out? Do you speak? Or do you turn and run back into the storm?

**What happens next?**
