...find a way to survive. The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth. You're wearing rough-spun clothes, and the cobblestone street under your bare feet is cold and uneven. A man leading a cart drawn by a tired-looking horse clatters past, giving you a curious glance.

Your stomach clenches with a primal hunger. The first priority is food. You see a market square up ahead, bustling with people. The language they speak is unfamiliar, a melodic flow of sounds you can't decipher. You have no money, no tools, no knowledge of this place.

You spot a baker pulling fresh, dark-crusted loaves from a brick oven. The aroma is intoxicating. An idea sparks. You find a relatively clean patch of ground and sit. With a sharp stone, you begin to draw. Not words, but pictures. You sketch the sun, the moon, the stars—universal constants. Then you draw a simple sequence: a stick figure (you) pointing at an empty belly, then the same figure working—carrying water, stacking wood—and finally, receiving a loaf of bread from a baker.

You wait.

A woman with a kind, weathered face stops. She looks at your drawings, then at your desperate eyes. She says something you don't understand, but her tone is gentle. She points to a pile of heavy-looking crates near a merchant's stall, then to the drawing of you working.

A wave of relief washes over you. It's not going to be easy. This world is harsh and unforgiving. But you've just made your first connection. You've traded a picture for a possibility. You nod, get to your feet, and follow her. The dream isn't about finding your way back; it's about finding your place, here and now. And it's only just begun.
