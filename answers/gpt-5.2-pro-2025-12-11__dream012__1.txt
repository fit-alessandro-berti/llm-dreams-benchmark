…you feel the wheel vibrating under your palms like a living thing, as if the ship is trying to tell you which way it wants to go. The storm doesn’t just rage—it argues. Thunder rolls overhead in long, syllabled sentences, and each flash of lightning shows you a different version of the sea: black glass, boiling ink, a field of pale hands reaching up from below.

Your crew crowds the deck, slick with rain, eyes wide and shining like lanterns. No one speaks. They’re waiting for the kind of decision that becomes a story people repeat long after you’re gone.

You open your mouth to give an order, but your voice comes out as a ship’s bell. The sound rings across the waves—clear, commanding—and the men straighten as if a rope has been pulled through their spines.

“Hold her steady,” you try again, and the bell tolls once more.

The compass in its brass bowl begins to spin. Not in circles—upward, like a coin balanced on its edge. Its needle lifts and points directly into the sky.

The first mate crawls to you on hands and knees, fighting the wind. “Captain,” he shouts, but the wind steals half the word, leaving only *cap…* like a desperate breath. He holds up a map. It’s soaked through, ink running, but you can still make out the coastline.

Except the coastline is drawn like a mouth, and the bay is an open eye.

The ship lurches hard to port. Something massive moves beneath you. Not a wave—something with intention. The hull groans, and the sound is not wood but bone.

You look down between the planks and see water where there should be darkness, and in the water: stars.

A part of you remembers, with the casual certainty dreams have, that this is not an ocean at all. This is the space between thoughts. The storm is not weather—it’s fear, stirred up by the turning of something deep inside you.

“Captain!” the crew calls again, and this time the word comes out in your own voice, from your own mouth, in a way that feels suddenly fragile. Your hands tighten on the wheel.

You could fight the storm. You could order sails reefed, lines hauled, men lashed to railings. You could do everything a captain is supposed to do.

Or you could do the one thing no one expects.

You let go.

The wheel spins. The ship doesn’t capsize. Instead it stops, unnaturally still amid the chaos, as if the storm has run out of you to push against. The rain pauses in midair. Each drop hangs like a bead on invisible threads. Lightning freezes as a white tree branching across the sky.

In that absolute silence, you hear a voice from below deck—not shouted, not urgent, but calm, as if it has been waiting.

“Come down,” it says. “You can’t steer from up there.”

Your crew watches you, the way people watch someone step to the edge of a cliff. Their faces blur at the edges, as if they’re drawn in charcoal and the rain is smudging them away.

You walk to the hatch. The stairs descend farther than they should. Each step takes you deeper into the ship, and also into yourself, until the air changes—thicker, warmer, smelling faintly of salt and old paper.

At the bottom is a corridor you’ve never seen before, lined with doors on either side. Each door is painted with a scene: a childhood room, a city street at night, a hospital hallway, a kitchen table set for one more person than ever arrived.

You pass them, drawn toward the end where a single door stands unpainted. Bare wood. No handle.

You press your palm to it and feel a slow heartbeat through the grain.

The door opens inward without moving, as if you simply remember it open.

Inside is the ship’s hold—except it’s a library. Shelves rise into shadow, and books lie stacked like cargo. In the center, a figure sits at a desk made of driftwood, writing in a ledger with a pen that glows like the tip of a match.

The figure looks up. It is you, older by a handful of years and a handful of losses, eyes tired but steady. On the desk lies the compass, now perfectly still.

“You’ve been trying to outrun it,” the older-you says, and taps the ledger. The pages are filled with your handwriting—every worry you’ve tried to ignore rendered in neat lines, as if naming them could contain them.

Above the desk hangs a lantern. Its glass is cracked, but it burns anyway.

“What is the storm?” you ask, and your voice doesn’t echo. It sinks into the air like a stone into water.

The older-you turns the ledger around. There is a drawing on the page: your ship, tiny, and the storm towering above it. But the storm has a face—your face, eyes squeezed shut.

“It’s you,” the older-you says simply. “Not the part you show them. The part you keep locked in the hold.”

Up above, you can feel the ship again, creaking, straining. The crew is still there, waiting. You picture their hands on ropes, their trust like weight.

“I don’t have time,” you say. “They need me.”

“They need you awake,” the older-you replies. “Not just performing captaincy. Awake.”

He reaches out and sets the compass in your palm. The needle is warm.

“This doesn’t point north,” he says. “It points to what you’re avoiding.”

The needle turns, and you feel it tug—not toward the sky, not toward the sea, but toward one of the painted doors behind you. The one with the kitchen table. The extra place setting.

Your throat tightens with the strange, immediate grief dreams can summon without explanation. You know, without being told, who never sat there.

“What happens if I open it?” you whisper.

“You stop sailing in circles,” the older-you says. “Or you keep pretending you’re the only one holding the world together until the sea teaches you otherwise.”

The lantern above flickers. For the first time, the older-you’s expression softens.

“You can go back up,” he says. “You can give orders. You can look brave. But try this: tell them the truth. Even just a little.”

The compass needle continues to pull.

You turn, climbing the stairs that are too long, back toward the deck. The storm resumes as you rise—rain drops finishing their fall, thunder finishing its sentence. Wind slams into you.

You burst onto deck, and the crew surges toward you. The first mate grabs your arm, eyes frantic. “Captain! Orders!”

Your hands find the wheel again. It’s still vibrating, but now you can feel the rhythm inside it, a pulse you can match.

You look at their faces—soaked, frightened, faithful—and something inside you loosens.

“Listen,” you call, and your voice is your own. It wavers, then steadies. “I can’t promise I’ll outfight this storm. I can promise I won’t lie to you. We’re scared. I’m scared.”

The wind seems to hesitate, as if surprised.

“But we’re not lost,” you continue. “Not while we’re together. Reef the sails. Keep the bow into it. And—” You swallow. “And if I start pretending I’m fine, you remind me.”

The first mate’s eyes widen, and then he nods, hard. “Aye.”

The crew moves. Lines snap, canvas shrieks, hands work with a new kind of urgency—not just obedience, but companionship. As they act, the storm changes. It doesn’t vanish, but it becomes less personal, less like an attack and more like weather.

Lightning splits the sky, and in the flash you see it: ahead, between walls of rain, a channel of calmer water like a path opening.

The compass needle points straight toward it.

You turn the wheel.

The ship answers.

For a moment, you swear you hear laughter in the thunder—not mocking, but relieved. The sea still heaves, but the waves stop trying to throw you off your feet. They lift you instead, like a strong hand beneath your hull.

And as the ship slides into that narrow calm, the horizon does something impossible: it bends downward, as if the world is folding.

You realize with a slow, dizzy clarity that you are not sailing toward land.

You are sailing toward waking.

The crew’s faces begin to fade like mist. The ropes become threads of light. The wheel becomes the edge of a bedframe under your fingers. The roar of the storm thins into the hush of your own breath.

Just before everything dissolves, the first mate leans close enough that you can hear him over the last whisper of wind.

“Good captain,” he says, and his voice is suddenly your own again, from somewhere deep and kind. “Next time, don’t wait for the storm.”

Then the sea becomes darkness.

And you open your eyes, the feeling of the compass still warm in your palm, pointing quietly—persistently—toward whatever you’ve been avoiding, waiting for you to choose to steer.
