...to take the argument out of your mouth like a splinter and hold it up to the light.

It comes out whole, to your surprise, slick with heat and the taste of tin. In your palm it cools and hardens, a little red stone that hums faintly, as if it contains an engine or a bee. Your friend falls silent, watching. Their chest rises and falls with the same tight cadence as yours. The room you've been in—was it a kitchen, a car, a sidewalk under those orange lamps?—slides its walls back, gives you space. The ceiling is full of slow-wheeling swallows. Somewhere far off, plates clink, rain shushes, an elevator dings in an empty building.

You are dreaming, you remember. It lands in your body like stepping onto a boat and finding it steadier than you feared. You are dreaming, and there are different rules available.

You place the red stone on the table between you. It clicks against the wood and becomes a kettle. Steam starts to coil from the spout and nestle under the lights. Your friend opens their mouth, then closes it, palms splayed on the table as if to ground themselves. Their eyes are full of tiny weather: thunderheads gathering, sunlight trying the angles.

“What are we even doing?” you say, but the words come out as a handful of bright birds. They wheel up, circle, and settle in the rafters, watching with their heads cocked. Your friend’s answer is a spool of thread that rolls toward you and bumps your wrist, as if to say: pull carefully or you’ll knot it.

You decide to push the elevator button in the air labeled Understand. It doesn’t exist until you imagine it, but then it’s there—brass, smudged, realer than your shoes. When your thumb presses in, the floor slides down with a polite shudder. The kitchen or car or sidewalk peels away. For a moment you’re standing in their hallway, looking at a mirror where your reflection is wearing their face. You step forward and the mirror steps back, until there’s no separation at all and you are inside their body, their breath, their shoes that have rubbed a raw place on the heel.

It is different in here. The same argument tastes like pennies and thunderstorms. You can feel where their spine stiffens when you say that one word. You can see the memory that sits behind their position—a small, fluorescent-lit room; a door you didn’t open; a promise that fell like a fork and clanged and no one picked it up. You feel the weight they’ve been carrying on the same shoulder that always registers the first cold day of autumn. Your heart beats with their particular rhythm and you understand it in a way that doesn’t require the right sentence or winning. It is a chord you recognize by the way it hums in your bones.

Then you are back in your own skin, standing on your side of the table, the kettle whispering. Your friend blinks, as if they have come back from somewhere too. You think maybe they stepped into you as well, because the air between you has shifted a fraction of a degree, like a door that was stuck and is not now.

“I don’t want to lose you,” you say, and it’s just a sentence, not a bird, not a knife. You say the quiet part first. In the dream it’s easier, or maybe not easier, just possible. The birds in the rafters ruffle and settle. The thread spools a little, slackens.

“I don’t want to be lost in this, either,” they say. Their voice arrives without the armor it had on a moment ago. The thunder in their eyes breaks and there is rain, clean, ordinary, necessary. You are both smaller and more real.

The kettle stops just before a scream and instead gives a soft sigh, like relief. You pour the steam out in your heads and it becomes fog that curls around your ankles and then a shoreline. You and your friend are walking along wet sand now, your footprints filling in with silver water. The red stone is on your palm again, heavy and beginning to cool.

“We could throw it,” you say. “See if it skips.”

“It might sink,” they say, looking out at the dark glitter. Their hand finds your sleeve anyway, keeps time with your steps. “It might sink and still not be gone.”

“Then we’ll know where it is,” you say. “Then we can stop tripping over it in the kitchen.”

You crouch together. The tide arranges itself, receptive. You skim the red stone sidearm, imperfectly. It doesn’t skip so much as hop—one, two—and then plunk. Circles move outward and touch your ankles, your knees, the hem of your stubbornness. The birds come down to inspect, brave and unafraid. The thread catches the light and maps a path between your hands like a constellation you hadn’t noticed while you were busy being right.

You look at each other and, because this is a dream, you can both see the small selves inside—the first time you argued, the first time you learned to apologize sincerely, the time you were both so hungry and tired you mistook your bodies’ depletion for a moral wrong. You can see the versions of you who go on from here in a hundred directions: some who double down, some who walk away, some who make a joke and change the subject forever. They’re all valid and also not what you want. You reach for the one where you try again, slower, with your palms up.

“Can we take a day?” you ask. “Not to avoid it. To carry it carefully.”

“Yeah,” they say. “Let’s put it somewhere it won’t keep boiling.”

The ocean obliges, offering a shelf of smooth rock that wasn’t there a moment ago, labeled with a small brass plaque: Important But Not Urgent. You place the not-quite-stone there and it settles, a heartbeat felt more than heard. A bus pulls up where the sea should be, painted in friendly colors, ROUTE: BOTH glowing in soft letters. You don’t need to climb aboard. You just need to know it exists.

On the walk back, the sand melts into carpet, into tile, into the mat by your door. Your friend’s shoulders look lower. Your own shoulders feel included in your body again, instead of hovering a few inches above. The door opens to wherever you started, but the swallows have gone to bed and the room is warmer.

“Tomorrow,” you say.

“Tomorrow,” they echo, and it isn’t a delay so much as a promise to show up with water and tools instead of sparks.

When you wake, your tongue tastes a little of pennies and salt. Your pillow smells faintly of rain. There’s no red stone on your nightstand, of course. Only the impression of its weight in your palm, and this thought like a button you can still press in daylight: Understand. You reach for your phone, not to continue the fight, but to say, Hey. I had a dream we did this better. Can we try?
