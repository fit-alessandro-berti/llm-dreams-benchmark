…and a brush floated just beside it, still dripping with a shimmering, silver powder instead of paint. Intimacy, it hums, though it defies description. As soon as I touched the brush, ripples cascaded outwards from it, pushing the surrounding landscape into a vibrant eruption. Rolling turquoise dunes melted into stripes of burning amethyst, while pine trees warped into spirals of emerald and gold. I lifted the brush, surprised by its light, weightless texture, as though fashioned from starlight.  


The air itself pulsed with rhythmic shifts between impossible geometries—perfect hexagons blossoming and collapsing, spheres transforming into jagged rhombuses, and the very hills seemed to sigh with a slow, rotating pattern. Ahead, nestled beneath a colossal, pulsating square of ochre, was an ancient- looking door.  It appeared constructed of layered shadows, and as I approached, listening for an answer to whether I was welcome, a voice, soft as wind chimes made of sea shells, urged, "Your colors are muted.  Begin to bleed.” 


Fear, sharp and crystalline, gripped me, but an overwhelming, undeniable desire to *create* compelled me onward. I took my position before the blank canvas and started to paint not with hues I recognized, but feelings — longing for echoes of home, the ghost memory of laughter, the quiet persistence of hope—and each stroke, each brushstroke, wasn't just a form, but an unraveling of a hidden geometry only *I* saw.  

Outside, the world seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the colors born from my inner struggle to become reality... and as I painted, the shifting landscape started mirroring the frantic dance within me, and I realized this blank canvas was holding not just an expectation of beauty, but a prison of my own unexpressed emotions.
