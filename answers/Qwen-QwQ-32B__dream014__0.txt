The strangers approach with a quiet hum of camaraderie, their faces blurred at the edges, as if sketched in watercolor. The first, a figure in a coat stitched with constellations, offers a hand. "This way," they say, their voice like wind chimes. You follow, and the city’s chaos softens—neon signs dim to warm amber, skyscrapers tilt like leaning books, and the air smells of rain-soaked earth.  

They lead you through alleyways where walls shift like origami, unfolding to reveal hidden gardens. A second stranger, their skin shimmering like liquid mercury, points to a bridge arched over a river of starlight. "Cross here," they murmur. As you step onto the bridge, the strangers’ forms begin to dissolve, their laughter echoing as they fade into the mist.  

The river below reflects not your face, but a mosaic of faces—strangers, loved ones, versions of yourself you’ve never met. A figure emerges from the water, their body made of flickering shadows and light. "You’re never truly alone," they say, voice overlapping with the strangers’ echoes. "The city bends for those who let it."  

You reach the bridge’s end, where a door floats midair, etched with symbols that pulse like a heartbeat. Behind it, a faint melody plays—a mix of a lullaby and a subway’s distant rumble. The door swings open to a plaza where crowds gather, but instead of faces, everyone wears masks shaped like animals, flowers, and geometric flames. They’re all whispering your name.  

The dream lingers here, unresolved. Do you step through the door? Or turn back, now certain the city holds no final destination, only infinite paths? The answer dissolves as you wake, but the strangers’ hum remains in your ears—a melody you can’t place, yet feels like home.
