You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and each one seems to pull you into their orbit like gravitational anomalies in a crowded cosmos. First, there's a cluster of philosophers in tweed jackets, debating the ethics of butter on toast with such fervor that the air thickens with buttery steam. One of them, a man with a beard like a silver waterfall, turns to you and asks, "But if the toast lands butter-side down, does the universe conspire against joy?" You nod sagely, pretending to agree, and slip away, your heart pounding like a drum solo in a silent film.

Deeper into the throng, you stumble upon a troupe of acrobats who aren't performing—they're just folding origami cranes from cocktail napkins while reciting limericks about quantum physics. A woman with hair like spun copper invites you to join, her eyes twinkling with mischief. "Fold with us," she whispers, "and we'll teach you to fly without wings." Your fingers fumble the paper, and suddenly the crane in your hand flaps its wings, lifting you a few inches off the ground before dissolving into confetti that rains down like forgotten wishes. Laughter echoes, but it's not mocking—it's the sound of stars giggling at their own reflections.

The room warps now, the walls breathing in time with the jazz quartet in the corner, their instruments morphing from saxophones to serpents that coil and uncoil melodies. You push through a knot of chefs who are taste-testing emotions from silver spoons—spicy regret, sweet nostalgia, a dollop of salty what-ifs. One offers you a bite of pure curiosity, and it bursts on your tongue like fireworks, sending visions of alternate lives flashing before you: you as a pirate charting maps of the moon, you as a librarian whispering secrets to ghosts.

Finally, after weaving through a ballroom of dancers whose shadows lead the steps instead of following, you spot your one familiar face across the chandelier-lit expanse. They're laughing with a group of clockmakers who wind pocket watches with threads of moonlight. But as you approach, the floor tilts like a funhouse mirror, and your friend turns—not into a stranger, but into a version of yourself, younger, wilder, with eyes full of the questions you stopped asking long ago. "I've been waiting," they say, handing you a key made of smoke. "The party's just beginning. Unlock the door behind the bandstand—it's where the real dreams hide."

You twist the key, and the world folds inward like a paper lantern extinguishing itself. The gathering fades to whispers, and you wake with the taste of curiosity still lingering, wondering if the social was ever about finding anyone at all.
