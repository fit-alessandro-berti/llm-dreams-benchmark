find a source of fresh water. My throat is incredibly dry. I see cobblestone streets, and the air smells of woodsmoke and baking bread. It feels medieval, perhaps even older.

I stumble towards the center of the village, my modern clothes drawing stares from people in wool tunics and leather aprons. I spot a well in the town square and rush toward it, frantically pulling up the bucket.

Just as I raise the wooden ladle to my lips, a hand clamps down on my wrist. It belongs to an old man with a long grey beard and eyes that seem to know too much.

"You cannot drink from the Past," he whispers, his voice raspy. He points a trembling finger at the water. "Look closer."

I look down into the bucket. The water isn't clear. It is swirling with faint, ghostly images—shadows of knights riding horses, glimpses of torchlit processions, the echo of a plague doctor's mask floating beneath the surface.

"The water remembers everything," the old man says, releasing my wrist. "Drink it, and you drown in memories that are not yours. You will lose yourself to the history of this place."

He reaches into his cloak and hands me a small, empty vial made of dark glass. "There is a spring, high on the mountain, that runs backward. Its water forgets. If you fill this, you will have a drink that brings no burden. But you must hurry. The sun is setting, and the mountain is haunted by the things the water has already forgotten."

I take the vial, my thirst warring with the fear of the shadows in the well. I turn and run toward the looming silhouette of the mountain, hoping to find the spring before the ghosts find me.
