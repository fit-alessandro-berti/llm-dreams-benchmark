You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to wander the labyrinthine streets, neon signs flickering in a language you half-recognize but can't quite grasp, like whispers from a forgotten memory. The air hums with the buzz of hover-cars and distant chatter, and your heart races as a holographic map materializes in your palm—unbidden, glowing with ethereal blue light. It points to a towering spire in the city's heart, but the path twists through alleyways that shift like living shadows.

Panic surges, but then a street vendor, an old woman with eyes like polished obsidian, beckons you over. "The meeting? It's not a place, child—it's a convergence," she says, handing you a steaming cup of something iridescent. You sip, and suddenly the city warps: buildings fold into origami birds that take flight, carrying you upward. You land at the spire's summit just as the hour strikes, facing a council of dream-weavers who reveal that this "meeting" is your own subconscious unraveling a long-buried secret. As they speak, the ground beneath you dissolves into stardust, and you awaken with a jolt, the city's echoes lingering in your mind like a half-remembered promise.
