You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **grab them by the shoulders, pull them into a fierce embrace, and whisper, "Screw this—let's just run away to that island we always talked about, forget the fight, and live wild under the stars."**

Suddenly, the dream warps: the room melts into a sandy beach at twilight, waves crashing like applause. Your friend laughs, eyes sparkling, and you both dive into the ocean, the argument dissolving into bubbles. But then the water turns to ink, pulling you deeper... and you wake up tangled in sheets, heart racing, wondering if it was a premonition or just your subconscious craving adventure. What happens next in the dream? You tell me. 😴
