You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **plant a seed**.

Not in the cracked, dust-choked soil of the city ruins—but in the cracked *skull* of a long-dead war-machine, its ribs of corroded steel jutting like broken ribs beneath a rusted chassis. You’ve found three such skulls scattered across the skeletal skyline of Old Metro-7, each hollow, each waiting. In your pocket: a single, preserved seed—bright green, iridescent, impossibly fragile—salvaged from a sealed hydroponics bay deep beneath the old botanical archive.

The air hums with static and the distant shriek of scavenger-drifters. Your canteen is nearly dry. A patch of glowing mold pulses nearby—radioactive, but edible in emergencies, if you grind it fine.

Yet, you kneel. With a shard of tempered glass, you scrape a shallow bowl into the soft earth pooled inside the machine’s cranial cavity. You mix in ash for nutrients, a pinch of desiccated lichen for water retention. Then, gently, you bury the seed—not just *a* seed, but *the* seed. The last known viable specimen of *Triticum aestivum* var. *Novus*, “City Bloom,” a strain engineered to thrive in extreme alkalinity and low light.

As you pat the soil shut, a tremor rumbles through the ground—not seismic. *Mechanical*. Something heavy shifts in the lower vents below. Not drifters. Not yet.

But you rise, brush the dust from your palms, and smile—not hopeful, not naive—but *determined*. Because today, against every law of scarcity and entropy, you chose growth.

You chose the slow, stubborn, impossible belief that something new can rise from the ashes—starting with one seed in the shell of something old.

You walk toward the next ruin, not with a weapon drawn, but with your hand in your pocket, fingers brushing the second seed you keep hidden.  
*One for now. One for tomorrow.*
