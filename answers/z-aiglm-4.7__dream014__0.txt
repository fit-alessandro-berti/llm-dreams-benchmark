...feel a wave of relief wash over you, instantly melting the icy knot of anxiety in your chest. You nod gratefully and fall into step beside them.

As they lead you through the labyrinth of streets, the chaotic noise of the city softens. The blaring car horns and shouting voices fade away, replaced by a melodic, rhythmic hum that sounds like the ocean breathing against the shore. The neon signs overhead stop flickering and blur into soft streams of watercolor light—lavender, gold, and pale blue—painting the wet pavement in glowing reflections.

The strangers don't speak, but you understand them perfectly. They guide you through a narrow alleyway that suddenly opens up into a vast, suspended garden floating high above the skyline. There is no gravity here, only a gentle buoyancy. You look back at the towering skyscrapers, but they no longer look intimidating; they resemble ancient, friendly giants made of glass and starlight, watching over you.

One of the strangers turns to you and hands you a small, glowing lantern. They point toward a spiral staircase made of clouds ascending into a night sky swirling with galaxies. You take the lantern, feeling its warmth in your palm, and realize you aren't lost anymore. You are exactly where you need to be. With a light heart, you begin to climb.
