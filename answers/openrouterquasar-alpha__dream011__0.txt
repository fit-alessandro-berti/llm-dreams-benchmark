…written in a language you don’t recognize. Strange symbols swirl across the page, shifting and changing when you try to focus on them. Panic rises as you look around the room—your classmates seem unfazed, busily scribbling away, their papers filled with clear, understandable writing.  

Suddenly, the symbols begin to glow faintly, and as you blink, they start to reshape themselves into recognizable words. The questions now appear as familiar challenges you’ve mastered before, filling you with relief. Just as you pick up your pen to begin, the classroom walls melt away.  

You find yourself seated at the edge of a vast, sunlit meadow. The exam paper transforms into a blank canvas, inviting you to create, explore, and define your own path. A gentle voice whispers, “Your future is what you make it.”  

Smiling, you realize this dream was never about the exam, but about trusting yourself and embracing the unknown.
