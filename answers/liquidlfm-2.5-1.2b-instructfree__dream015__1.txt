You find yourself trudging through a desolate landscape, the air thick with the scent of dust and decay. The once-vibrant ruins of cities lie in ruin, overtaken by nature reclaiming what was once human. The sky is a hazy gray, heavy with the distant echo of chaotic clouds. As you move forward, you spot a faint glow in the distance—a flickering light that seems almost like hope.

You push aside a fallen branch and approach it carefully. The light grows brighter, illuminating a small community of survivors scattered among the remnants of the old world. People are hauling debris, scavenging for food, and checking for threats lurking in the shadows. Some have formed small groups, sharing what little they have, while others are wary, their eyes darting nervously.

You realize that this community is hiding something—maybe a safe zone, or perhaps a place where supplies are stored. You approach the group cautiously, trying to blend in. The leader, an older woman with a steady gaze, calls out your name. You nod, and for a moment, the tension in the air seems to linger.

You offer what little you have—perhaps a small boiled egg or a scrap of cloth—and in that quiet exchange, they take it. A small glimmer of gratitude lights up their face. From that moment on, you decide to help. You’ll share what you can, join the group, and try to find a way to rebuild. The journey won’t be easy, but the thought of staying in unity makes the darkness seem a little less heavy.

Maybe the lights will grow brighter, and with it, a new beginning.
