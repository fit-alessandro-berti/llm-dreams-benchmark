You take a breath and step forward. The office tightens into a doorway rather than a wall—the impossible deadline is a door that glows with a pale blue light. As you push, the room rearranges: your desk becomes a ship’s deck, the calendar a star map, and the ticking clock a distant drumbeat guiding you rather than scolding you.

Your boss waits, not with shouting or pressure, but with a calm nod that says, “Show me what you can do.” The tasks float up like tangible objects in the air, and you grab three that matter most—the MVP trifecta. You break them into three tiny sprints, each with a live demo you can show in a single sitting. A floating whiteboard materializes, colors swirling as you group work into clear, bite-size chunks. Your colleagues drift into view as allies rather than spectators, each with a tool or shortcut you didn’t know you had.

You negotiate scope with a few deft questions, prune away the fluff, and redefine success: not delivering everything, but delivering the right thing—on time, with quality, and ready for feedback for the next iteration. The clock seems to loosen its grip; progress becomes a rhythm you ride rather than a sprint you fear. The boss watches as the plan snaps into focus, the room brightens, and the impossible deadline begins to feel almost possible.

The dream culminates in a crisp outline and a confident nod from your boss. “Let’s do this,” they say, and the door brightens one last time before you wake, feeling oddly energized and ready to tackle the day.
