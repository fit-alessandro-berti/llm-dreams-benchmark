You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and each group you approach dissolves into laughter, their faces shifting into the features of the person you're seeking, only to revert to strangers when you blink. You feel increasingly lost, yet compelled to continue searching through the ever-changing crowd. Finally, you spot them across the room, but as you draw near, they turn and you see your own reflection. The room falls silent, and you wake with a start.
