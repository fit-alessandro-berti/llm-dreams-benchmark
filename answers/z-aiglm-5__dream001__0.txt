run, but your feet feel heavy and unresponsive, as if the sidewalk were made of thick, drying cement. The buildings around you stretch impossibly high, their geometric facades shifting subtly whenever you blink, the street signs displaying languages that look familiar yet remain indecipherable.

You pat your pockets frantically for your phone, but find only a single, heavy silver coin that seems to vibrate with heat in your palm. Desperate, you approach a figure standing at the corner—a tall, faceless silhouette wearing a coat made of dark, rippling smoke—and hold out the coin.

"The Mercury Building," you stammer, your voice sounding muffled, as if speaking underwater.

The figure doesn't speak, but simply points a gloved finger toward a structure in the distance that appears to be upside down, hovering just slightly above the pavement. You glance at your wrist to check the time, but your watch face has turned into a swirling kaleidoscope of colors. You realize with a jolt of panic that you are now holding a briefcase you don't remember carrying.

You take a step toward the floating building, and suddenly the ground beneath you gives way. You brace for a fall, but instead of dropping, you begin to ascend slowly, drifting upward through the canyon of skyscrapers like a balloon, watching the city grid shrink beneath you, realizing with a mix of terror and relief that you no longer need to know the address—you are simply going where the wind takes you.
