You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and each group seems to be engaged in a different activity: one is playing a game of charades, another is deep in philosophical debate, another is laughing uproariously at a joke you can't hear. You weave through the crowd, scanning faces, but the one you seek is never among them. The rooms shift and expand; doorways lead to new spaces that weren't there before—a library, a garden, a kitchen—each filled with more unfamiliar faces.

A sense of urgency grows. You ask a passing waiter if they've seen your friend, but the waiter only smiles and offers you a glass of champagne that bubbles with tiny stars. You drink it, and suddenly the music becomes louder, the lights brighter. The crowd parts, and for a moment you see a familiar silhouette across the dance floor. You push forward, but the floor tilts and the silhouette recedes, as if you're on a treadmill. The more you hurry, the further away they seem.

Frustrated, you turn a corner and find yourself in a quiet corridor lined with mirrors. In each mirror, you see yourself, but with subtle differences: older, younger, dressed differently, with expressions of joy or sorrow. At the end of the corridor stands the person you've been searching for. They smile and beckon. You run towards them, but as you reach out, your hand passes through empty air. They dissolve into a thousand butterflies that flutter around you and then disperse.

You wake up, heart pounding, the dream's elusive image already fading, leaving only a lingering sense of longing.
