…adapt quickly if you want to survive. The air feels different—brisk, unsullied by smoke or engines—and the world has the hushed stillness of a time before modern noise. Wooden carts creak down a dirt road nearby, pulled by oxen. A group of people in rough-woven clothes pass you, their eyes narrowed with suspicion as they glance at your strange appearance.

Your first thought is simple: **blend in.** If you stand out too much, you could invite questions—or worse. You tug at your unfamiliar clothes and realize you’ll need to find something more fitting for the time. The faint smell of bread baking drifts from a stone building just ahead. Inside, the rhythm of daily life is unfolding as though you’ve always been a part of it, though you’re an intruder in this past.

You realize you will need to:  

1. **Secure food and water.** Survival comes first, though with no money of this era, barter or labor may be your only options.  
2. **Learn the language, or at least the dialect.** Their mouths shape words you almost understand, but each sentence feels slightly skewed, as though you’re listening through a fog.  
3. **Earn trust.** People in this time seem weary of outsiders. You may need to find a skill—storytelling, healing knowledge from the future, or even craftsmanship—that makes you valuable.  
4. **Discover when you truly are.** What era is this? Ancient, medieval, or something else? The fashions and tools give hints, but you’ll need to piece together the puzzle.  

A small child tugs at your sleeve, eyes wide, and whispers something hurriedly, then darts away toward the woods. The villagers glance after them, murmuring darkly. There’s something they expect you to do, though you don’t know what yet.  

Will you follow the child into the forest, risking the unknown, or stay in the village to cautiously learn their rules?  

Would you like me to continue the dream *narratively* as a story, where you make choices along the way (like an interactive dream adventure), or more like a vivid written vision that unfolds without your input?
