…and each challenge is stranger than the last.

1. The Gauntlet of Glass Floors  
   You step onto a levitating spiral of clear platforms hanging in a violet sky. Under your feet swirl memories of your résumé—past projects, unfinished ideas, even the e-mails you never sent. To advance, you must identify which memories still serve you and which ones hold you back. Each time you name a helpful lesson aloud, the glass underfoot lights up golden and you can step forward. Each time you cling to a regret, a hairline crack appears. You learn to let go quickly, and the spiral carries you upward.

2. The Interview With Your Future Self  
   At the top of the spiral you find a door labeled “Conference Room B, Tomorrow.” Inside, your future self sits across a sleek metal table, wearing the company badge you long for. Future-You asks only two questions:  
   • “What problem will you refuse to solve because it isn’t worth solving?”  
   • “What joy will you protect even when the workload doubles?”  
   Your answers feel pulled from somewhere deeper than thought, and as soon as you speak them, your future self smiles, stands, and dissolves into mist—leaving behind the badge.

3. The Elevator of Other People’s Expectations  
   Badge in hand, you enter an antique brass elevator whose buttons are labeled with opinions: “Be more realistic,” “Dress the part,” “Stay in your lane,” “Network harder,” “Settle down.” The car won’t rise until you pry off every button that doesn’t belong to you. With each discarded expectation, the elevator shakes free of gravity. When the last irrelevant button clatters to the floor, the roof opens and you rocket upward into a night sky strewn with neon constellations shaped like open doors.

4. The Final Pitch—Delivered to Silence  
   You land in a vast amphitheater. Rows of seats are filled with silhouettes—faceless, perfectly still. This is the board of directors, the hiring team, your mentors, your relatives, and the anonymous masses of social media all at once. No one speaks. The only sound is your heartbeat echoing back through the empty space. You realize the pitch isn’t to them at all; it’s to yourself.  
   So you speak—not about why you deserve the job, but why the work deserves you. You tell the silhouettes how you’ll grow the role beyond its bullet points, how you’ll treat mistakes as prototypes, and how you’ll measure success in moments of genuine impact. As your words leave your mouth they turn into birds of paper—cover letters folded into flight. The silhouettes fade to starlight, and the birds burst into constellations.

5. The Door Without a Handle  
   A single door stands in the center of the stage. There is no knob, only a small plaque that reads: “Believe and Press Forward.” You inhale, touch the wood, and simply walk through as if it’s made of fog.

You wake up in your bed, heart still racing. On your nightstand sits an unfamiliar brass key and a sticky note in your own handwriting: “First round interview at 10:00 a.m. You’ve already practiced.”
