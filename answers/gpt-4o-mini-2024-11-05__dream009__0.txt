find a way to adapt to this unfamiliar time. The people around you seem to live without the conveniences you're used to, but their world is full of vibrant life, traditions, and customs. You observe the architecture, the clothing, the methods of transportation, and the way people communicate. 

You begin to understand that in this new era, survival depends on blending in and learning quickly. You find a local market where people trade goods and exchange knowledge. The scent of fresh bread, spices, and unrefined fabrics fills the air, and you strike up a conversation with a kind vendor. Through the exchange, you learn that you're in an age where literacy and knowledge are key to social mobility, but books and education are rare.

With this new information, you make your way to a nearby library — a stone building that looks more like a fortress than a place of learning. Inside, there are scrolls and manuscripts, each one holding the wisdom of the era. However, to gain access to these texts, you need to prove your worth, either through skill, barter, or an apprenticeship with a master of the craft.

Determined, you seek out someone who can teach you the ways of this world. The day turns into night, and you realize you have no way of returning to your former life. But something within you begins to stir — a sense of curiosity, of adventure, and the realization that perhaps this new world holds the keys to understanding not only the past but your future as well.

What do you do next?
