and you hesitantly accept, their warmth easing your anxiety. As you walk together, the city’s chaotic noise fades into a melody of distant laughter and hummed tunes. The strangers, now glowing faintly like lanterns in the dusk, lead you through alleys adorned with murals that shift and bloom like living memories.  

At a quiet courtyard, they gesture to a door framed by ivy. “This is where you decide,” one says softly. You step through—and find yourself not in a place, but a moment: childhood laughter, a forgotten ambition, a fragment of a song. The city dissolves, and you realize the strangers were fragments of yourself, piecing you back together.  

You wake, not with answers, but with a quiet certainty—the kind that lingers like the last note of a dream.
