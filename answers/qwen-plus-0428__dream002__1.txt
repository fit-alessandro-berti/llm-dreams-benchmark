You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and **the trees begin to whisper in a language you don't understand**. The air grows heavy, and the ground beneath your feet feels like it's shifting. 

A sudden gust of wind blows through the trees, and you hear the distant roar of thunder. The sky darkens, and the sun dips below the horizon, casting long shadows across the forest floor.  

As the storm approaches, you notice something strange: the animals are gone. Birds are silent, and the only sounds are the crackling of lightning and the occasional howl of a distant wolf. You feel a chill run down your spine, as if the forest itself is aware of your fear.  

Then, just as the storm hits, you see a figure standing at the edge of the forest—**a person with eyes like storm clouds and hair like the wind**. They look at you with a mixture of sorrow and understanding.  

"You’re not alone," they say, their voice echoing through the trees like a thousand whispers. "The forest remembers you. But it also knows what you’ve done."  

Before you can react, the storm collapses around you, and the world around you begins to dissolve into a sea of light and sound. You wake up, drenched in sweat, heart pounding, and the memory of the storm lingers in your mind—**a warning, a promise, and a glimpse of something far greater than you ever imagined.**
