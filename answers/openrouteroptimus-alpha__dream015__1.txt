…push forward, determined not only to survive but to find other survivors and perhaps build something new from the ashes. The wind carries the distant howl of something—whether human or beast, you cannot tell. You tighten your grip on the battered backpack slung over your shoulder and tread carefully over cracked asphalt, weaving between abandoned cars sprouting with curious weeds.

A rusted bicycle wheel creaks in the breeze. You pass a burned-out café, its walls covered in strange symbols drawn in chalk. Pausing, you scan your surroundings for movement—learned caution. That’s when you notice a thin plume of smoke rising behind a collapsed building to the east. Smoke could mean danger, but it could also mean hope.

Heart pounding, you decide to approach. Step by slow step, you navigate through debris and broken glass until a faint voice reaches your ears—a child’s laughter, impossibly rare in this grim world. You peek through a gap in the rubble and see a small group, huddled around a campfire, faces illuminated with both wariness and warmth.

You clear your throat, announcing your presence before you step into the open. The group jumps, watching you with suspicion, but you hold up your hands.

"I'm not here to hurt you," you say. "I just want to help. Maybe together, we can survive."

As the silence stretches, a woman nods slowly, and a little boy offers you a half-melted chocolate bar.

For the first time in a long while, you let yourself hope.
