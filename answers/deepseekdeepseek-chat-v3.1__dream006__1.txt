Of course. Here is a completion of that dream, capturing a common dream-anxiety before shifting into a more surreal, dreamlike state.

...you begin to speak, but no sound comes out. You clear your throat, tap the microphone, but it's not that the mic is broken—the words themselves have no volume, as if the air has been sucked from the room.

A wave of panic flushes through you, but the audience doesn't seem to notice. They keep smiling, nodding encouragingly. You look down at your notes, only to see the ink is swirling, the words rearranging themselves into a language you don't understand—something between symbols and nursery rhymes.

You look back up, desperate, and that's when you notice the details. Your childhood friend is sitting in the front row, wearing a graduation cap. Your third-grade teacher is nodding sagely next to a giant, floating, translucent cat. The walls of the auditorium are no longer solid; they are made of shifting, breathing velvet, and the exit signs are blinking in a slow, hypnotic rhythm.

You take a deep breath, deciding to just push through and wing it. You open your mouth again, and this time, a perfect, resonant voice emerges—but it's not your own. It's the voice of a celebrated orator, deep and confident, telling a story you've never heard about a ship sailing on a sea of stars.

As the borrowed voice speaks, you feel yourself relax. You look at your hands and see you're not holding your notes anymore, but the reins of a wild, gently snorting horse made of shadow and starlight, standing right there on the stage. The audience is enthralled, and for a moment, you feel a profound and inexplicable sense of peace. You are not afraid. You are exactly where you are meant to be.

And then you wake up.
