…and you realize, with a strange, sudden clarity, that everyone is already moving in rhythm with your heartbeat.

“Hands to the lines!” you shout, but your voice sounds different in the storm—richer, echoing, like the sea itself is listening.

The waves rear up like dark mountains, the ship climbing and dropping with stomach‑turning lurches. Lightning claws at the sky, briefly sketching every worried face around you in stark white. You see fear there, yes, but also trust—raw, unfiltered trust.

You grab the wheel. It’s slick with rain and sea spray, but it’s warm, as though someone has just let go of it. You know, with the near-certainty that only comes in dreams, that if you turn left you’ll be swallowed by the storm… and if you turn right, you’ll find something else. Not safety, exactly, but *meaning*.

You turn right.

The ship groans, protesting, timbers shuddering as it cuts across the waves at a sharp angle. A roar rises—not from the storm, but from your crew—as they spring into motion: tightening ropes, adjusting sails, bracing cargo. They’ve decided: if you’re not afraid, neither are they.

But you *are* afraid.

You just happen to be more stubborn than your fear.

A massive wave looms ahead, taller than the mast. For a moment, the whole world is just that wall of water, glistening like glass, lit from within by flickers of lightning. You feel your thoughts narrow to a single point.

“Hold fast!” you shout.

The ship climbs the face of the wave, as if dragged upward by invisible hands. Time stretches thin. You can feel every droplet of rain on your skin, every vibration through the deck, the rapid thudding of your heart like a drum summoning something ancient.

At the crest, there is silence.

Then the world flips.

The ship hurtles down the other side, plunging into a valley of black sea. The impact sends everyone staggering, but miraculously, nothing breaks. A wild, shell-shocked laugh escapes someone near the bow. Another wave crashes over the rails, drenching everyone, but you’re still upright, still clinging to the wheel.

And then you notice it.

Beyond the chaos, far ahead, the horizon is wrong.

There’s a thin line of light—soft, not sharp like lightning. It pulses faintly, as though breathing. It’s not dawn; you *know* it’s not dawn. The storm is still raging around you, but that band of light is steady, patient. Waiting.

“We head for that glow!” you say, pointing.

One of your officers, hat soaked and hair plastered to their forehead, squints into the distance. “What is it, Captain?”

You consider answering truthfully: *I have no idea.* Instead, you say, “Our way through.”

And somehow that’s enough.

Wave by wave, you wrestle the ship toward the distant light. The storm doesn’t vanish, but it begins to feel… different. Less like a punishment, more like a test. Like it’s measuring you, weighing your resolve against its fury.

You feel the fear again, rising like the tide, whispering: *What if you’re wrong? What if you lead them all into worse?*

But another thought arrives, quieter, stronger: *What if I’m right?*

You breathe deeply, filling your lungs with salt and wind, and let your knuckles relax on the wheel. You start calling out not just orders, but encouragement—short, sharp lines that cut through the wind.

“Good work on that sail, hold it steady!”

“Brace there—yes, just like that!”

“We’ve made it this far; we’re not stopping now!”

It’s strange—every time you speak, the storm seems to hesitate, just a fraction of a second, as though listening. The realization comes slowly: this isn’t just any storm. It feels like a physical shape of every doubt you’ve ever had crashing down at once.

The glow on the horizon brightens.

You pass through one final wall of rain so dense it’s like sailing through a waterfall. You can’t see anything, can’t hear anything but the drum of water all around you.

And then, suddenly, you break through.

The storm is behind you like a towering ring of cloud, circling a wide, impossible calm. The sea here is smooth as glass, reflecting a sky full of stars you’re sure don’t exist in waking life—too many, too bright, too close. At the center of this calm, the light you saw from afar hovers just above the water, a gentle sphere that hums with a sound more felt than heard.

Your crew stands in stunned silence.

“What is that?” someone whispers.

You know—and you don’t know. It feels familiar, like remembering a name you haven’t learned yet. As captain, you step forward to the bow, the ship gliding closer to the hovering light.

It shifts as you approach, reflecting not your face, but moments: you clutching the wheel in the storm, your crew choosing to trust you, the exact instant you turned right instead of left. Every scene you see in its surface is a decision you made when you were afraid and moved anyway.

You suddenly understand.

The storm was never trying to sink you.

It was waiting to see if you would take the wheel.

The light pulses once more and drifts toward you. You reach out a hand—not quite touching—and warmth floods your chest. The weight you’ve been carrying, the silent fear of not being enough, loosens like a knot untied.

Behind you, a crew member calls, softly, “Captain…?”

You turn back to them, and this time, when you smile, it feels real and easy.

“We’re through,” you say. “You did well. All of you.”

The calm sea, the strange stars, the hovering light—they all begin to blur at the edges, like ink in water. The ship, the crew, the storm, even the wheel under your hands, all gently dissolve.

As you wake, somewhere far from any ocean, you can still feel the phantom pressure of the ship’s wheel in your grip… and the quiet, steady certainty that when things get rough, you *can* choose to turn toward the light, even if you’re afraid.

After all—you’ve already steered a ship through a storm.
