…run, though you’re not sure in which direction.

The streets around you are too wide, like someone copied a normal city and stretched it in all directions. Buildings lean in slightly, arguing with gravity but not quite rebelling. Signs hang from every wall, every lamppost, every parked bus—each one crammed with your name, the words “Important Meeting,” and a time that keeps flickering like a bad connection. 10:00. 9:43. 3:17. **NOW.**

You pick a street at random and hurry down it. Your footsteps sound wrong, like you’re walking on the underside of a drum. People flow around you, but when you try to stop one and ask for directions, their faces blur, eyes smearing into noses, mouths melting into cheeks. They mutter something that might be language, or just wind whistling through empty rooms.

A bus squeals to a halt beside you. Its destination sign reads:

> **MEETING – ALL STOPS**

You hop on. Inside, the bus is longer than it looked from the outside. Row after row of seats extends into a soft gray distance, disappearing into fog. Each seat is occupied by… you. Slightly different versions of you—older, younger, wearing clothes you recognize from years ago or never owned at all. Some stare out the window, some tap on invisible phones, some sleep with their mouths slightly open.

You move down the aisle, brushing past your own shoulder, your own knee. No one looks at you, except one version sitting near the middle, dressed exactly as you are now. They—*you*—raise an eyebrow.

“You’re late,” they say.

“For what?” you ask.

“For this,” they answer, gesturing vaguely at everything.

Before you can ask anything else, the bus lurches and all the lights go out. When they flicker back on, the bus is empty. No driver, no passengers, no copies of you. The seats are gone. You’re standing in an elevator instead, the walls paneled in mirrors that don’t quite reflect correctly.

The elevator panel is crowded with buttons, but instead of numbers, each button is labeled with a feeling:

* Mild Dread
* Quiet Confidence
* Panic
* Pretend Everything’s Fine
* That Weird Feeling When You Forget Why You Walked Into a Room

At the top, glowing faintly, is one more button: **Important Meeting.**

You jab at it. The doors close without a sound.

The elevator begins to move—not up, not down, just *away*. Your reflection in the mirror starts to lag, moving half a second behind you. When you raise your hand to touch the glass, your reflection doesn’t follow. It just stares at you, a little disappointed.

“You should really know where you’re going,” it says, but its lips don’t move.

The elevator dings. The doors open.

You step out into a library that must be the size of the entire city. Shelves stretch up into darkness, disappearing into a ceiling you can’t see. The air smells like dust and something sweet you can’t quite place.

At the center is a giant circular desk. Behind it sits a librarian with a clock for a face. The hands tick loudly, moving erratically, skipping minutes, jumping back, looping forward again.

You walk up. “I have a meeting in an hour,” you say. “I don’t know where it is.”

The clock-librarian tilts their head. The minute hand shivers.

“Of course you don’t,” they say, voice echoing from somewhere behind you. “You haven’t checked out the appointment yet.”

They slide a heavy book toward you. The leather cover has your name embossed on it. The pages inside are full of calendars, schedules, reminders, notes scribbled in your handwriting, crossed-out plans, and circles around dates that seem important but you can’t remember why.

Every time you try to focus on a page, the words swim away, rearranging themselves into unrelated facts: grocery lists, passwords you almost recognize, names of people you miss but haven’t thought about in years.

You finally find today’s date. There it is: **Important Meeting** at… the time is smeared, like someone dragged their thumb through wet ink. The location line reads only: **Where You Were Going Anyway.**

“That’s not helpful,” you say.

The librarian shrugs, their clock-hands spinning. “It’s where you’ll arrive, whether or not you know the address.”

You glance around. “Is there a map?”

“No map. Only exits.”

They gesture, and suddenly there are dozens of doors lining the library walls, each one labeled:

* The Place You Think You’re Supposed to Be
* The Place You Said You’d Never Go Back To
* Somewhere You Forgot On Purpose
* The Meeting
* Not That One

You walk toward “The Meeting.” The closer you get, the more you realize every door now says “The Meeting.” Even the floor tiles. Even the sky that’s somehow above you now. Every surface whispers it.

You pick a door at random and push it open.

You’re back on the street. Same city, same sense of unfamiliarity. But now, far ahead, you see a building glowing faintly gold, like it’s being remembered by someone. You know, with the strange, absolute certainty dreams like to give you, that the meeting is there.

You start walking—and the more you walk, the farther away the building seems. The streets loop, folding into spirals, then into tight circles. You keep passing the same café with the same three people in the window, frozen in mid-laugh. A traffic light cycles through colors you don’t have names for.

You check your watch. You’re exactly one hour early. Then you look again. You’re ten minutes late. Then: “Time: ???”

You break into a run.

At some point—there’s no exact moment—you’re simply *inside* the building. No door, no transition. One step you’re on the sidewalk, the next you’re standing in a conference room.

The room is full of chairs, all facing a long table at the front. Each chair is occupied by a version of you at a different age, from childhood to a future you don’t recognize. They’re talking among themselves, a low murmur of half-familiar fears and excuses and jokes.

At the head of the table is an empty chair.

Everyone turns to look at you.

“Finally,” says the you closest to your current age. “We’ve been waiting for you to show up.”

You swallow. “What… meeting is this?”

They all smile the same crooked almost-smile.

“This,” they say in unison, “is the meeting you’ve been rushing toward since you woke up. The one you’ve been late for your entire life.”

You stare at the empty chair. It feels like stepping onto a stage you didn’t know you’d auditioned for. You pull it back, sit down, and as you do, the room lights dim. A projector hums to life behind you. On the screen, instead of slides, you see a live feed: you, standing in the city, turning in circles, searching for where you’re supposed to be.

One of the younger yous leans over and whispers, “Don’t worry. It always starts like this.”

“How does it end?” you whisper back.

They think about it.

“We don’t know,” they say. “You’re the one who’s dreaming it.”

And then everyone looks at you, waiting—for you to speak, for you to remember, for you to decide what this was all for—as the clock on the wall spins faster and faster, its hands blurring into a circle that looks, strangely, like an eye slowly opening.
