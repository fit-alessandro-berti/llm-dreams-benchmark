**Dream Complications**

**Character (preferably the one experiencing the dream):** *sighs* Ugh, did the dream even have to have a judge?! Okay, here goes...

**Judge:** Idiots! You think they'd just give it to you on a silver platter?! Meet me halfway—I have an interview theme performance! You're in.

**Dream Character:** *nervous laugh* Ex-uh-bbish?! Imagine interviewing for a dream job... while pirkeating to make it crazy?

**Judge:** *clouds form around an announcer head* For YOUR EYE... here! If you can acknowledge impending disaster...

**Dream Character:** *translate* :Odds. Can I go home now?

**Judge:** :Microphone waves up. :

**DREAM CLOSING CEREMONY**
***
 condolences... **MEET "Dream"**
Grand prize: A **dream job full of maximally adjusted goals**.
