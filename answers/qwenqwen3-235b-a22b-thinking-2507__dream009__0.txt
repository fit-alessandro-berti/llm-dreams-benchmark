You wake in a coarse woolen blanket on a straw-stuffed mattress, the air thick with the scent of woodsmoke, damp earth, and something animal—maybe sheep. No alarm, no streetlights, no hum of electricity. Just the crackle of a low hearth fire and the distant crow of a rooster. You’re in a single-room cottage with mud-plastered walls, a dirt floor, and a thatched roof dripping condensation onto a clay pot below. Through a tiny, wavy-glass window, you see thatched roofs, smoke curling into a crisp, pre-dawn sky, and fields stretching toward a forest. **This is 14th-century England. The Black Plague has just begun.**  

As you step outside, barefoot on the cold, muddy track, the weight of *wrongness* presses down. No phones. No roads. No concept of "germs." People whisper about God’s wrath, not bacteria. You realize you need to **gain trust before the village turns on you as a witch or a plague carrier.**  

You’re dressed in rough-spun linen, indistinguishable from the locals—but your hands give you away. Too clean. Too soft. A woman drawing water from the well freezes, her knuckles white on the bucket rope. "*Stranger*," she hisses, backing away. "*You’ve come from the cursed village near the river, haven’t you? Death walks with you.*"  

Your stomach knots. *Of course.* You’re an outsider in a time when outsiders meant disease. You remember a fragment of history: villagers burned the sick alive to "purify" the air. If you don’t act fast, they’ll lock you in a hovel to rot—or worse.  

Then you see it: *the blight*. A field of barley, stalks withered to blackened stubs. The same crop failing in the next village over… the village rumored to be "plagued." It’s not the *Black Death* ravaging them first—it’s famine. A fungal infection, mistaken for divine punishment.  

**You need to act before sunset.**  
1. **Prove your value**: You recall from a documentary that *baking soda* (potash scraped from fireplace ashes) mixed with water can treat crop blight. But revealing future knowledge? Dangerous. They’ll call it sorcery.  
2. **Find an ally**: An old woman grinding herbs ignores the whispers. Her eyes hold quiet wisdom. You approach, miming sickness in the fields, then pointing to the ashes in her hearth. She squints… then nods slowly. *"The Widow Hettie understands signs,"* she mutters. She knows *herbs*, not science—but she’s desperate.  
3. **Risk everything**: Together, you mix potash with rainwater, painting it onto the blighted stalks. The villagers gather, torches flaring, led by the blacksmith shouting "*She poisons God’s earth!*" You stand between them and the field, shouting the only truth they might believe: *"This is God’s *remedy*! Ashes from His hearth heal His land—or watch your children starve by winter!"*  

Dawn breaks as the first green shoots push through the blackened stalks where you treated them. The blacksmith drops his hammer. Widow Hettie presses a bundle of feverfew into your hands—"*For when the real sickness comes*"—and points toward the forest. "*Go. Before the priest remembers his duty.*"  

You run, not toward home, but deeper into the era’s heart. Because now you know: **you don’t need to find a way back. You need to survive long enough to change *what comes next*.** The plague is coming. And history has no record of the stranger who taught a village to save itself with ashes.  

*(The dream lingers as you flee—the smell of wet ash, the weight of a herb bundle in your hand, and the chilling realization: some eras don’t just *happen*. They’re shaped by the ones who refuse to look away.)*  

---  
*Why this works for a dream:*  
- **Urgent stakes** (life/death, trust/suspicion) mirror real dream logic where threats feel visceral.  
- **Historical texture** (potash for blight, plague panic) grounds the surreal shift in tangible details.  
- **Twist on "need"**—not just survival, but *preventing* a future horror by acting *now*. Dreams love moral weight.  
- **Open-ended escape**—leaving room for the dream to continue (or haunt you).  

*What would *you* do next in the dream?* Hide in the forest? Find a monastery? Try to warn distant towns? The era’s ticking clock is your compass now. ⏳
