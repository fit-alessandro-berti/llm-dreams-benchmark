You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **gather firewood and start a fire to ward off the encroaching chill and sleep.** 

(And then, a detail starts to subtly overlay the dream, like a ghostly sheen, and the feeling shifts…):

**…a small, intricately carved wooden fox sitting on a moss-carpeted path, beckoning you forward.** 

The fox seems to wink, a single painted cherry on its nose. As you reach out a hand to gently stroke it, the air around you shifts – the rough stones of the forest floor soften, the smell of pine and damp earth intensifies, and a faint melody, like wind through reeds, begins to drift across the clearing.  

Suddenly, you catch a glimpse of a figure in the distance, cloaked in grey, moving silently through the trees. They're carrying a bundle and don’t look back once. 

What do you do?
