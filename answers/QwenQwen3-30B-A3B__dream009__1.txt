You wake up in a world of cobbled streets and towering stone spires, the air thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth. The sun hangs low, casting an amber glow over a village square teeming with people in tunics and cloaks, their voices a cacophony of a language you only half-understand. A blacksmith’s hammer clangs in the distance, and a goat bleats as it trots past a cart piled with sacks of grain. No phones. No lights. Just the hum of a world that feels both ancient and alive.  

As you stumble to your feet, a figure in a tattered robe approaches, eyes sharp with suspicion. “Stranger,” they murmur, “you’ve no coin, no name, and the wrong boots for this land. What business do you have here?” You open your mouth to explain, but the words catch in your throat. The dream shifts—your thoughts feel heavier, as if the era itself is pressing against your mind.  

Then you remember: *The artifact*. A glint of silver in your pocket—a small, ornate key, its teeth worn smooth by time. The robe-clad figure’s expression shifts to something like fear. “The Key of Elaris,” they whisper. “It’s not meant to be here. You’ve been chosen, or cursed. Either way, you’ll need to find the Tower of Echoes before the moon turns red.”  

The village square dissolves into a blur of shadows and whispers. You realize, with a jolt, that this isn’t just a dream—it’s a test. The key is a map, the tower a riddle, and the red moon… something you’ve seen in fragments of your own memories. But why *you*? And what happens if you fail?  

The ground trembles. A distant horn sounds. Your journey begins.
