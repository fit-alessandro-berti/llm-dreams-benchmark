find a way to blend in. The air smells different—wood smoke and something sweet, perhaps beeswax. Your clothes have changed: rough linen, laces at the throat, heavy boots. A bell sounds from the center of the small village you now stand in, and people begin to gather.

You follow them, keeping quiet. In the town square, a woman sells bread from a basket. You quickly realize your pocket is empty—no money, no phone. A young boy tugs your sleeve, offering a chunk of dark bread in exchange for your help fetching water.

You agree, hoisting a wooden bucket and following the boy down a dirt lane to the river. As you walk, he chatters about the upcoming festival. Listening carefully, you piece together clues: it's the early 1700s, perhaps in rural France.

As you kneel to fill the bucket, you glimpse your reflection in the water—a stranger's face, but your eyes staring back. For now, you decide, you must learn the customs, the language, the daily rhythms of this place. You resolve to find shelter, earn your keep, and perhaps—one day—discover why you woke up here, or how to return.

But for now, the bread is warm, the river clear, and you have a bucket to carry and a new life to live.
