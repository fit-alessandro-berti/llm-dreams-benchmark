…open your mouth to explain, but the words fall out like paperclips, clattering across your desk and skittering under your keyboard. Your boss nods solemnly as if this is exactly the response they expected, checks their watch, which is actually a tiny aquarium where a single goldfish is doing laps, and says, “Great. Just circle back by yesterday.”

You glance at your screen. The cursor is running ahead of you, typing your name over and over, stretching it until it becomes a rope. The rope hums, turns into a deadline, then into an actual line—red, pulsing—snaking out of your monitor, around your wrists, then very gently guiding you toward the conference room.

The hallway keeps lengthening by one step each time you take two. The carpet is wet grass. The fluorescent lights flutter into moths and settle on your shoulders like epaulettes, making you a general in the army of late tasks. You pass your coworkers; each wears a different clock as a hat. Some are digital and smirking, some are grandfatherly and too heavy to hold up. Everyone smiles that trapped smile of elevator mirrors. “You’ve got this,” they say in chorus, though their mouths don’t move. The chorus is coming from the vents.

In the conference room, the project is not documents or slides but a living thing curled up on the table, breathing softly under a tarp. Your boss gestures with the aquarium-watch, which now contains two goldfish, plus a tiny lighthouse that blinks your name. “Just start,” they insist kindly, like a dentist with a bouquet of drills.

You lift the tarp. Beneath it: a small city made of sticky notes and binder clips, streets paved with spreadsheets, tiny people queuing to enter cells labeled with formulas you’ve never seen. The sky is the ceiling, the ceiling is a calendar, and all the dates are today. A gust of air sweeps through—the air conditioning, or maybe the impatience of an entire quarter—and the sticky notes shiver and try not to peel.

“I don’t have the scope,” you say, or try to; this time the words are soap bubbles. They float up and pop against the calendar. Each pop becomes a notification: bing, bing, bing, like rain. The tiny city looks up at you expectantly. A miniature you waves from a rooftop and points to a cloud shaped like a question mark.

“First milestone,” says your boss, and slides you a pen that’s actually a key that’s actually a small sleeping bird. It opens one eye, then your hand, then the project. The pages reshape into a map. The map is a maze. The maze is your office. The exit is labeled Right Here if you knew where that was.

You decide to start anyway because that is the only magic you remember. You pick a thread from the red line and tug—and the wall opens like a zipper. Inside the wall are shelves upon shelves of neatly labeled moments you forgot you finished. Done. Done. Done. Some have dust. Some glow faintly. You pocket a glow. It warms your palm and hums like a yes.

The tiny city cheers. Your boss’ aquarium-watch overflows; the water spills in slow motion and becomes confetti. Time loosens its tie. The moths settle into the shape of a check mark. You sit, and as soon as you do, the chair grows roots into the carpet-grass and steadies you.

The keyboard is suddenly heavy and wonderful. You press one key and it prints a bridge. You press another and it draws a sun on the ceiling calendar that smudges every Today into Maybe Enough. The project leans toward you like a plant toward a window. You start.

Later—and also before—the goldfish in the watch whisper, “Look,” and the impossible deadline curls into your palm, smaller than a seed. You plant it in the Inbox. It sprouts into a window. Through it you see a beach where your coworkers are skipping stones that bounce on the water and turn into emails that politely decline being urgent. Your boss smiles with all their teeth and no edges. “Good work,” they say, voice echoing from the vents and your chest.

You blink, and the conference room door is now the office elevator, and the button for your floor reads Done. You press it. The doors open onto the same desk you started at, but the red line is a ribbon now, and someone is holding scissors—you, or your boss, or the fourth goldfish, which winks and says, “Whenever you’re ready.”

You inhale, and instead of paperclips or bubbles, your breath comes out as a breeze that flips the pages to the exact next step. You nod to no one and everyone. You begin again, and this time the beginning feels suspiciously like the finish line leaning down to meet you halfway.
