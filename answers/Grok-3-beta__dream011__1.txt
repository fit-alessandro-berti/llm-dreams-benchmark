completely unrelated to anything you've studied. The exam is filled with bizarre, nonsensical riddles and puzzles, like "What color is the sound of Thursday?" or "How many whispers does it take to build a cloud?" You're gripped by panic as you realize you have no idea how to answer these questions. The clock is ticking, and the room seems to grow smaller with every passing second. You glance around, hoping to find a clue or see if others are struggling too, but everyone else is scribbling away confidently, as if they understand perfectly.

Suddenly, the professor walks over to your desk, looming over you with an unsettling grin. Instead of offering help, they hand you a paintbrush and whisper, "Paint your answers." Confused, you look down and see that your exam paper has transformed into a blank canvas. The other students are now painting vivid, surreal images—melting clocks, floating fish, and landscapes that defy gravity. You dip the brush into a pot of ink that appears out of nowhere, but the ink keeps changing colors uncontrollably, splattering across the canvas in chaotic patterns.

Just as you're about to give up, a strange figure materializes beside you—a shadowy version of yourself. It leans in close and murmurs, "The answers aren't on the paper. They're in the cracks." You look around, puzzled, and notice tiny cracks forming in the walls of the room. As you peer into one, you see fleeting glimpses of memories, dreams, and forgotten moments from your life swirling inside. The pressure mounts as you realize you must somehow capture these fragments and weave them into your painting before time runs out.

The clock chimes, and the room begins to dissolve into a misty void. Your canvas is still incomplete, but the shadowy figure grabs your hand and pulls you toward one of the cracks in the wall. You hesitate, feeling the weight of failure, but the figure insists, "This is the real test." With no other choice, you step through the crack, and everything goes dark.

You wake up in a different place—a vast, endless library with towering shelves of books that seem to hum with secrets. The exam, the classroom, and the panic are gone, but a single book floats in front of you, its cover blank. As you reach out to open it, you feel a strange certainty that whatever is inside will determine not just your career, but who you are. Your hand trembles as you turn the first page...
