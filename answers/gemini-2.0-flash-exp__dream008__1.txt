Okay, the dream is starting. My eyes blink, and the fluorescent lights of my workplace hum above me, that familiar, irritating drone. My desk is a chaotic landscape of half-finished reports and overflowing sticky notes. It's a typical Tuesday, or so I think. Then, my boss, Mr. Henderson, appears. His face is a mask of unsettling calm. He’s holding a folder the size of a small suitcase, and a manicured smile plays on his lips.

“Ah, there you are,” he says, his voice almost too smooth. "Just the person I was looking for. We have a *small* project for you. Think of it as…a challenge."

He drops the folder onto my desk with a thud that makes my coffee jump in its mug. "It's due," he pauses, glancing at his wristwatch, "by…the end of the day. Today."

My heart hammers against my ribs. I flip open the folder. It's filled with diagrams, equations that make my eyes cross, and a dense narrative about…reversing the flow of time using sentient cheese. *Sentient cheese?* My jaw drops. This isn't just an impossible deadline, it's an impossible *task*.

Mr. Henderson is still there, watching me with that disturbing calm. He crosses his arms, a hint of impatience flickering in his eyes. "Well? What are you waiting for? Time is of the essence, my friend."

He's waiting for me to start. To even *attempt* this ridiculous undertaking. Panic starts to bubble up. This is absurd! My mind races, trying to find even a shred of logic in the situation. I need to buy time.

I clear my throat, my voice coming out a little shaky. "Mr. Henderson," I begin, "I understand the…importance of this project, but I need to make sure I have the proper resources." I gesture to the folder, "Do we have the necessary cheese cultures, the quantum entanglement generators, and...the sentience detectors?" My voice is laced with a hint of sarcastic hope that he’ll see the absurdity of it all.

Mr. Henderson just smiles wider. “The company provides for all eventualities, [My Name].” He gestures to the empty space next to my desk, and with a blink of my eye a towering machine appears. Its wires sparking, dials spinning and a small compartment with a label that reads "Cheddar" is clearly visible. "All the necessary resources you could possibly need."

My dream logic is clearly in overdrive. The panic intensifies. This is it, I'm going to have to try and figure out how to make sentient cheese time travel, in a single workday. My dream self takes a deep breath, the kind you take right before you have to do something completely ridiculous and impossible. I lean forward, my fingers hovering over the bizarre machine. 

Instead of arguing anymore, or falling into complete despair, I decide to embrace the absurdity. I look at the dial that's labeled "Temporal Anomaly Level" and a small voice in the back of my mind says, "Screw it! Let's see what happens."

With a grin that mirrors Mr Henderson's manic smile, I reach out...

**(And that's where my dream ends! I wonder if I managed to make the cheese time travel... maybe I'll find out in my next dream!)**
