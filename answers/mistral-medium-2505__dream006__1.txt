speak—but suddenly, your voice vanishes. You try to clear your throat, but no sound comes out. The audience shifts uncomfortably, murmuring among themselves. Panic rises in your chest as you realize you’ve forgotten every word of your speech. The notes in your hand blur into meaningless scribbles.

Just as the silence becomes unbearable, a single spotlight flickers above you, and the stage begins to tilt slightly, like a ship on rough waters. The crowd’s faces distort, their expressions twisting into something unrecognizable. A low hum fills the air, growing louder until it drowns out all thought.

Then, from the back of the room, a figure in a dark cloak steps forward, moving against the tide of the crowd. They raise a hand, and the hum stops. The stage steadies. Your voice returns—but when you speak, the words aren’t yours. They’re ancient, resonant, and the audience leans in, captivated.

You wake up just as the figure’s hood begins to fall away, their face still hidden in shadow.
