You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and glowing runes etched into its surface, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat. The air around it hums with an otherworldly energy, and your fingers tingle as you trace the symbols—they shift under your touch, rearranging into a riddle: "What binds the stars yet frees the soul?"

Puzzled, you whisper your guesses aloud. "Gravity? Love? Time?" With "time," the runes flare brilliantly, and the box clicks open with a sigh. Inside lies a shimmering orb, swirling with memories not your own: visions of forgotten cities, whispering winds carrying secrets, and a single, inescapable truth—you're not just dreaming this. The orb pulses once, and the box seals shut again, vanishing into mist as you awaken, the riddle echoing in your mind.
