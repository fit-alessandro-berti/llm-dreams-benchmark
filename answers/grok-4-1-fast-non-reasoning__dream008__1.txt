You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you freeze, hands hovering over the keyboard like it's a live wire. The clock on the wall ticks louder than a bomb, each second stretching into eternity. You type the first line of code—or is it a report?—but the screen glitches, words melting into gibberish, pixels bleeding red like an error message from hell.

Your boss leans in, face morphing into a grinning Cheshire cat, eyes bulging with impatience. "Now or never!" it hisses, breath hot and smelling of burnt coffee. You bolt from your chair, but the office warps: desks stretch into infinite corridors, coworkers sprout extra arms, typing symphonies of frantic keystrokes. You run, project files raining from the ceiling like confetti made of deadlines—2 hours, 30 minutes, 5 minutes—each one sticking to your skin, heavier than lead.

Heart pounding, you burst through a door into... your childhood bedroom? No, it's the boardroom now, filled with faceless executives chanting "Deliver! Deliver!" The project assembles itself on the table: a towering, pulsating machine of spreadsheets and algorithms, humming with impossible energy. You reach for it, but it explodes into butterflies—thousands of them, iridescent blue, swirling around you in a vortex.

Your boss reappears as a giant butterfly, wings flapping deadlines into dust. "You did it," it whispers, and the world dissolves into soft, endless sky. You wake up gasping, the alarm blaring—7:59 AM. Just a dream... or was it?
