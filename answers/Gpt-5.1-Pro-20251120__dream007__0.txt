…and you decide to say the thing you’ve been holding back.

“I don’t feel like you see me,” you blurt. The words land between you like a glass dropped on tile. Not shattering yet—just waiting to.

Your friend’s face twists. “That’s not fair.”

You’re in a kitchen that isn’t quite yours. The cabinets are the right color, but the handles are wrong. The light switches are in the wrong place. The clock on the wall ticks in slow, syrupy seconds. You both ignore how strange it is, because in the dream this argument has been going on forever.

“It *is* fair,” you insist. Your voice sounds too loud, echoing off the walls and then echoing again, as if the room has decided you deserve a chorus of your own anger.

Your friend clenches their fists on the table. “You always do this. You wait until it’s too late and then you explode.”

You open your mouth to fire back, but the microwave interrupts you.

Not with a beep.

With a clear, irritated voice: “Would you two like to review the evidence?”

You both look over. The microwave door swings open by itself, and inside is not a rotating plate, but a tiny theater. Rows of empty red seats face a silver screen that flickers to life.

You decide to play along. This is a dream, after all.

“Fine,” you say. “Show us.”

Your friend looks wary but nods.

The kitchen lights dim. You and your friend are suddenly sitting in the front row of the microwave theater, your real bodies still arguing, frozen at the table like mannequins. The screen brightens.

**Scene 1.**

You see yourself, months ago, saying “It’s fine” with a tight smile. You remember the day. You remember it *wasn’t* fine. On-screen you shrug, make a joke, swallow whatever you wanted to say.

Your friend on the screen laughs, oblivious. Your friend beside you shifts uncomfortably in their seat.

“I didn’t know,” they murmur.

“You didn’t ask,” you reply.

The microwave clears its throat—a harsh, static crackle. “Pause.”

The image freezes. A translucent label hovers over your dream-self: **UNSAID.** It lists things you didn’t say, floating like subtitles. *That hurt. I feel replaced. I wish you’d chosen me.*

You flinch. Your friend stares up at the words like they’re constellations.

“I didn’t see any of that,” they whisper. “All I saw was you laughing.”

“Yeah,” you say softly. “You weren’t supposed to see it. Back then.”

The microwave hums. “Next file.”

**Scene 2.**

This time you see your friend, alone. They’re pacing their bedroom, phone in hand, your chat open. They type something long, then delete it. Type again. Delete. Finally they send you just: *No worries :) next time!*

The label hovering over *them* reads: **AFRAID TO LOSE YOU.**

Under it, more unsaid things: *You matter more than you think. I’m scared to push back. I’m scared you’ll leave if I’m difficult.*

You glance sideways at your friend in the theater seat. Their jaw trembles in a way you’ve never seen.

“Why didn’t you tell me?” you ask.

They give a helpless laugh. “Why didn’t *you*?”

The microwave lets out a tired ding. “The court will now accept closing arguments,” it announces.

You stand up, even though your legs feel made of sand. The dream shifts; the microwavetheater stretches into a huge courtroom, but all the seats are empty except for hundreds of versions of you and your friend at different ages, watching silently. Kid-you, teenage-you, last-week you. They all look interested. None of them offer help.

You decide to be honest, for once, since apparently honesty is the only way out of this bizarre appliance-trial.

“I’m angry,” you say. Your voice trembles but doesn’t break. “Not just about what happened today, but about all the times I swallowed it. And I’m scared that if I tell you, you’ll think I’m too much. So I wait and wait until it spills out like this and… it feels out of control.”

Your words don’t echo this time. They sink into the room like ink into water.

Your friend gets up too. The versions of them in the seats lean forward.

“I’m not good with conflict,” they admit. “I grew up thinking that if someone was mad at you, they’d leave. So when you go quiet or say ‘it’s fine,’ I convince myself it is. Because if I poke at it and it’s *not* fine, then what? I’m terrified you’ll decide this friendship is too much work.”

The microwave jury murmurs appreciatively.

On the stand between you, a small object appears: the thing you’re actually fighting about. In the dream, it keeps changing shape. For a second it’s a forgotten promise. Then it’s an ignored message thread. Then it’s a calendar with your name crossed out, then a heavy stone labelled **PRIORITY.**

You both look at it.

“It matters to me,” you say quietly.

“I can see that now,” your friend replies. “And I didn’t treat it like it mattered. Or like *you* did.”

The room flickers. For a moment you’re back in the kitchen, mid-argument, both of you red-faced.

You realize you’re standing at a fork in the conversation.

In your left hand is what you *were* going to say—sharp, rehearsed, designed to win. In your right hand is something softer and much harder to pick up.

You decide to choose the harder thing.

You take a breath. Time slows; even the dust motes in the air pause to listen.

“Okay,” you say, voice quieter than before. “Let’s stop trying to win this.”

Your friend blinks, thrown off script. “Then what are we doing?”

“We’re… trying to understand it instead,” you say. “I’m not your enemy. I don’t want you to feel attacked. I just want you to understand why this hurts so much.”

The kitchen shifts again. The table between you shrinks, legs folding, becoming a small coffee table. Your chairs slide closer together until your knees almost touch.

“What hurts?” your friend asks. Their tone is different now—less defensive, more… curious. Vulnerable.

You feel the answer well up. Not the polished, angry one. The real one.

“It feels like I’m… optional,” you say. “Like I’m always the one who can be moved, rescheduled, cancelled. And when you did it this time, with this thing, it confirmed this story I keep telling myself—that I’m not really a priority to you.”

There. The glass hits the tile. This time it does shatter—except instead of shards, little glowing fragments spread over the floor, lighting the room.

Your friend stares at them. “I hate that you feel that way,” they say. “Because in my head, you’re the one person I assume will understand when I mess up. I lean on that too much. I tell myself, ‘You’re solid, you’ll forgive me.’ And that makes me careless. I’m sorry.”

The glowing pieces rise from the floor and rearrange themselves into a bridge between you, like stepping stones in the air.

“Can we fix this?” you ask.

“I want to,” they say, immediately. “Tell me what you need, even if it’s uncomfortable.”

You’re not used to saying that part either. But the dream seems built for uncomfortable truths.

“I need you to show up when you say you will,” you answer slowly. “And if you can’t, I need you to treat it like it matters. Not like it’s nothing. I need to feel chosen. Not assumed.”

Your friend nods, eyes bright. “Okay. And… I need you to tell me sooner when something’s wrong. Not at the breaking point. Even if you think I’ll be upset. I’d rather face that than this blow-up version.”

It’s not magic. Nothing suddenly becomes perfect. But the air feels lighter, like someone opened a window in a stuffy room.

The microwave dings one last time, satisfied. “Verdict: survivable,” it declares. “Sentence: intentional effort.”

The kitchen fades at the edges. Your friend’s face blurs, then sharpens, then blurs again. The argument, the theater, the glowing shards all swirl together, thinning into morning light.

As you start to wake up, a last thought drifts through your mind, gentle but insistent:

*You could actually say those things. Even when you’re not dreaming.*

You open your eyes with your heart pounding and the conversation still warm in your chest—fragile, possible, waiting.
