You start to wander the labyrinthine streets, where the buildings twist like forgotten thoughts, their facades shifting from gleaming chrome spires to crumbling ivy-choked ruins in the blink of an eye. Neon signs flicker in languages you half-remember from childhood—symbols that whisper promises of shortcuts, but lead only deeper into the maze. Your watch ticks louder than the hum of invisible traffic, each second a tiny heartbeat echoing off the walls.

Panic bubbles up, but so does that peculiar dream-logic calm, the kind that lets you fly if you just believe hard enough. You hail a cab that's more beetle than vehicle, its shell iridescent and alive, driven by a chauffeur with eyes like polished obsidian. "The meeting," you stammer, "wherever it is." He nods without speaking, and the cab dives—not drives—into a storm drain that opens onto a rooftop garden suspended in the clouds.

There, amid floating lanterns and trees that bear fruit shaped like hourglasses, you spot the conference room: a glass bubble perched on the edge of infinity, filled with suited figures debating the migration patterns of shooting stars. You're late by exactly three dream-minutes, but as you step inside, the room applauds. The agenda? Redefining gravity. Your contribution? A wild idea about using lost socks as anchors for the soul.

You wake up mid-sentence, the city's echo still buzzing in your ears, wondering if the meeting adjourned without you—or if it's still waiting, just a nap away. What happens next in your version?
