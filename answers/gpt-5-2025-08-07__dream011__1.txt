...not printed so much as growing. A neat paragraph at the top unfurls like a fern under your gaze, letters fern-fronding, and when you blink they curl back into spores. The paper smells faintly of rain. You look around. Everyone else has already begun; pens scratch with the confidence of mice building nests. A proctor with a tie patterned like a multiplication table coughs a chalk cloud into his elbow. The clock at the front of the room is soft at the edges, its minute hand a droplet that takes a long time to fall.

The first question stabilizes long enough to be read: Show your work. Define “work” without using time, money, or weight.

You grip your pencil. It is heavier than a pencil should be, warm like it has been held by every version of you. You attempt a definition. Your handwriting arrives before your thoughts and makes a sound like rolling pebbles. The word you put down is not a word you know; it looks like your grandmother's laugh written sideways. The letters tilt, consider themselves, shake their heads, and reorder.

Question two turns the page slightly toward you as if gossiping. Solve for x when x is the ache in your chest at the sound of closing doors. Assume the doors are familiar.

You glance at the proctor. He is watching the window, which is full of swimming fish. You are certain there wasn't a fish tank there when you sat down. A silver one knocks quietly on the glass with its mouth like it wants in. On your left the girl with the braid is tearing out pages steadily, feeding them to the wastebasket behind her which opens like a mouth and chews with care. Someone coughs and a small flock of question marks flies out and settles on the fluorescent light, peering down, cross beaks sharp.

The third question has no words. It is a smudge, the exact shape of your father's footprint on a wet porch. There is a line beneath it labeled Show your reasoning. Your hand hovers. It feels like lying to write numbers here. You draw instead. You draw a porch, and a shoe left out in the rain. You draw the place where the wood splintered and you promised to sweep and didn't. When you lift your pencil the lines sink slightly, as if you have drawn on a lake.

The overhead lights flicker. Between flickers the room rearranges itself. Your desk becomes narrower, then wider, then it is a boat. Your knees bump the side and you hear water somewhere underneath, patient as a throat clearing. There is a question you don’t remember turning a page for.

Question Seven (there was no four, the paper skipped it and put stairs where the number should have been): List all the things you would ask forgiveness for if forgiveness was a person you could call. Provide area codes.

Your stomach lurches softly, like an elevator learning. You put down as much as you can. You put down the year you grew quiet to fit the room. You put down the blue marble you found at seven and did not return. You put down the time you said “maybe later” and later never came. You put down the way you keep postponing your own voice. Your area code droops; you add another; forgiveness has moved.

Someone in the back raises a hand and the proctor walks over as though pulled by string. He bends his fishbowl head close. Inside his head there is a weather pattern. He points at the student's paper and the weather turns. You look back to your own and the questions have become multiple choice, but the choices are birds. Option A hops, Option B grooms its wing, Option C makes eye contact and you feel a decisive little shock in your ribs, a yes you can't explain. Option D is asleep.

Circle the answer you are willing to carry for ten years without applause, says the instructions. You extend your pencil, but the birds are warm and feathered and difficult to circle, and you can’t tell if they will let you.

You think, irrelevantly, of how the carpet smells like erasers. You think, irrelevantly, of the time you held your breath under bathwater and counted to twenty, then thirty, then came up because you wanted to keep wanting. Your thoughts are like that here, surfacing, bright like koi, then sliding back under. The exam rustles with other people’s certainty.

The clock drops a minute. It splashes. Time spreads in concentric rings across the room and glugs at the baseboards.

Question Nine: Prove continuity. Use examples of your choosing.

You write: the way the light itches the same patch of your bedroom wall each morning, summer and winter, even if it finds a different color there. You write: the friend you haven’t seen since you both wore cheap lip balm still knows the pitch of your pre-laugh. You write: the way a habit is a path, and a path is a habit, and both insist in the rain. Your pencil keeps going. It becomes a small animal running through you, tender, fast.

You're sweating now, but it is a kind of relieved sweat, like after jumping into cold lake water. Question Ten peers up at you. Design a bridge between what you promised and what you can stand. Materials limited to the present tense.

The present tense is a small pile of items on the upper right corner of your desk: the breath you are holding; the way your ankles rest against each other; the light on the fish's scales; this pencil. You sketch a bridge you know you can build: a plank of mornings; a rope of saying “no” kindly; a twine of that ache from Question Two, braided until it holds. You build it halfway across the whiteness. It's not far enough. You tear a strip from the margin, the place where the fine print lives, and you tie it to the end. The bridge sags then steadies. You test it by writing your name. Your name fits the span and stays.

Another minute falls and shatters into ten seconds crawling across the floor like eyelash spiders. Around you, all at once, pens go down. Heads tilt, necks crack, a collective exhale. The proctor says Time. His voice is a shore. You look down. You are on Question One again. The words are behaving now. Define “work.” They wait.

You erase what you wrote. The eraser makes snow, soft and squeaky. You think of the blue marble and of forgiveness with moving area codes, of bridges that are also verbs. You put the pencil down and place both hands on the paper, as if the page were a cat that wants warmth. You close your eyes. You reverse the path of the minute you lost and feel it return like a coin pressed into your palm secretly. You write: Work is anything you would still do if it left no footprint. Work is showing up anyway. Work is building a bridge out of mornings. Work is carrying the bird you choose for as long as it takes for it to trust your wrist.

You sign your name. The ink is not ink; it is a pulse. The letters look more like you than usual. When you stand, your desk-boat rocks and then steadies. The fish at the window opens its mouth again, but the knock you hear is the proctor's stamp meeting paper: a lighthouse, small, clean.

You walk down the aisle to hand in your test. On either side, others fold theirs into airplanes and send them toward the open door. Some put theirs under their tongues and swallow. You hand yours over. The proctor looks at it and then at you and then at something behind you that makes his tie turn into a river. You turn too. At the back of the room a door has appeared where the blackboard always was. Through it you can see a hallway of weather, a series of rooms you have not been in yet. A calendar with no dates. A chair with a coat thrown over it that you know is yours.

“Results will be posted,” says the proctor, but you realize you don't care where. The grade is already in your mouth, on your wrists, in your ankles. It says continue. It says begin.

You step toward the door, and as you do, the paper under your hand warms, as if purring, as if some part of you is pleased with what you chose. Somewhere distant an alarm begins, soft as a bird first learning morning, and for a moment you can’t tell if it’s inside the room or outside your life. Then the sound finds you, and the door swings open, and everything you don't yet know is bright.
