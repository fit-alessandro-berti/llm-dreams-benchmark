You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the sky darkens in a way that seems to pulse with a low, throbbing hum—like the forest itself is taking a deep breath.

The canopy, once a dappled quilt of green, turns an inky violet, and the leaves begin to shimmer, each one catching a faint, electric glow. A wind, soft at first, gathers strength, coaxing the branches into a slow, deliberate sway. The scent of pine morphs into something sweeter, like wild honey and distant rain-soaked earth.

As the first drops fall, they don’t hit the ground; instead, they linger in the air, suspended like tiny glass beads, refracting the dim light into ribbons of color. Each bead hums a note—some high and tinkling, others low and resonant—forming a chorus that seems to answer the storm’s own rhythm.

You reach out instinctively, and one bead rolls onto your palm. It’s warm, pulsing with an inner light that matches the beat of your own heart. When you clench your fist, the bead bursts, releasing a cascade of luminous droplets that explode into a spray of luminescent fireflies. They swirl around you, their wings flickering like miniature lanterns, illuminating the forest floor with a soft, amber glow.

The storm intensifies, but rather than feeling threatening, it feels like an invitation. The thunder rolls not as a roar, but as a deep, resonant drumbeat that vibrates through your bones. Lightning forks across the sky, but instead of striking trees, each bolt traces the outlines of forgotten paths—ancient routes that shimmer into existence for a heartbeat before fading, beckoning you forward.

You follow one of these glowing trails, the forest floor now a carpet of soft moss that cushions each step. The air is alive with whispers—voices of the trees, of the wind, of the rain—telling stories of seasons past. A massive oak, its bark etched with glowing runes, bends toward you, its branches forming an archway. As you pass beneath it, a spray of silver rain cascades over you, not wet but feeling like cool, silken threads that wrap around your shoulders.

When you emerge on the other side, the storm has transformed. The sky clears, revealing a twilight canopy ablaze with a thousand stars, each one pulsing in time with the lingering rhythm of the thunder. A gentle rain continues, now a fine mist that glitters like dust motes in the starlight, settling on your hair and eyelashes, making you feel as if the universe itself is breathing through you.

In the distance, a crystal lake mirrors the sky, its surface perfectly still. You walk toward it, and as you approach, the water ripples—not from wind, but from your reflection. When you look down, you see not only your own face but also a faint, luminous outline of a path that leads beyond the lake, winding through hills made of clouds and mountains that sparkle with the light of distant suns.

You step onto the path, feeling the cool mist rise up to meet you, and with each step the forest fades, the storm dissolves, and the dream expands into a boundless horizon—an ever‑changing tapestry of light, sound, and wonder, inviting you to wander wherever your heart wishes to go.
