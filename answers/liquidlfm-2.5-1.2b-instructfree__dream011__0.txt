The questions are glowing on the screen, each pulsing with contrasting truths. One asks, *"What do you value in leadership?"* Another whispers, *"Is it empathy, innovation, or perfection?"* The third urges, *"How can you bridge the gap between art and science?"*  

You pause, scribbling notes on a pad unlike any you’ve seen—pages that shimmer with stars you don’t see. Your hand trembles as you realize the answers aren’t in your textbook but in the silence between your thoughts. The room blurs, and you hear a voice, not words, but a feeling: *"Your future is not just a path, but a resonance."*  

You close your eyes, and the questions dissolve into a single, radiant line:  

**"What course will you take?"**  

When you open your eyes, the exam is gone. The room is quiet, but the weight of the final exam feels lighter. You realize you already chose your future—not in any syllabus, but in the story only you can tell. 🌟
