...written in a language I don't recognize. 

The script is fluid and elegant, like wind-carved ice, but utterly alien. My heart hammers in my chest, a frantic drum against the sudden silence of the exam hall. Around me, other students are scribbling furiously, brows furrowed in concentration. Do they understand? Are they fluent in this strange, swirling calligraphy?

Panic, cold and sharp, slices through me. This exam dictates my placement in the Chronal Guild, the organization responsible for maintaining the intricate tapestry of time. A low score condemns me to mundane chronal sanitation, scrubbing temporal anomalies in the forgotten corners of history. A high score… a high score leads to the prestigious Chronal Weaver program, a life of adventure and influence, manipulating the strands of time itself. 

I look at the proctor, a woman with eyes like polished obsidian, hovering at the front of the room. She offers me a smile that holds no warmth, only an unsettling expectation. I try to formulate a question, but my tongue feels thick and clumsy. How can I ask for clarification in a language I don't even understand?

Desperation fuels a surge of adrenaline. I stare at the first question, tracing the alien symbols with a trembling finger. Maybe it's a code. Maybe there's a key hidden somewhere within the script itself. I begin to analyze the shapes, the curves, the seemingly random dots and flourishes. 

Suddenly, a single symbol flickers, shimmering like a mirage. It detaches itself from the page and floats in the air before me, pulsating with a soft, inner light. I reach out tentatively and touch it.

Instantly, a flood of understanding washes over me. Not of the language itself, but of the *concept* behind the symbol. It's not a word, not a letter, but a representation of a fundamental principle of temporal manipulation – a concept of fluidity, of shifting possibilities, of the delicate balance between cause and effect. 

I look back at the exam paper. The swirling script is still unfamiliar, but now I see it with new eyes. It's not a test of knowledge, but of intuition, of instinct, of the ability to *feel* the flow of time. 

I pick up my pen, my hand steady now. I don't need to understand the language. I need to understand the *river*. 

And as I begin to write, the swirling script starts to transform, shifting and changing under my pen, becoming something I somehow recognize, something profoundly familiar… like the echo of a forgotten dream.
