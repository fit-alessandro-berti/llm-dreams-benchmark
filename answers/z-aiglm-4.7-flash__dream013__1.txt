...you realize that the maze isn't growing larger, but that the distance between the puzzles is shrinking. The geometric knots on the walls begin to writhe, no longer looking like mathematical formulas but like the roots of a tree grasping at the sky. You reach the final puzzle—a massive monolith inscribed with a question that changes the moment you blink—and the stone vibrates with your own heartbeat. With a sudden, quiet understanding, you stop trying to solve it with logic and instead accept the answer. The walls dissolve into mist, leaving you standing in a field of tall grass where the sun is a constant, silent circle, and you realize you aren't lost anymore; you are finally awake.
