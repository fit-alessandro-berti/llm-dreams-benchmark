symbols etched into its surface, glowing faintly under the dim light of the room. The patterns seem to shift and rearrange themselves as you watch, forming strange, almost familiar shapes—like fragments of a forgotten language.  

A soft hum emanates from the box, growing louder as you reach out to touch it. The moment your fingers brush against the cold metal, a sudden warmth spreads through your hand, and the symbols flare to life, pulsing with a deep blue light.  

A whisper, barely audible, drifts through the air—*"Only the seeker of truth may open what is hidden."*  

You feel a strange pull, as if the box is testing you, waiting for something. Then, a small compartment slides open on its own, revealing a single, ancient-looking key resting inside. But as you reach for it, the dream shifts—  

You wake up, your heart pounding, the echo of the whisper still lingering in your mind. And on your bedside table... lies the same key.  

What do you do next?
