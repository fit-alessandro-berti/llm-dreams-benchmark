You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and each one pulls you into their bizarre orbit.

First, there's a cluster of laughing executives in pinstripe suits, sipping glowing blue cocktails that taste like forgotten childhood memories. They corner you, insisting you join their game of "Corporate Limbo"—how low can you go without selling your soul? You duck under an invisible bar that keeps lowering, your back aching, until one whispers your name like it's a stock ticker, and you slip away, heart pounding.

Next, a circle of artists with paint-splattered faces huddle around a canvas that's painting *itself*, swirling with colors that whisper secrets. They hand you a brush dipped in midnight ink and beg you to add "the missing stroke" that will make the world right. Your hand trembles as you paint a door, but it leads nowhere—just echoes of laughter. You back out, the canvas now depicting your face.

Deeper in, you stumble into philosophers in togas made of newspaper headlines, debating if reality is just a poorly scripted dream. One grabs your arm: "If you seek one soul amid the many, are you the dreamer or the dreamed?" Their words twist your thoughts into knots, time looping as you argue infinity in a single breath. You shake free, dizzy.

Then, the musicians—drummers with hearts for drumheads, violinists plucking strings of spider silk. Their rhythm syncs to your pulse, pulling you into a dance where feet never touch ground. Whirling violins sing your one friend's name like a siren call, but the crowd thickens, bodies blurring into a human fog.

Finally, pushing through a wall of velvet curtains that feel like eyelids, you burst into a quiet alcove. There they are—your one person—sitting cross-legged, offering a single, perfect cupcake that tastes like home. "I was waiting," they say, eyes like stars. The party fades to whispers, the ground softens to clouds...

And then you wake up, the echo of laughter lingering in your ears, wondering if the gathering was real after all. Sweet dreams?
