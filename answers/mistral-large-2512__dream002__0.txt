The wind begins to howl through the ancient trees, their gnarled branches twisting like skeletal fingers against the darkening sky. The air grows thick and heavy, charged with an eerie electricity that prickles against your skin. A distant rumble of thunder rolls through the forest, vibrating in your chest, and the first fat raindrops splatter against the mossy ground—cold and sudden, as if the storm has been holding its breath.

Then, the trees *move*.

Not swaying in the wind—no, they *shift*, their roots slithering free of the earth like serpents, their trunks bending unnaturally as if stretching after a long sleep. The leaves whisper in a language just beyond understanding, a chorus of rustling voices that coil around your thoughts. The path ahead splits into three: one winding deeper into the storm, another leading to a crumbling stone archway half-swallowed by ivy, and the third… the third simply *ends*, dissolving into a swirling mist that pulses with faint, golden light.

A figure steps from the shadows—a silhouette at first, then a woman (or something like one) with skin like bark and eyes like polished river stones. She tilts her head, and the rain parts around her as if she’s the storm’s center. *"You shouldn’t be here,"* she murmurs, though her lips don’t move. *"The forest remembers. And it’s hungry tonight."*

Behind you, the trees groan. The path you came from is gone.

**What do you do?**

(Do you follow the mist? Run toward the archway? Or turn to face the storm—and the thing that’s no longer a woman?)
