# The Dream Continues

...and they keep shifting positions. Every time I think I spot my friend across the room, the crowd rearranges itself like a living puzzle.

I navigate past a group having an intense discussion about something that seems vitally important to them, though I can't quite catch the words. They're speaking in a language that sounds almost familiar. One of them turns and smiles at me encouragingly, as if I'm supposed to join in, but I politely drift past.

The gathering seems to expand the deeper I go. New rooms keep appearing—a library where people are reading books that have blank pages, a garden indoors where flowers bloom and wilt in seconds. 

I catch a glimpse of my friend's jacket around a corner, but when I hurry toward it, I find myself back where I started. The music shifts from ambient to almost frantic, and I realize I can't quite remember what my friend looks like anymore, only that finding them felt urgent.

Someone offers me a drink that tastes like colors. Another person asks if I've found what I'm looking for, and I answer honestly: \ not entirely sure anymore.\: *everyone* seems to be looking for someone too.
