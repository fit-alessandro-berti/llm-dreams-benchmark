…written in a handwriting you recognize too well: yours, but not quite—like you wrote them in a hurry, half-asleep, and tried to make them look official.

The first page is a standard multiple-choice sheet, except every question is a “choose all that apply,” and every option is a version of your own name.

**1. Identify the person best suited to succeed.**  
A) You, as you are.  
B) You, if you stop apologizing.  
C) You, if you never fail again.  
D) You, if you allow yourself to learn in public.  
E) You, if you leave.

You look up to ask the proctor if this is some kind of joke, but the proctor’s face keeps refusing to settle into focus, like a paused video that won’t buffer. The room is full of students, all hunched in identical postures, all scratching the same pencil rhythm—except when you look closer, their exam booklets are blank, and they’re only pretending to write. They’re all pretending with desperate concentration, as if the pretending is the test.

Your pencil feels too light, almost weightless. It makes a sound like chalk even though it’s graphite.

The second page is essay.

**2. Explain, in complete sentences, what you think you’re trying to prove. Provide examples.**

You swallow, and the pages flutter on their own, as if a draft is turning them. The exam is no longer printed on paper. It’s printed on thin slices of something like onion skin, translucent enough to show the next question underneath.

**3. Show your work.**  
Below it is a box filled with your memories, arranged like math problems: a classroom where you answered too quickly and someone laughed; a job interview where you smiled too hard; a night you stayed awake rewriting an email until the sun came up.

On the far wall, a clock ticks in a language you don’t understand. Instead of numbers, it has words: **LATER, SOON, NEVER, NOW.** The second hand keeps pointing to NOW and shuddering, as if it’s stuck.

You try to write something—anything—and your pencil writes without your permission:

*I promise I will become acceptable.*

The sentence looks wrong the moment it appears, like it’s borrowing someone else’s life.

A low murmur runs through the room. You realize the other students have stopped pretending. They’re watching you. Not with malice, exactly. With hunger. Like they’re hoping you’ll discover the trick and tell them.

You flip to the final page.

**FINAL QUESTION (MANDATORY).**  
**4. In one word, what do you want?**  
(Answers must be in ink. No erasing.)

Your desk has no pen. The room has no ink. Your mouth tastes like pennies.

You look down at your hands and see your fingertips are stained faintly blue, as if you’ve already been writing with a pen you can’t see. When you press your finger to the paper, it leaves a small mark—like a bruise.

You whisper, “Is this—” but your voice doesn’t make sound. Instead, the page answers by rearranging the words.

**No partial credit.**  
**No extra time.**  
**No appeals.**

The proctor finally moves. They glide, not walk, between the rows. Their shoes don’t squeak. Their shadow arrives before they do.

They stop at your desk and set something down: a small, sealed envelope with your name typed on it, perfectly centered. The paper is warm, as if it’s been kept close to someone’s skin.

You hesitate, then slide a finger under the seal.

Inside is a single slip of paper.

It reads:

*You already took this exam.*

A chill travels up your arms. You turn the slip over.

On the back is your score.

Not a number. A sentence:

*You passed, but you did not believe it.*

The classroom seems to inhale. The walls pull back a little, making the room wider than it should be. The other students’ faces sharpen into focus, and you recognize them, one by one—not as strangers, but as versions of you from different times: you at sixteen with the too-loud laugh, you at twenty with the careful mask, you from last month with the tired eyes. Each one holds an exam booklet with your handwriting.

The proctor leans down, close enough that you can smell library dust and winter air.

“This is the part,” they say, and now you can hear them perfectly, “where you stop taking tests you invented.”

You glance back at the final question.

**In one word, what do you want?**

Your finger hovers over the paper. Your stomach twists, not because you don’t know the answer, but because you do, and it’s not the kind of answer that earns applause.

You press your fingertip to the page and write, slowly, like you’re learning how to spell.

**Enough.**

The room goes silent. The clock on the wall stops shuddering. The word NOW spreads across its face like ink in water, washing over LATER and SOON and NEVER until there’s only one thing left.

The proctor nods once, as if that was the correct response all along.

The exam booklet dissolves into blank pages. The desks become ordinary wood. The fluorescent lights soften into the color of late afternoon.

And then, as if someone has opened a door you hadn’t noticed before, you feel air move across your face—real air, outdoor air, carrying the smell of rain on hot pavement.

You stand, and no one stops you.

As you walk toward the back of the room, the students—your other selves—watch, and their shoulders loosen, as if your movement gave them permission to unclench. A few of them begin to lift their pencils. One laughs, quietly, with relief.

At the exit, you look back once.

The proctor is no longer a person. It’s just a mirror hung at the front of the room, tilted slightly downward, reflecting the empty teacher’s desk and the open window behind it.

Outside, the sky is the color of a clean sheet of paper.

You step through the doorway.

And the bell rings—not a harsh school bell, but a small, clear chime, like a spoon against a glass.

When you wake up, your hand is resting on your chest, and your fingers are stained faintly blue, as if you’ve been holding an invisible pen all night.
