**Dream Continuation: *The Forgotten Valley***

---

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and pine, and the only sounds are the distant call of birds and the rustle of leaves. As you sit up, your fingers brush against rough, woven fabric—you’re dressed in simple, undyed linen, the kind that might belong to a peasant or a traveler. Your bare feet press into cool, loamy soil.

You’re in a valley, nestled between towering, mist-shrouded mountains. The landscape is wild and untamed, with no signs of roads, cities, or even smoke from distant hearths. The sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows, and the light has a strange, golden hue—like the world is bathed in honey. You realize with a jolt that you don’t recognize the constellations above you. *Where—or when—am I?*

### **The First Signs of Life**
As you stand, you notice a narrow path winding down the valley, half-hidden by ferns and brambles. It looks like it’s been trodden by feet, not hooves or wheels. Following it, you come upon a small clearing where a circle of standing stones looms, their surfaces carved with spirals and symbols that make your head ache if you stare too long. At the center of the circle, a single stone slab lies flat, its surface stained dark in places. *An altar? A table?*

Then you hear it—a whisper of voices, carried on the wind. You duck behind a boulder just as three figures emerge from the tree line.

1. **The Hooded Figure** – Tall and gaunt, wrapped in a cloak of patchwork hides. Their face is obscured by a deep hood, but their hands—long-fingered and pale—clutch a staff topped with a glowing, blue crystal. They move with eerie silence, as if they’re barely touching the ground.
2. **The Hunter** – A broad-shouldered woman with a bow slung over her back, her dark hair braided with feathers. She wears a tunic of stitched leather and carries a knife at her belt. Her eyes are sharp, scanning the trees like she’s expecting trouble.
3. **The Child** – A small, wide-eyed boy no older than ten, dressed in a tunic too large for him. He clutches a woven satchel and stares at the standing stones with a mix of fear and fascination. When he speaks, his voice is high and clear. *"They say the old ones still walk here. That if you listen at dusk, you can hear them singing under the stones."*

The Hooded Figure raises a hand, and the blue crystal flares. *"Enough talk. The veil is thin tonight. We must be quick."* They turn toward the altar stone—and that’s when they see *you*.

### **The Choice**
Your heart pounds. Do you:
- **Step forward and speak?** Maybe they know how you got here—or how to get back. But what if they’re not friendly?
- **Hide and follow them?** The Hooded Figure’s staff is clearly magical. If they’re heading somewhere important, they might have answers.
- **Run?** The valley feels alive in a way that’s both beautiful and terrifying. Maybe you should find shelter before nightfall.
- **Examine the standing stones first?** The symbols pulse faintly, as if reacting to your presence. Perhaps they hold a clue—or a warning.
