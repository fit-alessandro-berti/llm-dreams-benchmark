Okay, sinking deeper into the dream...

...the questions are **moving**. Tiny, intricate symbols, like miniature clockwork insects, crawl across the page, rearranging themselves constantly. Just as you think you recognize a word or a formula, it dissolves and reforms into something completely different – a snippet of a song lyric you haven't heard in years, a diagram of a heart with too many chambers, a caricature of your third-grade teacher scowling.

Panic starts to prickle at the back of your neck. You grip your pen, but how can you answer something that won't stay still? You glance at the student next to you. They aren't writing; they're *weaving*. Threads of iridescent light spool from their fingertips, creating a complex tapestry on their desk where the exam paper should be.

You look back at your own paper. The crawling symbols now coalesce briefly into a single, terrifyingly simple question written in your own childhood handwriting:

**"What makes you think you deserve this?"**

Before you can even process it, the letters dissolve again, replaced by rapidly spinning spirals that make you dizzy. The clock on the wall isn't ticking; it's melting, dripping silently onto the floor like thick honey. The air grows heavy, smelling faintly of chalk dust and ozone. You feel an overwhelming certainty that you forgot to wear shoes, and that somehow, *this* is the real reason you're going to fail. Your future hangs precariously, balanced on the point of a constantly shifting, unanswerable question.
