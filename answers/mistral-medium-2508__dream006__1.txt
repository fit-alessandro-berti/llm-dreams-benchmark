speak—but instead of words, a deep, resonant hum fills the room, vibrating through the floorboards and the chests of every person in the audience. The air shimmers like heat off pavement, and the faces before you begin to blur, their features melting into swirling colors: golds, blues, and violets that pulse in time with the sound.

Then, the stage beneath you *shifts*. It’s no longer wood or carpet—it’s living, breathing earth, warm and damp, and roots coil up around your ankles like curious serpents. The crowd isn’t human anymore, either. They’re trees, their bark rough and ancient, their leaves rustling in a wind you can’t feel. Their branches stretch toward you, not in menace but in *invitation*.

A voice—your own, yet deeper, older—spills from your mouth: *"You’ve been speaking all your life, but never like this."* The roots tighten gently, lifting you upward, and suddenly you’re no longer on the stage but *inside* the largest tree, its hollow trunk a cathedral of glowing veins. The audience-trees lean in, their roots intertwining beneath the soil, forming a vast, pulsing network.

You realize: this isn’t a speech. It’s a *conversation*. The trees are showing you their memories—flashes of storms, of fires, of quiet centuries watching civilizations rise and crumble like autumn leaves. They’re asking you a question, not with words but with the press of sap against your palms: *"What will you grow in the time you’re given?"*

And then—
The roots release you. You’re back on the stage, gasping, the crowd now human again, blinking in confusion. Someone in the front row clears their throat. The microphone crackles.

*"Uh…"* you say, your voice small and mortal once more. *"So. Who here likes… trees?"*

The audience erupts in laughter, but a few people exchange glances, their eyes a little too knowing. And as you stumble into your prepared remarks, you can’t shake the feeling that the roots are still there, just beneath the floor, waiting.
