begin mapping your mental route, recalling fragments of a faded old map and any vague instructions you might have received. You calculate distances to nearby landmarks while observing the bustling crowd for any familiar signs or symbols. Just as you're about to panic, an old friend from a bygone year approaches and is clearly smiling, waving you down. Upon exchanging a knowing look, they gently guide you by the hand, leading you gracefully to the heart of the city where you find the meeting spot waiting for you. The meeting goes smoothly, thanks in part to a unexpected twist in plans catalyzed by your friend's timely intervention.
