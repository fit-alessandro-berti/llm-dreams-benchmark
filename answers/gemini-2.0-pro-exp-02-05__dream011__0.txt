...written in a language you've never seen before. Not just a foreign language, but symbols that twist and writhe on the page, like tiny, inky snakes constantly rearranging themselves. My heart hammers against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat against the rising tide of panic. I look around the vast, echoing examination hall. Everyone else is scribbling furiously, their pens scratching against the paper, a sound that is somehow amplified and oppressive in the silence. They seem completely unfazed.

I glance at the invigilator, a tall, gaunt figure with eyes that seem to see right through me. He's standing perfectly still at the front, his gaze fixed on some distant point beyond the walls. He offers no help, no hint of understanding. I try to ask him a question, but my voice catches in my throat, a strangled croak that dies unheard.

Desperately, I flip through the exam booklet. Page after page of the same writhing, incomprehensible script. Then, on the very last page, I see something familiar. A single, small drawing. It’s a crudely sketched image of… a key. A very specific key, with a distinctive, jagged tooth and a small, almost imperceptible, bird etched into the handle. It’s *my* key. The key to the old, dusty trunk in my attic, the one I haven’t opened since I was a child.

Suddenly, a rush of memories flood my mind: the smell of mothballs and dried lavender, the feel of the rough, wooden lid, the glint of sunlight on forgotten treasures. And a whisper, a feeling… that the answers, whatever they are, aren’t in this room, on this paper. They’re in that trunk.

The invigilator starts to walk towards me, his footsteps heavy and deliberate. The room seems to be shrinking, the walls closing in. I know, with a certainty that chills me to the bone, that I have to *leave*. Now. I stand up, my chair scraping loudly against the floor, the sound echoing like a gunshot in the oppressive silence. All eyes turn to me, blank, uncomprehending… and then, faintly, I hear a bird sing, a melodic trill from outside the window, a sound that shouldn't be there, in this sterile, suffocating hall. It's the same bird from the key...

I have to get to that trunk.
