in a language you've never seen before. The characters are intricate and mysterious, unlike anything you've ever encountered. You feel a pang of panic, but then you remember a childhood friend who used to speak in a made-up language just for fun. You close your eyes and take a deep breath, trying to recall the patterns and rules of that imaginary language. As you open your eyes, the characters on the exam paper begin to shift and change, slowly transforming into words you can understand. You take your pen and start to write, feeling a strange sense of calm and confidence. The exam questions are complex, but you find yourself able to answer them with ease, as if you've been preparing for this moment your entire life. As you finish the last question, you look up and see that the classroom has transformed into a vast, open field. You stand up, walk out of the classroom, and into the sunlight, feeling ready to embrace whatever comes next.
