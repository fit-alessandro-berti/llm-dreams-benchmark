...realize that I'm wearing a pair of fluffy rabbit slippers instead of shoes. I feel a wave of panic wash over me as I try to remember why I put them on in the first place. The audience starts to murmur and snicker, and I attempt to laugh it off, but my voice comes out squeaky and high-pitched.

Just as I'm about to start speaking, the lights in the auditorium begin to flicker and dim. The crowd starts to get restless, and I'm worried that I'll be stuck on stage in the dark. But then, a spotlight shines down on me, illuminating a microphone that suddenly appears in front of me.

I clear my throat to begin my speech, but instead of my voice, the sound of "Who Let the Dogs Out?" starts blasting through the speakers. I try to start again, but my words are drowned out by a chorus of barking dogs and cheering cats (yes, cats!) in the front row.

I attempt to regain control of the situation, but my mind goes blank, and I start to speak in a language that sounds suspiciously like gibberish. To my surprise, the audience erupts in applause, cheering and whistling as if I'm delivering the most brilliant speech they've ever heard.

Feeling more confident, I continue to improvise, speaking in a mixture of nonsensical words and bizarre slogans. The audience loves it, and I start to feel like I'm on top of the world – until, that is, I trip over my fluffy rabbit slippers and fall off the stage. Everything goes black, and I wake up, laughing and feeling a bit silly, with the phrase " encore, encore!" echoing in my head.
