…the air tightens, as if the whole world takes a sharp breath. Leaves pivot their faces to the wind. The path ahead blurs into quicksilver as the first drops fall—large, warm, deliberate. A low groan rolls through the trunks, not thunder but something older, like the forest clearing its throat.

You pull your collar up, but your hands are wet with a fine, glittering rain that smells faintly of oranges and old books. The sky does not darken so much as deepen, as though it has been filled with ink and stirred. Lightning sketches the silhouettes of antlers in the clouds. The storm steps closer.

When it arrives, it does not break over you; it kneels. The rain softens into a steady whisper. Each drop that lands on your skin carries a small weight, not water but memory. A birthday candle. The left shoe you lost under a couch. The sound of your name said by someone who no longer says it. They slide down your forearms in quicksilver tracks and sink into the ground where ferns shiver and unfurl as if remembering too.

The wind shapes itself into a path of swaying branches, and you follow. The forest floor glows dimly with a bioluminescent moss that lights with your steps, so your footprints are constellations. Above, the canopy opens and closes like a slow-moving mouth, tasting the rain. The storm’s center is a clearing you don’t remember ever seeing before, and yet you know the exact number of stones that ring it, the way you know the number of teeth in your own mouth.

At the center stands a tree so tall it seems to be wearing the cloud as a hat. Lightning forks down and threads into its bark, not burning but weaving. With every flash, carvings appear: faces you’ve seen on trains, the odd glance exchanged in supermarkets, a moth caught against a window. The tree hums. Its leaves are pages. Its branches turn like the hands of a slow clock.

You step closer and notice that the rain stops just at the edge of the clearing, held back as if by a glass dome. The silence inside is tender. You can hear your own pulse, and then, beneath it, another heartbeat that keeps time with the thunder, patient and enormous.

“Come,” says the tree, not with words, but with a tilt of its shadow. You reach out and lay your palm against its trunk. The bark is warm, rough, familiar. A warmth climbs your arm and spreads through your chest, filling spaces you forgot were empty. You see a small kitchen with a yellow curtain. You see a bridge in winter, footsteps on frosted planks. You see yourself, smaller and braver, turning a key in a door. The storm seems to be paging through you like a book, pausing on the torn corners.

A squirrel with a soaked tail darts across the ring of stones and stops at your foot, looking up with the frankness animals have in dreams. It drops a single acorn at your toe, a perfect sphere lacquered by the rain. When you pick it up, it is heavier than it should be. It is a planet. It is a bell that does not ring. It is a word you do not yet know how to say.

You put it in your pocket, and the pocket becomes a hole with stars inside.

Around the clearing, the storm shifts without moving. You sense it rethink itself. Thunder exhales. The air tastes like mint for a breath and then like metal. Your hair lifts, not from static but from attention. Something is being decided.

The path you took here is gone, replaced by two trails: one of wet footprints leading back toward the known trees; one of dry leaves spiraling deeper, vanishing into the dark like a question mark curling into itself. The tree places the ghost of a hand on your shoulder—the press of bark, a knot like a knuckle—and without eyes it watches you choose.

You step onto the dry leaves and they don’t crunch. They murmur, telling a story to your ankles. The storm follows, gracious as a curtain being drawn. Lightning gathers itself into a lantern, hovering just above your left shoulder, bright enough to show you spider silk jeweled with rain, dull enough to keep the stars honest. The wind reaches into your hair, loosening a single strand and tying it to a passing moth, so that when it flutters ahead you feel yourself tethered to its small courage.

The deeper you go, the more the forest changes shape around your own breath. Ferns lean in to listen. Rocks take on the softness of pillows. At the edge of the world, you find a pavilion made of ribs and ivy, and beyond it an ocean that wasn’t there a minute ago, black and mirror-smooth, reflecting a sky full of slow-burning meteors. The rain stops. The storm sits beside you like a dog, panting quietly. Steam rises from the surface of the water, and in it you read sentences that make and unmake themselves. Each reads, for a moment, like a promise.

“Are you ready?” asks the ocean, and your answer is the sound of your breath, which is yes and no and I have been ready forever.

You take the lantern lightning in your hands and set it on the water. It floats, shivering, and then begins to move, not away from you but around you, drawing a wide circle that you recognize from a teacher’s chalkboard, from the way cat’s eyes narrow at noon. When it completes the ring, there is a door where there was not.

You do not knock. You place your planet-bell-word acorn against the seam and it opens with the smell of rain on hot stone. Inside: a room with no corners, walls made of all the nights you’ve ever slept through, floor of every song you forgot you loved. In the center, a chair. On the chair, the coat you lost when you were thirteen. In the pocket, a letter in your handwriting and a key that fits no lock. The letter says, simply: Remember.

You put on the coat. It fits perfectly. You take the key and it is warm. The storm stands up and shakes itself, shedding a second sky that falls to the floor and lifts again as birds.

When you step back through the door, the ocean has become a meadow of reeds. The lantern returns to the cloud. The tree is far behind, its pages turning more slowly now. The rain is a fine mist, a lace veil, and then nothing.

The forest is peaceful again, but not the same peace. Everything is a half shade sharper, as if outlined in soft chalk. The path you choose shows itself in small, kind gestures: a mushroom like a white button at the base of a stump; a smooth stone you put in your mouth just to feel, and it tastes like a word you will remember upon waking.

You walk. The leaves fall upward. Somewhere a bell rings that is not a bell but the acorn in your pocket deciding, quietly, to become a tree. A gust brushes your face with the scent of oranges and old books, and you know the storm has not ended—it has only turned into time. And it is, very gently, raining you back into the world.
