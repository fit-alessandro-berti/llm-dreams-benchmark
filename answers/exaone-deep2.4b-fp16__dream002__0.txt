You walk through the forest until the trees grow closer, their branches trembling like fragile hands reaches for clouds. Thunder booms suddenly behind you, sharp and sharpening. Shifting light refrains into jagged streaks, while the air turns damp, tangcing on your throat. A cloud coalesces overhead, its edges bubbling with rain that pools just below the surface—like waterlogged soil.  

No one noticing the change, you continue your path, but the ground shivers underfoot. A branch splits in mid-air, danting away a fragment of the cloud’s fury. Suddenly, the rain starts pouring steadily. You trip, flipping over an intervening tree trunk. Between your shoulders, a bolt of lightning cracks the sky, illuminating a path of lightning bolts snaking through the dark. Your breath hitches. The storm, you think, halts here, though you feel the same urgency pushing you onward—as if the wind is pulling you along, carrying a echo of your own fear. When the gust finally subsides, the rain lags behind, and the sky becomes a smog of gray. You sit still, waiting for the calm to descend again... until the first light pierces the clouds, cold and pale but serene.  

What do you see next?
