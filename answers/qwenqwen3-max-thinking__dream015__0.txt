...decide to **plant a garden**.

It sounds foolish, even mad, in a world of rusted cars, skeletal buildings, and whispering winds that carry the scent of decay. But your hands remember—remember tilling soil, cradling seeds, watching green push stubbornly through gray. So, in the hollowed-out husk of an old library, beneath a stained-glass window depicting forgotten myths, you kneel.

The earth here is poisoned, cracked with thirst. You spend days hauling buckets of rainwater collected on rooftops, filtering it through layers of cloth and charcoal. You scavenge for seeds—not in stores, long looted—but in the pockets of abandoned coats, in the curled pages of gardening manuals, even in the dried husks clinging to weeds pushing through sidewalk fractures.  

Neighbors watch you, gaunt and wary. "Waste of water," mutters Old Man Harker, his eyes hollow as bullet casings. "Raiders’ll take it all before a sprout shows."  

But you keep digging.  

Then—**green**. A defiant curl of kale. A trembling tomato vine. Beans winding up a trellis made of rebar. The garden becomes a secret rebellion against despair. Others start leaving scraps: a dented can of compost, a chipped watering can, a child’s careful sketch of a sunflower taped to a broken shelf.  

One evening, as you pat soil around a pepper plant, Harker appears at the edge of the plot. He doesn’t speak. Just drops a handful of wrinkled carrot seeds into your palm—seeds he’s carried for years, "in case the world ever deserved them again."  

The garden doesn’t feed everyone. Not yet. But it feeds *hope*. And in this broken world, hope is the rarest resource of all.  

You decide to plant more.
