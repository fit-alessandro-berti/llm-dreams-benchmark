…not questions at all but prompts that feel alive, pulsing beneath the paper:

1. “Weigh a sigh in grams, then explain how you would spend its currency.”
2. “Translate the laughter of a child into an equation—show all steps.”
3. “Describe the color midnight in five metaphors, then offer it a name.”
4. “Sketch the shape of your own ambition; annotate its jagged edges.”
5. “Prove that tomorrow exists, using only memories you’ve never had.”

Your pen hovers. You look around the exam hall: desks dissolve into rippling pools, overhead lights blur into lanterns floating on a sea of indigo. The other students—faces half‐formed—are already writing, their pens dripping ink like falling stars.

A hush spreads. The proctor’s voice, echoing from somewhere deep in your chest, intones: “Begin when you’re ready.”

You inhale. The paper warms beneath your fingers, as if eager for your answers. You realize this isn’t a test of facts or formulas—it’s a test of imagination, of courage to define the undefinable. You smile, lean in, and with steady strokes begin:

• “A sigh weighs nothing, yet carries the heft of all the words we never spoke; I’d spend it on forgiveness, because that’s priceless.”  
• “Laughter is a series of ascending arcs—y = sin(x) amplified by the heart’s resonance…”  
• “Midnight is velvet draped over silence; a raven’s wing at rest; the hush between two notes; I name it ‘Ebonis.’”  
• “My ambition is a star with fractured light, each shard a dream I’ve not yet chased.”  
• “Tomorrow is the shadow of today’s hope; its existence proven by every plan I’m brave enough to make.”

As your pen moves, the room brightens—the pools solidify back into desks and the floating lanterns settle into lamps. The other students pause, their faces clearing, nodding at your answers as if they’ve found permission to think differently.

The proctor offers you a small smile. The dream‐exam dissolves. You wake in your bed, heart pounding with exhilaration, clutching a stray sheet of paper—blank, save for the faintest imprint of the word “Begin.”
