You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and you find yourself seeking shelter in a small, dilapidated cabin. As you enter, the storm outside rages on, but inside, you find a sense of calm. The cabin, although old and musty, provides a safe haven from the storm. You sit down on a dusty chair and look around. The cabin is filled with old books and artifacts. Curious, you begin to explore the items. Suddenly, the door creaks open once more, and a figure steps inside. You turn around to see who it is.}
