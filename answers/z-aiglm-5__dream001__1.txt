You start to run, but your legs feel heavy and sluggish, as if you’re trying to sprint through deep water. The pavement beneath your feet softens into a trampoline-like substance, making every step a silent, effortful bounce.

You fumble for your phone to check the address, but when you unlock the screen, the map app is replaced by a single, pulsating eye that blinks in time with your heartbeat. You shove the phone back into your pocket and look up.

The skyscrapers around you begin to ripple. The glass facades turn into liquid mirrors, reflecting a version of yourself that is wearing clothes you’ve never owned. You spot a sign that reads *“Conference Room B”* on a door that is floating three feet off the ground. 

Desperate, you reach for the doorknob, but just as your fingers graze the metal, the door melts away into a swarm of blackbirds that scatter into a sky that is suddenly a swirling Van Gogh painting of stars. You check your watch—the hour is up, but the hands are spinning backward. You realize with a jolt that the meeting isn't in a building, but inside the pocket of the coat you are currently wearing. You reach inside and pull out a small, glowing room.
