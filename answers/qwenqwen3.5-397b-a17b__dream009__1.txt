...find the library before the sun sets, not to read a book, but to find the page where your name is written in ink that hasn't dried yet.

The air smells of woodsmoke, unwashed wool, and damp earth. Your clothes feel wrong—too smooth, too synthetic against the rough gaze of the passersby. You check your pockets, hoping for a phone, a watch, anything, but they are filled only with smooth river stones that weren't there a moment ago. 

A bell tolls in the distance, but it strikes thirteen times. The shadows are stretching too long for the time of day, reaching for your ankles like dark water. You understand now, with the absolute certainty that only exists in sleep, that if you don't find that page and blow the ink dry before the thirteenth echo fades, you will become a character in a story written centuries ago, forever bound to the paper, waiting for someone else to dream you awake.
