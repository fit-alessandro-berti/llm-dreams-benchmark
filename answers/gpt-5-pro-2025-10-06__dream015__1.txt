…build something that outlives you.

You choose a half-collapsed subway platform where the tiles still hold the shine of old rain. The mosaic along the wall shows glassy blue fish forever swimming upstream. It feels lucky. You sweep broken bottles into glittering dunes and drag wooden benches into a rough square. It becomes a room the way a circle of fire becomes a home.

Food first, then light, then a voice. That’s your order.

You pry soil from rooftop planters and scrape it from abandoned window boxes, mixing it with pulverized charcoal and all the coffee grounds you can find in a shuttered café. You stitch a greenhouse skin from billboard vinyl and cable ties. The ribs are scavenged conduit. For water, there’s a rusting cistern five stories up with a good seam; you thread a rubber hose through a stairwell like a vein and teach it to siphon. At the low point in the tunnel a tiny river starts. It sounds like someone breathing.

There’s a radio in the stationmaster’s booth, something old and boxy with its own smell, like dust and warm pennies. You cannibalize a bicycle for the crank and bolt it to the desk. Electricity becomes something you earn: twenty minutes of pedaling for one burst of speech. You test the microphone with your name. You haven’t said it aloud in days. It fits your mouth like a key that still turns.

“Is anyone there?” you ask the dark. “I’m at the place with the fish on the wall. I’m planting.” You say it again, because the second time it sounds truer.

The city above is a museum of weather. On the surface you move through rooms of air—hot, sudden, flaked with ash, smelling of cinnamon or iodine. You learn which streets are claimed by wind, which by crows. You don’t bother the dogs and the dogs don’t bother you. The sky is the color of a bruise that never decides what day it was hurt. You are careful and quiet and you only take what you can carry. A seed packet? Precious. A coil of copper wire? Priceless. A cracked mirror? A heliograph if you’re stubborn enough.

Back underground, your garden invents itself. Mustard sprouts like green confetti, radishes push their red shoulders through the dirt. A potato you once forgot in a cupboard has forgiven you and arrived with tiny flags. Some leaves are peppery, some tart, all of them miraculous. You keep a ledger in a school notebook, naming what grows as if that makes it safer: arugula, lamb’s quarters, volunteer sunflower, the wayward bean.

On the radio, static has moods. You begin to recognize them. There’s the rustle of far rain and the whisper of empty rooms and the sudden glitter of a voice that doesn’t quite cohere. One evening, after pedal and breath and prayer, something cuts cleanly through the white noise:

“—seeds—”

You say, “Yes.”

“—and bees,” the voice adds, like the end of a joke you haven’t heard. Coordinates follow, half a rhyme, half a map: “Where winter is inside out.”

It’s the conservatory you passed two days ago, its glass ribcage broken, ferns growing upside down, snow preserved as dust. You go at dawn. The iron gates give after you talk to them with a crowbar and a good memory of hinges. Inside, the air smells like a spilled afternoon. The seed bank is a fractured drawer of alphabetized hope: amaranth to zinnia, neat envelopes that survived by believing in envelopes. You take a careful handful and leave a promise under the ones you can’t carry: a note that says, “I’ll come back,” plus a little packet of radish seeds in trade.

Beside the catalogs you find something that lives—a hive in a terracotta pipe, drowsy with shade. You speak softly the way you would to a skittish horse or a child waking from a nap. You carry them home like a candle.

Days become a braid: forage, fix, plant, broadcast. You start snaring light. On the roof, you glue mirrors to a scaffolding of rebar so the sun can be herded. At noon, the station’s stairwell turns into a slow river of brightness that freezes halfway down, caught and redirected by your glittering invention. Underground, it breaks into coins at your feet. You tilt a pot of water and watch it boil with nothing but the hum of a star. For the first time since the sirens, you smell tea.

Some days the world tests you with too much. A dust storm lifts and comes at the city like a new continent. You run the stairs, drop the greenhouse flap, weight it with bricks, all while the air learns to roar. Your tarp bellies and snaps. You cut strips from your sleeping bag to bind it. You abandon the feeling of later, of a colder night. The plants survive, bowed and stubborn. You thank them, out loud. It feels correct.

That night the radio returns your voice to you from elsewhere.

“—I heard your light,” a woman says. “I saw the fish.”

She arrives the next day from the east with a handcart and a sunburn. Her boots have stitched repairs. She carries three mason jars, two full of nails and one full of bees, and a duffel stuffed with ampersands: a hammer & a spool of fishing line & four good stories. You share tea and the last of the tinned peaches. “I used to be an accountant,” she admits. “Now I count clouds and rootlets.”

You offer her the ledger. She writes in it like someone laying stones across a stream. She draws a little bee in the corner of the page. You like her handwriting. You like the way she turns her face toward the sound of water.

Together, you change the station. You paint arrows on the tile with char and chalk: FOOD THIS WAY. WATER THIS WAY. You hang a curtain of bottle caps across the entrance that sings when anyone steps through. The bees learn the map of pillars and rails; their flight becomes the station’s punctuation. The two of you build shelves, tap lines for drip irrigation, and plant something that will take months to forgive you for the old world: tomatoes. It feels audacious, like whistling at a god.

Others come. A woman who used to be a nurse and now keeps time by the way she bandages. A boy who draws the old coastline from memory, insisting the ocean used to be closer because the wind still smells like salt there. A cook who can make six kinds of stew out of one kind of bean. A man who will never tell you his name but will sit the night shift by the radio and sing to static until it sings back. No one argues about the rules because you only have three: share, mend, and count the seeds out loud.

You put up a chalkboard. MONDAY: BEANS. TUESDAY: LEAVES. WEDNESDAY: SOUP WITH MUSIC. You invent holidays. The Day of First Blossom. The Festival of Working Faucet. On the longest day you give everyone a mirror and climb to the roof. At noon, you catch the sun and scatter it into the streets, a wheel of light turning slowly over the broken city. In the dark windows across the way you see faces catching gold. Some of them step forward. Some of them wave.

The radio grows crowded. Messages layer. Someone in the north wants to trade salt for seeds. Someone in the west says their apples remember sweetness. You begin adding coordinates to your broadcasts, then addresses, then recipes. You speak plainly: “If you’re hungry, come to where the fish swim up the wall. We have tea. Bring a cup if you can. If you can’t, come anyway.”

One evening, the man with no name turns in his chair and says, “Listen.” You hear it—a far rhythm under the static, like a heartbeat recorded through a wall. It’s the train, you think wildly, and for a moment your ribs fill with old timetables and morning commuters and the smell of wet wool and newsprint. But no. It’s smaller, closer. It’s the throb of many feet on stairs.

You stand beneath the bottle-cap curtain as it begins to sing. People—thin, uncertain, alive—come down into your orbit, blinking, led by mirrors, by rumor, by hunger, by the absolute ridiculousness of hope. Their pockets carry screws and spoons, seeds and stories. You make space. The bees accept the new air. Someone laughs, a short bright thing, and it echoes.

Later, much later, as the tea tin goes soft and the tomatoes lean heavy on their twine and the chalkboard reads THURSDAY: FRIENDS, you lie on your back on the still-warm concrete and stare up the stairwell where your stolen sunlight threads like a needle. You think: a dream could end here, on the cusp of a good thing, to spare itself disappointment. You could wake to the old ceiling, the ordinary morning, a bird arguing with its reflection in a window.

But the dream does not end. It breathes. It smells like basil and iodine and honey. Somewhere above, a mirror catches the last of the sun and sends it down to you as a coin, and you reach up and pocket it. You turn to the woman with the bees and say, “Tomorrow, we build shelves for the tomatoes. Tomorrow, we transmit a recipe for soup.”

“Tomorrow,” she agrees, and writes it on the ledger so you can learn it by heart.

The bottle caps clink. The radio purrs. The fish keep swimming. You fall asleep on a platform you chose, in a lighthouse you made, listening to the world arrive.
