In the throes of your dream, the weight of the impossible deadline presses down like a physical force. Your boss’s expectant gaze locks onto you, unwavering, as the air thickens with tension. You scramble to begin, but the project’s scope shifts unpredictably—spreadsheets morph into blueprints, then into cryptic puzzles. Your coworkers move in slow motion, oblivious to your urgency, or vanish entirely, leaving you alone in a sterile, fluorescent-lit void.  

A clock on the wall accelerates, its ticks morphing into a thunderous pulse. You fumble with tools that dissolve like sand, while your boss’s voice booms distorted demands. Just as despair crests, the dream twists: you discover a hidden door beneath your desk. Pushing through, you find yourself in a serene garden, the project now a single seed in your palm. Planting it, you watch it grow into something magnificent—effortless, inevitable.  

But as you reach to grasp the bloom, the scene fractures. You wake, heart pounding, the ghost of the deadline lingering—a haunting echo of pressure, yet softened by the fleeting taste of an unexpected escape.
