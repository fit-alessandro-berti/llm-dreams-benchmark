…you feel a storm approaching and at first you think it’s just the wind—just a shift in the trees—until you realize the forest has gone completely quiet.

No insects. No birds. Just you, and the soft crunch of your footsteps.

The light changes. Colors deepen, like someone turned up the contrast on the world. The moss on the ground is impossibly green, the bark on the trees almost black. You look up and see clouds rolling in, not gray, but a strange, shimmering violet, folding over each other like slow waves.

A low rumble rolls through the ground and into your bones.

You keep walking.

The path beneath your feet begins to blur at the edges, as if it’s unsure whether it wants to exist. One moment it’s a dirt trail. The next, it’s smooth stone. Then it’s nothing at all—just forest floor—and then it comes back. You don’t feel worried, exactly. It’s a dream, and a part of you knows it. You just accept that the path is having second thoughts.

The wind rises suddenly, with no warning. It smells like rain and something else—like old pages of a book, like static before a lightning strike. Leaves whip around you, but they don’t hit you. They spiral in a tight circle, forming a little whirlwind at your side, as if the forest is trying to get your attention.

You stop.

The whirlwind of leaves stops too, hovering in place, suspended in the air like it’s under glass. In the center of the spinning leaves, you see shapes flashing: a door, a hand, an eye, a clock face stuck at midnight, all flickering too quickly to focus on.

Another rumble. Closer.

The first raindrop hits your cheek, but it doesn’t feel wet. It feels warm, like someone touching your face with the tip of a finger. You look up, and the sky is opening.

Rain begins to fall, but it’s not normal rain. Each drop glows faintly, tiny lights falling from the violet clouds. When they land on the forest floor, they don’t soak in. They linger, pulsing softly before melting away. Every tree trunk they touch lights up with faint lines that look like writing in a language you almost recognize.

You realize the storm isn’t outside you. It’s around you.

The wind pushes you forward, not violently, just insistently, like a firm hand at your back. The path appears again, clearer now, as if the storm has drawn its edges. You follow it, because that’s all there is to do.

The trees gradually grow taller and closer together, their branches knitting into a canopy. The sky disappears, but the glowing rain remains, falling from nowhere now, drifting lazily through the air like slow-motion meteors. When a drop touches your arm, you see a memory: a quick flash of yourself at a window, much younger, watching a real storm, counting the seconds between lightning and thunder.

The memory fades as quickly as it came, leaving only a soft ache of recognition.

Ahead, there’s a clearing.

The path opens into a perfect circle, and in the center stands a single, massive tree, its trunk wide and smooth, its bark a deep silver-gray. Its branches are bare, yet the storm seems to swirl around it, anchored to it. Lightning twists itself gracefully around the trunk, never striking, just coiling like a curious snake.

You step into the clearing, and the storm pauses.

The wind dies. The glowing rain hangs midair, suspended. You feel every hair on your arms stand up. It’s as if the world is holding its breath.

A voice speaks, but not out loud. It arrives in your mind, like a thought you’re sure you didn’t think.

> “You’re late.”

You don’t see anyone. You look around, half expecting some cloaked figure or a guide of some kind, but there’s only the silver tree, the frozen storm, and you.

“Late for what?” you ask, and your voice sounds strange, slightly delayed, as if it had to travel from far away to reach your own ears.

The tree’s bark ripples, and a faint outline appears on its surface—a suggestion of a face, eyes and mouth sketched by shifting lines of light.

> “For your weather,” the voice says. “You’ve been walking in borrowed skies for a long time.”

You don’t understand, but in dreams that doesn’t matter much.

The suspended raindrops begin to fall again, very slowly now, like they’re thinking about each movement. Each one that touches you brings another flash: moments you were afraid and pretended not to be; promises you made to yourself and forgot; storms you walked through without ever looking up.

You realize the storm isn’t here to destroy anything.

It’s here to show you what you’ve been carrying.

Lightning curls down from the clouds and lightly touches the ground in a circle around the clearing, tracing a glowing ring. You stand inside it, the tree across from you. You feel a question forming, not in words but in weight:

*Do you want to keep going like this?*

You know exactly what “this” means, even though no one has defined it.

You look at the tree. The faint face in its bark is patient, almost kind.

“I don’t know how to change it,” you say.

The storm responds.

Wind rushes inward, tugging lightly at your clothes and hair, pulling something out of you—not your breath, not your strength, but something else: old fears, old stories, old sentences that start with “I always” and “I never.” They stream out of your chest and swirl into the air like smoke, like dark ribbons taken by the storm.

The glowing rain falls faster. Each drop that lands on you now feels cool and clean. You take a breath, and it’s easier than the last one.

The tree’s branches slowly fill with light, as if it’s blooming with tiny stars instead of leaves.

> “There,” the voice says. “Now the weather is yours again.”

The violet clouds thin, unraveling into streaks of soft gray, then pale blue. Sunlight filters through the branches, tentative at first, then bright. The glowing rain becomes ordinary rain mid-fall, clear and simple, soaking into the ground, into your skin. The writing on the trunks fades.

The storm passes as suddenly as it arrived.

The forest looks the same as before, but it doesn’t feel the same. The colors are softer. The path is solid now, just an ordinary path. The air is wet and fresh. Somewhere, a bird starts singing, like someone pressing play on the world again.

You glance back at the silver tree.

It looks ordinary now too. Just a tree in a forest. No face, no lightning, no storm swirling around it. But you know what it was, and what it did, and your chest feels strangely light, like you’ve set down a backpack you forgot you were wearing.

You take one more breath of the rain-washed air.

You blink—

—and you wake up, with the feeling that the storm is gone, but the weather it left behind is entirely your own.
