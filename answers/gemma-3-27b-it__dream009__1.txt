You wake up, and the first thing that hits you isn't disorientation, but *smell*. Woodsmoke, damp earth, something floral and sweet, and…animal. A lot of animal. You sit up, blinking against the filtered sunlight dappling through a canopy of leaves. Gone is your bedroom, replaced by a rough-hewn wooden floor and walls of wattle and daub. A thick, woven rug lies beside a low, wide hearth, cold now. 

Panic claws at your throat. One moment you were drifting off to sleep listening to a podcast, the next…this. You’re wearing clothes that feel strangely familiar, yet utterly foreign – a long, linen shift dress, cinched at the waist with a leather cord. 

You stumble to your feet, legs shaky. Peeking through a small, unglazed window, you see a village. Not a quaint, tourist-trap village, but a *real* one. Thatched roofs, chickens scratching in the dirt, people in similar, simple clothing going about their day. No cars, no electricity, no…anything modern. It’s like stepping into a history book. A very *real* history book.

As you explore the small, one-room dwelling, you realize it’s sparsely furnished. A wooden table, a couple of stools, a chest. Inside the chest, you find a few woven baskets, some dried herbs, and a small, worn leather-bound book. It’s written in a script you vaguely recognize as…Old English?

You venture outside, cautiously. The villagers eye you with curiosity, but not hostility. A woman carrying a basket of apples stops and asks, in a dialect that takes a moment to decipher, if you are well. You manage a shaky, “Yes, thank you,” and she offers you an apple. It tastes…intensely apple-y, somehow.

As you walk further into the village, observing, listening, the realization dawns. This isn’t just a different place, it’s a different *time*. Judging by the clothing, the architecture, the way people speak…you’d guess somewhere around the 14th century. 

And as you watch a farmer struggling to repair a broken plow, a blacksmith hammering at a glowing piece of metal, and a woman painstakingly spinning wool, you realize you need to… **learn to be useful. Quickly.**

You have no skills for this life. No knowledge of farming, weaving, blacksmithing, or even basic survival. You can operate a smartphone, write code, and order takeout, but those skills are utterly worthless here. You’re a liability, a stranger who doesn’t even know how to milk a cow. 

The woman who gave you the apple, whose name you learn is Elara, notices your bewildered expression. She smiles kindly. “Lost, are you, child?”

You nod, swallowing hard. “Very. I…I don’t know how to do anything.”

Elara’s smile doesn’t falter. “Everyone knows *something*. Come. I’m gathering herbs for healing. You can help me learn which ones are which. It’s a good place to start.”

And so, you follow her, the weight of your useless modern knowledge pressing down on you. You need to learn. You need to adapt. You need to become someone who can contribute, or you won’t survive. Your dream has become a desperate, urgent lesson in the art of living a life stripped bare, a life where survival depends not on technology, but on skill, community, and a willingness to learn from the earth itself.



The dream feels…heavy. And you have a sudden, overwhelming urge to learn the difference between chamomile and hemlock.
