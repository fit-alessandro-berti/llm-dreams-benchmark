Here's a continuation of the dream scenario:

You feel a storm approaching and the once-calm forest transforms around you. The trees begin to sway violently, their branches creaking and bending under the sudden fierce wind. Dark clouds roll in, blocking out the sunlight and casting everything in an ominous gray twilight. Lightning flashes in the distance, followed by a deep, rumbling thunder that seems to shake the very ground beneath your feet.

The air becomes charged with electricity, and you can feel your hair standing on end. Leaves and small branches swirl around you in a chaotic dance. Despite the growing intensity of the storm, you feel strangely calm, almost as if you're observing everything from a slight distance.

As the rain begins to fall - first in sparse, heavy drops, then in a torrential downpour - you notice something unusual. Between the trees, glimpses of a shadowy figure dart back and forth, always just at the edge of your vision. Is it watching you? Moving with you? The storm continues to rage, and the mystery of the forest deepens with each passing moment...
