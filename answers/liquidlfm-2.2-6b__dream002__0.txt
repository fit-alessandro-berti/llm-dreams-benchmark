The air shifts—once warm and still, now tense with electricity. The canopy darkens, molten with indigo hues, and thunder rumbles like distant drums. Rain starts to lash at you, cold and sharp against your skin. The ground trembles beneath your feet as leaves sparkle with lightning.  

Suddenly, you look up—not at the sky—but into the raindrop falling from above, suspended for a moment in motion, glowing faintly as if it holds a memory. Beneath it, you hear a voice, deep and ancient: *"The storm brings not destruction, but remembrance."*  

The rain slows, then stops. The world brightens—not with full sun, but with a soft, golden haze. You feel the weight of forgotten things rising around you: lost voices, midnight paths walked alone, the scent of rain-soaked earth after decades.  

And then, a fold of bark parts behind you, revealing a fairy ring glowing faintly in the light. From its center, a single sword of moss winds upward, unseen by the world above, but pulsing with life.  

You take a step forward—but the ground lifts, like a dream unraveling. The sword parts open, revealing a chamber bathed in bioluminescent moss. And there, standing before you, is a figure made of mist and starlight: your childhood self, but older, wiser, smiling.  

*"The storm shows you the way home,"* they say.  

Then silence. The forest returns to stillness—but you know now, the storm has changed you.
