You steady yourself and raise your voice over the thunder.

“Hold fast! Trim the sails—half canvas! Lash the starboard rigging!”

Your commands give the crew purpose. They rush into action, silhouettes darting through sheets of rain. You seize the wheel, feeling it buck beneath your hands as if the storm itself were trying to wrench control from you.

Another wave rises—towering, impossible. For a heartbeat, the world narrows to the wheel beneath your palms and the cold breath of the sea on your face.

It crashes over the bow, drenching you, but the ship climbs, climbs… and breaks through. Cheers erupt behind you, a burst of hope amid the chaos.

Your first mate steps beside you, eyes wide.
“Captain… what *is* that?”

The creature begins to rise.

And you…
