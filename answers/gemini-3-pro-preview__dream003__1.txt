...shimmering veins of iridescent blue that seem to pulse, as if the wood itself is alive and breathing. I trace a spiral groove with my fingertip, and the surface yields like warm wax.

Suddenly, the patterns detach themselves from the box, floating up into the air as glowing loops of light. They hum a low, resonant chord that vibrates in my chest. Without a hinge creaking or a latch sliding, the lid simply evaporates into a cloud of violet mist.

Inside, there is no velvet lining or gold coins. There is a tiny, perfectly formed thunderstorm raging in the corner of the box, no larger than a marble. Next to it sits a crumpled piece of paper that smells like a memory I can't quite place—perhaps the scent of rain on hot pavement from a childhood summer.

I reach out to touch the miniature lightning, but as my finger brushes the storm, the box expands rapidly, or perhaps I shrink. The edges of the box become the horizon, the violet mist becomes the night sky, and suddenly I am no longer holding the box; I am standing inside it, waiting for the storm to break.
