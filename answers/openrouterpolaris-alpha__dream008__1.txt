…look down and realize your keyboard has melted into the desk like black licorice.

“I’ll have this by noon,” your mouth says before your brain can object. Noon is in four minutes.

Your boss nods, but their face is…wrong. Their features slide around like magnets under paper, trying on expressions that don’t match the words: “We’re all counting on you.” Every “we” echoes, blossoming into other versions of them standing behind the first, a row of bosses, each holding a clipboard that’s actually a bathroom mirror that shows you from ten years ago, five years from now, never.

You try to type. Your fingers sink into the warm desk and pull out objects instead of letters:
- a stapler that won’t open
- your childhood house key
- a clock with no hands
- a small fish that blinks at you and whispers, “You’re late.”

“Where’s the brief?” you ask.

“It’s obvious,” says your boss, their voice coming from the ceiling vent. You look up; the vent is talking. The actual boss is frozen mid-blink.

Your screen wakes up on its own, flooding with windows:
- “FINAL_DRAFT_v73_THIS_ONE_FOR_REAL”
- “URGENT_REDO_IMMEDIATELY”
- “YOU SHOULD HAVE STARTED EARLIER”
- a video feed of you, sitting exactly where you are, looking more tired

All of the files open at once. The text wriggles like worms, rearranging into to-do lists that stretch off the page and coil onto the floor, paper snakes piling around your chair. Every bullet point begins with “MUST” and ends with something you don’t quite understand:
- “MUST ALIGN DELIVERABLES WITH THE WEATHER”
- “MUST RESOLVE ALL CHILDHOOD EXPECTATIONS”
- “MUST PRESENT RESULTS BEFORE CAUSE”

The office lights dim. The ticking of the wall clock grows deafening, then you realize it’s not the clock; it’s your boss tapping their pen, except their pen is now a metronome, swinging faster, faster.

You reach for your mouse, but it’s become your phone. It lights up:
New message from BOSS: “How’s it going?”
Elapsed time: 3 minutes. Remaining time: 2 days ago.

Panic flutters in your throat. “I don’t even know what the project is,” you say out loud.

All the copies of your boss turn their heads in eerie unison.

“It’s simple,” they chorus. “You just have to finish everything.”

The word “everything” dilates, the syllables stretching out like a siren. Your taskbar floods with icons—every abandoned idea, every unread article, every postponed promise, all demanding to be done now. The progress bar appears in the air above your desk, already at 0%, trembling.

Then your chair dissolves into sand, and you stand—no, you’re standing at the front of the office. Your desk has transformed into a podium. Your coworkers sit in tidy rows like an audience; some are versions of you. Your boss gestures for you to begin the presentation on the project you haven’t started yet.

“Go ahead,” they say, smiling too wide. “Walk us through your completed work.”

A clicker appears in your hand. The screen behind you flashes “FINAL RESULTS.” You turn to look, desperate, and instead of slides, it shows scenes from all the nights you stayed late, all the times you thought, “If I just push a little more.”

Everyone waits. The silence swells. Your throat closes.

Then a calm, unfamiliar voice from somewhere behind you says, “You know you can just wake up.”

The room pauses. The ticking stops.

Your boss tilts their head, glitching slightly. “We’re not done,” they say, but their voice is thinner now, like it’s coming through a wall.

You feel the weight of the clicker, the press of a hundred eyes. You notice the emergency exit sign glowing at the side of the room; it now reads “WAKE.”

You raise your hand, as if asking permission. “I quit,” you say, surprised at how steady you sound.

The bosses blur, their papers burst into a flurry of white birds, the monitors bloom into windows with actual daylight pouring through. The impossible deadline peels off the wall like a sticker and floats away.

Some small, stubborn part of the nightmare tries to follow you, whispering that you’re behind, you’re late, you’ll never catch up—but the exit door is bright and clear now.

You push it open.

You feel yourself falling gently upward, out of the office, out of the lists, into a cool, quiet space where there is no project, no clock—just your own slow, ordinary breathing.

And then:

You wake, with the faint memory of having refused something that always felt non-negotiable.

The anxiety lingers at the edges—but so does the fact that, even in the dream, you found the door.
