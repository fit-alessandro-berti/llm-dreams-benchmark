and each one seems stranger than the last.  

At first, the challenges are normal: a quiz on your skills, a mock interview, a group project. You breeze through these, feeling sharp and confident. But then the competition shifts.  

You're suddenly standing in a dense, misty forest. There's a narrow path, and a voice â€” maybe from the trees, maybe from nowhere â€” tells you that to move forward, you must find the "hidden truth" inside yourself. The contestants around you disappear into the fog one by one.  

You push forward, each step feeling heavier, the ground soft and uncertain. Strange symbols appear carved into the trees: words and images from your past â€” a favorite childhood book, an old failure, a forgotten ambition. You realize you have to piece them together like a puzzle, weaving them into a story that explains why you truly want this dream job.  

When you speak your story aloud, the fog lifts, and you find yourself standing in front of a massive door made of shimmering light. The final challenge. A figure â€” maybe your future self â€” steps out and says:  
*"Are you ready to live the life you've been dreaming of? Even if it means letting go of who you were?"*  

You nod. The door swings open â€” and you step through, into a brilliant new world.
