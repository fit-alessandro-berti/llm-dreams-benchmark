...the air grows heavy, thick with the scent of ozone and damp earth. The golden light filtering through the canopy vanishes, swallowed by bruised purple clouds that boil overhead. A low, guttural rumble rolls through the trees—not thunder, but something deeper, older, like the forest itself is groaning in warning.

You quicken your pace, boots sinking into suddenly sodden moss. Rain doesn't fall—it *slashes* sideways, icy needles stinging your skin. The path ahead dissolves into mist, and the familiar oaks and pines twist into impossible shapes, their branches clawing at the bruised sky.  

Then you see it: a single, gnarled elder tree ahead, its bark split like a wound, glowing faintly with an eerie silver light. At its base lies an object—a smooth river stone, impossibly dry, humming with warmth. As you reach for it, the storm *stops*. Not fades, but *stops*. The rain hangs suspended mid-air like glass beads. The wind freezes mid-howl. Even your own breath catches, trapped in your throat.  

From the hollow of the elder tree, two eyes open—amber and ancient, unblinking. They don’t belong to an animal. They’re the color of lightning-struck wood, and they hold the weight of every storm that ever was. A voice, not sound but vibration in your bones, echoes:  

*"You took the stone. Now carry the sky."*  

The suspended raindrops shatter inward, pulling you—not down, but *through*—into the tree’s hollow. Inside, there’s no wood, only stars. You’re falling upward, the stone burning in your palm, the storm now a cloak woven from thunder and twilight. And you realize: you weren’t fleeing the storm.  

You were its keeper.  

*(The dream ends as you wake with the taste of rain on your tongue and the stone’s warmth still pressed into your palm—though when you open your hand, it’s empty. Outside your window, the first real rain of the season begins to fall.)*
