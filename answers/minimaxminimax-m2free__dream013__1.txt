# The Spiral Labyrinth of Memory

You step out of the waking world into a corridor that spirals inward, walls etched with equations that hum like vowels. The floor tiles are faintly numbered and the ceiling blinks in constellations. Each turn summons a puzzle. Solve them to move deeper; the center lies at the end of a truth you will carry.

## Puzzle I: The Cardinal Dawn

On a stone archway is a small panel of three tiles. Above, a line of light slowly inches across them left to right. The arch murmurs:

“From where you came and where you are going,
Only one seat opens without showing.
Choose the leaf that stays the same,
When sunrise’s white lays down your name.”

- A left leaf lights red.
- A middle leaf lights white.
- A right leaf lights green.

The maze pauses, as if waiting for a single, safe answer.

Hint: The arch’s “sunrise’s white” and “seat” may mean a card (seat = “chair”) and a suit color (sunrise = white = “dawn”).

### What to choose?

If you think the card is the Ace of Spades (A-S), enter the cipher key code: ANCHOR. If you suspect Ace of Hearts (A-H), enter: OATH.

Confident it’s another card? Name it and I’ll check it.
