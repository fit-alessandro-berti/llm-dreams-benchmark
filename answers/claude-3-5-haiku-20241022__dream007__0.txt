Here's a possible continuation of the dream scenario:

...walk away to cool down and gain some perspective. As you turn to leave, the room seems to shift and blur around you. The walls become translucent, and suddenly you're standing on a bridge overlooking a misty landscape. Your friend is still there, but now their image is fragmented, half-transparent. You want to resolve the conflict, but you're not sure how to bridge the growing distance between you. The tension hangs in the air like fog, and you feel a mix of frustration and sadness.

Would you like me to elaborate on this dream scenario further?
