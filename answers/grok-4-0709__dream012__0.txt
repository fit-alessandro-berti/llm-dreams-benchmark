... steady yourself at the helm, gripping the wheel with hands that feel both iron-strong and strangely ethereal, like they're made of mist. The waves crash over the deck like furious giants, lightning splitting the sky into jagged shards of electric blue. Your crew— a ragtag bunch of faces that shift and blur, some familiar from childhood memories, others grotesque masks of forgotten fears— huddle around you, their eyes wide with a mix of terror and unwavering trust. "Captain!" one shouts, his voice warping in the wind like a distant echo, "What do we do?"

You open your mouth to bark orders— "Batten down the hatches! Secure the sails!"— but the words dissolve into a melody, a haunting sea shanty that rises unbidden from your throat. The storm seems to listen; the thunder rolls in rhythm, and suddenly, the ship isn't just wood and rope anymore. It begins to morph, its mast sprouting leaves like a great oak tree, the hull curving into the shape of a colossal whale's back. The turbulent sea calms for a heartbeat, revealing glimpses of underwater cities glowing with bioluminescent lights, where mermaids with your grandmother's face wave you onward.

But the peace is fleeting. A massive wave rears up, a wall of water with eyes— piercing, judgmental eyes that whisper your deepest regrets: "You abandoned the safe harbor... you chose the storm..." Your heart pounds as you steer into it, not away, because in this dream, you know the only way out is through. The crew cheers, their forms flickering like candle flames, and as the ship plunges into the wave's maw, everything inverts— sky becomes sea, up becomes down.

You emerge on the other side, not in water, but floating through a starry void, your ship now a vessel of pure light. The storm is behind you, a distant rumble, and ahead lies an island of floating clocks, where time unwinds like yarn. You laugh, the sound echoing infinitely, and whisper to your crew, "We were never lost. We were just dreaming."

And then, as dreams do, the edges blur. You feel a gentle tug, like waking, but you resist, steering onward into the unknown. What happens next? Well, that's for you to dream...
