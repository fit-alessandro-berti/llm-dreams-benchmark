You feel a storm approaching and the air grows heavy, thick with the scent of rain and ozone. The leaves above you begin to rustle with increasing urgency, their gentle whisper transforming into a rushing chorus. A flash of distant lightning illuminates the forest canopy in stark white, and moments later, a low rumble rolls through the trees like a warning.

You quicken your pace, searching for shelter. The first fat drops of rain begin to fall, hitting the broad leaves around you with a percussion of small drums. The peaceful green light of the forest darkens to deep emerald as the clouds swallow the sun.

Up ahead, you spot an old wooden structure—a weathered ranger's cabin, partially reclaimed by moss and vines. You break into a run as the storm truly arrives, rain now falling in sheets, soaking through your clothes. You reach the cabin's small porch just as thunder cracks directly overhead, making the wooden beams vibrate beneath your hands.

You push open the door and step inside. The cabin is dusty but dry, with a stone fireplace and a few pieces of furniture draped in white cloth. Through the single window, you watch the storm rage against the forest—the trees bending and swaying, lightning streaking across the sky in brilliant forks.

As suddenly as it arrived, the storm begins to quiet. The rain softens to a gentle patter on the roof. Through the clearing mist, you notice something strange: a faint path leading deeper into the woods, marked by small glowing mushrooms that only appear when the rain touches them...

Would you like to continue following the path?
