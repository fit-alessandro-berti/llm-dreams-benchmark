...accept their offer with a mix of relief and curiosity. As you walk together, the city around you begins to shift—buildings stretch and twist like living things, and the streets glow with an otherworldly light. The strangers reveal they are not ordinary people but guides from a hidden realm, sent to help you uncover a forgotten part of yourself.

They lead you to a quiet courtyard where a single, ancient tree stands. Its roots pulse with energy, and its branches whisper secrets in the wind. One of the guides hands you a small, glowing key and says, *"This will open the door to what you’ve been searching for."* You turn to see a door carved into the trunk of the tree, its surface covered in symbols that seem to rearrange themselves as you watch.

With a deep breath, you insert the key. The door creaks open, revealing a path bathed in golden light. As you step through, you realize this is not just a place—it’s a memory, a truth, or perhaps a future waiting to unfold. The voices of the guides fade behind you, but their kindness lingers like a promise: *"You were never truly lost. You were just finding your way home."*

And then—you wake up, the dream lingering like a half-remembered song, leaving you with a sense of wonder and the faintest echo of the tree’s whisper in your heart.

Would you like to explore what lies beyond the door? Or perhaps uncover the meaning of the symbols?
