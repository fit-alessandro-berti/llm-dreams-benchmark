Okay, I'm dreaming... here we go.

You are walking through a peaceful forest, sunlight dappling through the leaves, painting shifting patterns on the mossy ground. Birdsong is your constant companion, a melody both cheerful and soothing. The air is still, carrying the scent of damp earth and pine needles. You feel a deep sense of calm, a quiet joy in the simple act of placing one foot in front of the other.

Then, the air shifts. It grows heavy, and the sweet scent of the forest is replaced with the metallic tang of ozone. The birds fall silent, their cheerful songs replaced by an unnerving hush. The leaves begin to rustle, not with a gentle breeze, but with a frantic, nervous energy. You feel a storm approaching and...

...a low rumble vibrates through the ground, traveling up your legs like a warning tremor. The dappled sunlight is abruptly extinguished as thick, bruise-colored clouds race across the sky, swallowing the sun whole. The temperature plummets, and a sudden, chilling wind whips through the trees, causing their branches to groan and twist. You feel a strange pull, like the air itself is trying to drag you towards the heart of the storm.

Lightning flashes, illuminating the forest in stark, theatrical strokes of white. For a split second, you see the trees distorted, monstrous shapes against the backdrop of the sky. The thunder cracks a moment later, so loud that it feels like your chest is vibrating. It’s not the normal roll of thunder, this is a sharp, almost angry sound, like a giant snapping his fingers.

You instinctively seek shelter, spotting a small cave opening in the side of a moss-covered hill. You dash towards it, branches lashing at your clothes, but just as you reach the entrance, the rain hits, a deluge that soaks you through in seconds. It's not just rain, though. It's cold, heavy, and feels almost...magnetic. You watch, mesmerized, as the rain appears to dance and swirl, pulled in different directions by unseen forces.

As you step inside the cave, you notice that the darkness isn’t as complete as you expected. A faint, pulsating light emanates from the depths, a mesmerizing swirl of blues and greens. It draws you in, a compelling invitation despite the storm raging outside. Hesitantly, you move deeper into the cave, the storm’s roar fading into a dull hum, replaced by a low, rhythmic thrum that resonates deep within your bones.

You reach a chamber where the pulsating light originates. It’s not fire, not anything you’ve seen before. It’s a swirling vortex of color, suspended in mid-air, and within it, you can glimpse fragmented images: faces you don't know, landscapes that shift and change, and fleeting moments of joy and sorrow. You feel an irresistible urge to touch it, to understand what this strange, beautiful phenomenon is. You reach out your hand and...

...And that's where the dream fades. The colours become swirling static, the thrumming fades into a dull hum, and the images blur into nothingness. You are left with the lingering feeling of anticipation, the unresolved question of what would have happened if you had reached the light. You stir, half awake, the storm still echoing in the remnants of your dream. The forest, the storm, the pulsating vortex – all now distant memories, yet strangely vivid in the morning light.
