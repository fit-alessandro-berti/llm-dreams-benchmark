feel a wave of anxiety wash over you as you stare at the towering stack of papers on your desk. The office around you begins to blur, the fluorescent lights flickering erratically. You take a deep breath and reach for the first document, but as your fingers brush the page, it dissolves into a swarm of tiny, buzzing bees. Startled, you stumble backward, knocking over your chair. The bees swarm around you, their hum growing louder until it drowns out your boss’s impatient tapping foot. 
Suddenly, the floor beneath you cracks open, and you fall into a vast, starry void. Instead of panic, a strange calm settles over you as you float among the constellations. Your boss’s voice echoes faintly, “The deadline’s tomorrow!” but it feels distant, irrelevant. Below, you see a shimmering river winding through the darkness, and you drift toward it. As you land gently on its banks, the river transforms into a glowing timeline, with deadlines and tasks flowing past like fish. 
You spot your impossible project bobbing along the current, and with a flick of your hand, you stretch the timeline, giving yourself weeks instead of hours. The bees reappear, but now they’re carrying tiny pens and laptops, buzzing cheerfully as they help you work. Your boss materializes beside you, but instead of glaring, he’s sipping coffee and nodding approvingly. “Nice workaround,” he says, and the dream fades as you type furiously, the starry sky twinkling above you.
