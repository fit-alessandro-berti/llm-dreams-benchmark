You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns etched into the wood – swirling celestial maps, ancient runes, and symbols that seem to shift and writhe like living things in the dim light. They aren’t just decoration; they pulse faintly, syncopating with a slow, rhythmic humming that seems to emanate from *inside* the box itself.  

Then, without thinking, you *touch* it—your fingertip lingering on one of the patterns. As soon as your skin makes contact, the box doesn’t open, but the humming swells, becoming a low keening sound. The patterns inside begin to glow, not flicker, but *pulse*, revealing a hidden image: a view inside yourself, flickering like a memory, but not quite... *yours*. It shows you standing at the edge of a vast, fractured mirror, each shard reflecting a different version of you—some happy, some haunted, some you never dared to imagine.

Then the image shatters, and the box trembles. The humming stops. A single word materializes, etched in glowing runes across the lid:  

**“Trust.”**

And with that, the box creaks… but doesn’t open. Instead, a tendril of light extends from the wooden walls and wraps around your wrist.
