*blink*

I look down at my hands and they seem... wrong. Too many fingers? No, now they're normal. The fluorescent lights hum with a sound like distant bees.

My boss is waiting. Their face keeps shifting—sometimes it's every authority figure I've ever known layered on top of each other, sometimes it's just a smooth oval with the *impression* of features.

I open my mouth to say \I'll get started right away\ comes out is a flock of small origami birds made of spreadsheet paper. They flutter toward the ceiling.

No one seems to notice.

I sit down at my desk, but the computer keyboard has symbols I've never seen—ancient and glowing faintly. My fingers know what to do anyway. I'm typing furiously, and the screen fills with... something. It looks like the project, complete, but also like a window into a vast library that extends forever.

The deadline was impossible, but I realize with dream-logic certainty that **time isn't moving the same way here.**

My boss nods approvingly, their face now my own face, and says: *\ always knew how to do this. You just forgot.\*

I wake up—or do I?—and my alarm is ringing, but the sound is made of colors...

*What happens next in the dream?*
