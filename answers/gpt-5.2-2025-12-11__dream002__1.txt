…you feel a storm approaching and the air goes strangely still, like the whole forest is holding its breath. The light dims, not like sunset, but like someone has lowered a curtain over the sky. Leaves stop rustling. Even your footsteps sound too loud.

A low roll of thunder moves through the trees, and with it comes a smell—rain, sharp pine sap, and something metallic, like old coins. The first drop hits your forehead, cold as river stone. Then another. Then a handful more, fat and heavy, tapping your shoulders and the back of your neck.

You look up, expecting black clouds, but what you see isn’t clouds at all. It’s movement: a slow, spiraling ceiling of mist rotating above the canopy, as if the sky is being stirred.

Wind arrives all at once. It pushes at your chest, threads through your hair, tugs at your sleeves like an impatient hand. Branches sway, but they don’t creak—they whisper. Not words exactly. More like the sensation of being called by name without anyone speaking.

Ahead, the path you were following splits into three. You don’t remember it ever splitting before. The left trail is slick with fresh rain and glints with tiny puddles. The middle trail is carpeted with needles so dry they look untouched by weather. The right trail is dark, almost blue, and you can’t quite see where it goes because the trees there lean inward as if listening.

Lightning flashes—silent, white, and too slow—and for a moment the forest is lit like a photograph. In that frozen brightness you notice something: on the trunk of the nearest tree, a door. Not carved, not painted—an actual door, narrow and tall, with a tarnished brass handle and water beading on its surface as if it has always belonged here.

Thunder finally cracks, close enough that you feel it in your teeth. The door handle trembles.

Without deciding to, you step toward it. Your boots sink slightly into the moss, and the air thickens, damp and electric. The closer you get, the more the storm seems to focus on that one point, like everything—wind, rain, sound—has been arranged to push you here.

You wrap your fingers around the handle.

It’s warm.

When you turn it, the storm pauses. Not stops—pauses, like a song held on a single note. The door opens onto a space that shouldn’t fit inside a tree: a long hallway lit by lanterns that sway even though there’s no breeze. The walls are made of living bark, threaded with faint veins of light, and the floor is smooth as river-worn wood.

You take one step in. The rain sound shifts, becoming distant, like it’s happening in another dream entirely.

The door swings shut behind you with a gentle click.

For a moment you stand there, listening. The lanterns give off a honey-colored glow, and the air smells of cedar and something older—paper, dust, and dried herbs. Far down the hall, someone is humming a melody you almost recognize.

Then you see it: on a table to your right sits a small glass jar filled with stormwater. A label is tied around the neck with string, and the ink on it looks freshly written.

It says: **“For when you forget.”**

Beside the jar is a book, opened to a page covered in maps of the forest—but the paths aren’t drawn as lines. They’re drawn as memories: a crooked line labeled *the day you ran away*, a loop labeled *the place you promised you’d return to*, a dot labeled *the word you couldn’t say*.

Your throat tightens with a feeling you can’t name. You reach toward the jar, and in its surface the storm outside reflects, but not the forest. It shows a different sky—one with unfamiliar constellations, turning slowly as if searching for something.

The humming stops.

From the far end of the hallway, a voice calls softly, neither threatening nor kind—simply certain.

“Ah,” it says, as if you are expected. “You arrived just in time. The storm has been looking for you.”

The lanterns sway harder now, their shadows stretching long and thin. The bark-walls pulse with a dim light, like a heartbeat.

And somewhere beyond the hallway—beneath it, above it, inside the wood itself—you feel a door you haven’t opened yet, waiting with patient inevitability.

You lift the jar of stormwater.

Outside, the thunder resumes.

Inside, the forest holds its breath again.

And you begin walking toward the voice, carrying the storm with you, trying to remember what it is you came here to find.
