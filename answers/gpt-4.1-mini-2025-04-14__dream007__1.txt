You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to take a deep breath and suggest that you both step away for a moment to cool down. As you walk apart, the tension starts to ease a little. You realize that beneath the anger, what you both really want is the same: understanding and respect. When you come back together, you listen carefully to their point of view and share your own more calmly. Slowly, the walls you built between you begin to dissolve, and you find a way forward together, stronger than before.
