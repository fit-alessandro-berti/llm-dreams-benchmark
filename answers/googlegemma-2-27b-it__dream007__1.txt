... walk away. 

The words, sharp and stinging like wasps, were still buzzing in my ears as I stormed out of the cafe. My breath hitched, catching in my throat like a lump of sourdough gone wrong.

Rain lashed against the windows as I walked down the street, but I wasn't noticing. My friend Sarah's words, "Maybe we want different things from life," echoed in the chambers of my mind normally reserved for planning elaborate baking adventures with her. But not today. Not when the argument left me feeling like a moldy piece of bread – dense, sour, and completely misunderstood.

The frustration simmered inside me. We were friends since childhood, baking buddies with a lifetime of shared oven mitts and sugar spills. But since Sarah had moved across the country and started her fast-paced career, something had shifted.  We rarely found time to bake together anymore. Our lives, once perfectly aligned over buttery croissants and sticky fingers, were now separated by flour-dusted phone calls, filled with apologies for cancellations and fleeting moments of joy seeing each other during infrequent visits.

Our shared passion for flour and frosting had become... a point of contention.

"You always cancel our baking dates," Sarah had said, exasperated. "Don't you want to bake anymore?"

My getaway was as impulsive as the raw anger I felt. Bake?  

Of course I wanted to bake. But baking? It's not a battlefield, not a race against deadlines. How could she not see the joy it brought *me* to finally bake with her, even if it wasn't under the relaxed, joyous atmosphere of our usual Saturday afternoons?

The last few months, since leaving behind our aprons to pursue full-time positions across the country, had only widened the chasm between us.

*Ceasefire. Now.*

I stopped mid-stride, letting the rain dampen my face, wondering why our lives had to become so dissimilar. My rant died in my throat, the smell of coffee and cinnamon morphing into the metallic tang of raindrops and city fumes.

"We're just. So. Different. Now," I muttered, a wry remembrance of our disagreement....

Sarah, with her laptop open, meticulously stirring her latte art, sighed, the sound echoing the storm brewing within me.

"Different can be good," she said, pausing between each word, carefully placing her mug on the table before me. "But I want to make sure we're on the same page.

Are you sure you want to give up on us? Just because our methodologies changed?"

The rain's fury subsided Slightly; I see a new light in the corner of Sarah's fire escape-turned-workstation. A flicker of hope.

"It's not about the methods, Sarah," I said, trying to let some anger drip away with the rain falling on the hot asphalt below.

"This *doesn't* feel like a good way to spend a Saturday," she'd said, resigned frustration in her voice, "working, I mean.

I sighed again and flipped open the notebook I was always carrying, its pages filled with plans for sourdough experiments. "That's the only part I disagreed with,” I said. “"The bustling city lights are beautiful, that’s for sure, but I wouldn't say no to a peaceful baking session with Donuts with Sprinkles instead of these incessant storms of stress."

She pulls back the train of the game... smiles sadly and says,

“Different can be good?!” Sarah scoffed, "But Jesse, this time, it’s different. It's not just a different frosting.

It's a different world.”

Sarah, soaked

with a wistful expression, sat across

my notebook, her face illuminated by the laptop screen perched precariously on our tiny table displaying her intricate latte art masterpiece.

She smiled across. 

“By the way, how about you don’t call it ‘Donuts with Sprinkles’, and just...geez, it's tailored to my punctuality-challenged nature. But maybe it's not about the ingredients, but the final product.

Maybe it's not


Our crumpled words remain unspoken.

And let the angsty silence 
be punctuated by the clatter of spoons against the metal of your takeaway cup.

“by the way, you just  won the raffle at the bakery..."

This imagined scene would become a turning point in the story, a new development that threw the candy-coated sweetness of our friendship into question.

What would Sarah think?

Would she burst into tears, crumbling amidst the pressures

of the city? 

Would she abandon the promise of tasty retirement

goals? 

We are both standing there, different worlds, slightly

overlapping.

Would she "settle" for a coffee and cookie date?

"Would we", I asked, taking a slow sip. "Have a socially distanced walk in moonlit streets while

contemplating our future? A queer cafe, devoid of

judgment?

“If I’m going to grade these things
