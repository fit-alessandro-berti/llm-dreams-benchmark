**Dream Continuation:**

As you trace the sinuous grooves of the patterns with your fingertips, the carvings begin to pulse with a faint, ethereal glow. The metallic surface hums beneath your touch, as though awakened. Suddenly, the lines rearrange themselves like living veins of light, coiling into constellations you *almost* recognize—a star map, a language of shapes from a forgotten time. The box shudders, and with a sound like a whispered secret, its lid cracks open. 

A prismatic light spills out, flooding the room with fleeting images: a childhood home you’d nearly forgotten, a stranger’s laughter that stills your pulse, a door ajar in a sunlit corridor you’ve never walked. The box is empty, save for a mirror at its base. As you peer in, your reflection shifts—younger, older, braver, fractured—until it settles into a version of yourself you’ve never seen but *know* is true. 

A voice, neither kind nor unkind, echoes: *“The key was never lost. You grew around it.”* The mirror dissolves into starlight. The world tilts, and you’re falling upward—or is it inward?—before the dream fractures into dawn. 

You wake with the taste of honey and iron on your tongue, and a question you can’t quite grasp, glowing faintly at the edge of memory.
