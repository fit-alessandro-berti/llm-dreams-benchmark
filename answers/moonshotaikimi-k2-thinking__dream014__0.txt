...notice their faces shimmer like heat mirages, yet their voices anchor you. One, with eyes like old streetlights, hands you a folded map drawn on tissue paper. But when you open it, instead of streets, you see the inside of your own chest—ribcage avenues, heartbeat intersections.

They lead you through an alley that wasn't there before. The walls breathe with moss and murmured conversations in languages you almost understand. A woman with a laugh like wind chimes points upward, and you realize the city has no sky—only layers of other cities stacked upside-down, people walking on ceilings of glass.

"You're not lost," says a child who flickers like a candle, "you're just at the center of all the places you've ever been." They form a circle around you, and each touch leaves a glowing print on your skin—constellations of fingerprints mapping routes you recognize from dreams you've forgotten.

The strangest part: as they guide you, the city's noise resolves into music. The traffic becomes a rhythm section, the chatter a choir. You understand now that the city isn't a place to escape from but a living archive of arrivals. Your final destination, they whisper, is the subway station that appears only when you stop looking for it—a platform where every train leads to the same next moment, and you are always exactly on time.

You wake with the tissue paper map still in your pocket, now blank except for one fading phrase: "Welcome home to yourself."
