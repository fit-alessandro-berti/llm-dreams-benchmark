try to blend in, feeling both curious and slightly out of place. The room is alive with chatter, laughter, and the clinking of glasses. You weave through clusters of people, catching snippets of conversations that range from deep philosophical debates to lighthearted jokes about old TV shows.

As you pass one group, someone suddenly calls your name—not your real name, but a nickname you haven’t heard in years. It startles you, and you turn to see who it could be. A stranger smiles warmly at you, as if they’ve known you forever. “There you are!” they say, pulling you into their circle. They seem so certain, so familiar, that you don’t correct them or ask how they know you. Instead, you play along, intrigued by this unexpected twist.

The group welcomes you effortlessly, sharing stories as though you’re an integral part of their history. One person recounts a wild adventure involving a road trip across deserts and mountains, while another talks about a recent discovery—a hidden café downtown where time seems to slow down. Each story feels vivid, like fragments of memories you almost recognize but can’t quite claim as your own.

While listening, you catch sight of the person you originally came to find. They’re on the other side of the room, deep in conversation with someone else.

These strangers feel oddly comforting, as if being here with them is exactly where you’re meant to be right now.

Then, just as you begin to relax into the rhythm of the gathering, the lights flicker. Everyone pauses mid-sentence, looking up in unison. The hum of voices fades, replaced by an eerie silence. When the lights stabilize, the scene shifts subtly—you notice small details changing around you: the color of the walls, the arrangement of furniture, even the clothes some people are wearing. It’s as though reality has wobbled for a second, resetting itself.

A woman nearby whispers, “Did anyone else feel that?” Her words break the spell, and the noise resumes, louder than before. But now there’s an undercurrent of unease. People glance at each other nervously, laughing too hard or speaking too quickly, trying to shake off the strange moment.

You step away from the group, suddenly aware of a pull toward the door. Something—or someone—is waiting outside. As you move through the crowd, you realize the faces around you are becoming less distinct, more blurred, as if the dream itself is unraveling. By the time you reach the exit, the room behind you dissolves entirely, leaving only darkness and the cool night air.

Outside, the world stretches endlessly, filled with possibilities. And then…
