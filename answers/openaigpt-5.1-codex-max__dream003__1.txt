geometric glyphs etched into its surface, almost as if the box itself is telling you a story. The more you look, the more the lines seem to move, shifting like a kaleidoscope into shapes you think you recognize from old fairy tales and half-remembered maps.

Your fingertips trace a spiral and you feel a slight warmth. A soft hum fills the air, and the patterns begin to glow in soft blues and golds, illuminating the room with an otherworldly light. You realize the designs aren’t random at all; they’re a kind of lock of their own. When you press a certain sequence of symbols, the box shivers, and there’s a faint click you feel more than hear.

The lid lifts slowly, as if rising on a breath, and inside there is no treasure, no trinket, but a small pool of clear water. When you look down into it you don’t see your reflection. Instead you see scenes flickering like the surface of a lake in sunshine: a towering forest of silver trees, a city floating on clouds, faces you’ve never met smiling as if they know you.

A distant voice whispers your name, but when you turn, the room melts away. You’re standing at the edge of that silver forest now, the box in your hands, its patterns still glowing, inviting you to take the next step.
