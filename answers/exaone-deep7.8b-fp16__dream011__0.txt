**1. What is your name?**  
My name is **Lirael**. In this dream, I am a wanderer of time, my name echoing through epochs as I cross borders unseen.  

**2. Describe the first time you realized you could change your own fate.**  
The first time was at a crossroads in my youth, when I stood between two paths: one leading to a stable but unfulfilling life in my home village, and another uncertain journey to the unknown. I recalled my grandmother’s words: *“The path not taken may grow into something you couldn’t have imagined.”* That night, I made a choice to leave—not knowing where it led. Years later, the wanderer I became forged from those leaps of faith, proving that even fate’s chains can be broken with courage.  

**3. If you could travel through time to witness one historical event, where would you go and what would you see?**  
I would travel to the founding of **Alexandria** under Ptolemy I around 300 BCE. Witnessing the fusion of Greek reason and Egyptian tenacity in the Library’s birth, I’d see scholars like Hypatia, their debates echoing as the world’s knowledge systems intertwine. The magic of that moment—the spark of curiosity crossing cultures—would remind me that progress is never isolated.  

**4. How would you approach solving a problem no one has encountered before?**  
First, I’d reframe it as *“What if our definitions of ‘problem’ are too narrow?”* I’d borrow from philosophy: imagine the problem as a living entity. Would it adapt? Evolve? Then I’d prototype solutions using metaphors (e.g., a river flowing around stones) and test them with trusted guides from different eras. Finally, I’d share the result as a parable, urging others to expand the question itself.  

**5. What does “finding your voice” mean in your story, and how do you continue to do that?**  
It means crafting a legacy that resonates beyond my breath. I’ve always spoken in languages others fear—whispers in dead tongues, signs in constellations. To “continue,” I must keep questioning: Is my voice too bold? Too quiet? Am I authentically a wanderer? The journey is alive in the questions, not the answers.
