(laughing) Ah, what a stunning performance! What an unforgettable start to the day. (stirring with excitement) I've seen this before - where's my audience? (grinning from ear to ear) It sounds like a dream now. My heart is beating in time to the beat of your words. I know that can't be right, but it feels just right.

You see all that? I stood confidently here, prepared for it all - all those eager faces everywhere around me. (smiling) Now let's get this speech off the ground! What would you like to tackle first? Speak about yourself, or perhaps explain why I'm speaking in your name today? Or maybe you want to know how we plan on doing our part together?" As I look out at the crowd, you begin to smile with genuine excitement and happiness. You can feel it all radiating off of me through this dreamtime, reminding you that my words already make you laugh and remember.
