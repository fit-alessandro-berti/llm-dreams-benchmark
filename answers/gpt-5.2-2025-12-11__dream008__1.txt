You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel your hands hovering over the keyboard like they belong to someone else—close enough to obey, too far away to move.

The screen wakes up before you do.

A new folder is already on your desktop: **FINAL_FINAL_v8_REAL**. You don’t remember creating it. Inside is a single file labeled **START_HERE**. When you click it, a blank document opens, except for one line in the middle of the page:

**WRITE THE PROJECT TO FINISH THE PROJECT.**

Behind you, the office breathes—fluorescent lights pulsing like a slow heartbeat. The hum of printers becomes ocean-sound, the kind you hear inside a shell. Your boss stands at your cubicle wall, not leaning, not blinking, holding a mug that says *TEAMWORK* but the letters are rearranged every time you glance at it.

“Go on,” they say, smiling the way a loading icon smiles.

You type the first sentence you can think of—something sensible, something you’d write when you have no idea what you’re writing.

As soon as the period lands, the office shifts.

The timeline in the corner of your screen fills itself in. Charts appear. A polished slide deck assembles like a flock of birds, each bullet point snapping into place with a soft click. The impossible deadline in your calendar changes from **TODAY, 5:00 PM** to **DUE: WHEN YOU BELIEVE IT**.

You stop typing. The deck freezes mid-flight, a few slides still translucent, like ghosts waiting to be named.

Your boss’s smile thins. “Don’t stop.”

You try again. You type: **The client wants the moon, but we’re going to give them something better.** You don’t know what that means, but the slide that appears is gorgeous—deep blues, clean typography, a moonlit graphic that looks like it’s humming. You can practically hear applause in the walls.

Each sentence you write becomes a deliverable. Paragraphs turn into code. Metaphors become marketing copy. A vague idea becomes a fully costed plan with margins and contingency. It’s thrilling for about seven seconds.

Then you notice the footnotes.

Every slide contains a citation. Every citation is your own name.

Your boss’s mug now says *TIMEWORK*. The letters settle like teeth.

“How am I doing this?” you ask, and your voice comes out in the same tone as the office printer.

“You’re finally producing,” your boss says. “Like we always knew you could.”

You look around for someone—anyone—who might be in on the joke. The other desks are occupied, but everyone is facing away, shoulders rigid, typing in perfect unison. Their screens reflect in the glass partition: the same blank document, the same single line, the same command.

**WRITE THE PROJECT TO FINISH THE PROJECT.**

The air gets colder, like the office has decided it’s winter. The clock on the wall ticks too loudly, and then not at all. The second hand is gone. The minute hand drifts, uncertain, like it’s reconsidering.

You backspace a sentence.

Instantly, something disappears from the room.

The water cooler evaporates, leaving a dry outline on the carpet. A plant turns to dust. A colleague’s laughter—something you didn’t even realize was there—cuts off mid-note. Nobody reacts. Nobody turns around. It’s as if reality is being compiled from your text and garbage-collected when you delete.

You stop touching the keys.

Your boss leans closer. Their face doesn’t blur exactly, but it becomes… under-specified. Like a person someone described to you once and you never bothered to picture fully.

“Deadlines,” they say softly, “are the only thing that makes people real.”

On the monitor, your cursor blinks, patient and hungry.

You try a different approach. You type carefully:

**This project cannot be completed under these conditions. We need more time.**

A new slide appears, titled **RISKS & MITIGATIONS**. Under *Risks*, it lists: *Burnout. Errors. Resentment.* Under *Mitigations*, it lists: *Increase output. Reduce sleep. Normalize urgency.*

You feel something tighten behind your ribs, like a knot being pulled.

You type faster, panicking now, testing the edges of the dream like a tongue probing a chipped tooth.

**We delegate. We ask for help. We push back.**

The office fills with more people—too many. They materialize at empty desks, standing in hallways, sitting on the floor with laptops balanced on their knees. They all look vaguely like you, but not exactly. Different hair, different posture, different exhaustion.

They all start typing.

Their keys make the sound of rain.

Your boss watches you with an expression that might be pride or hunger. “See?” they whisper. “You were never alone. You were just underutilized.”

The impossible deadline remains, glowing in your calendar like an ember. **TODAY, 5:00 PM.**

You glance at the time in the corner of your screen.

**4:59 PM.**

You feel the dream’s pressure increase, like the walls are inching closer. Your hands begin typing on their own, words pouring out in an unstoppable stream. The document becomes a river. The slide deck finishes assembling. A final email drafts itself, addressed to the client, polite and triumphant.

Your boss’s mug now reads: *YOU DID IT*.

A notification pops up:

**SUBMIT?**

Your finger hovers over the trackpad. If you click yes, the project goes out. The dream might end. But you also suspect something else will happen—that the office will spawn another folder, another impossible deadline, another blank page demanding your life in exchange for completion.

You don’t want to click yes. You don’t want to click no. You want to wake up.

So you write one last sentence, as deliberately as you can, like placing a key into a lock.

**This is a dream, and I am allowed to leave.**

The office stutters.

The fluorescent lights flicker, and for the first time, everyone turns toward you at once. Dozens of faces, all variations of your own, staring with identical fear—as if you’ve said the one phrase that makes the whole system unstable.

Your boss’s smile breaks. “You can’t just—”

You keep typing, breath shallow, eyes burning.

**The deadline is a lie. The boss is a placeholder. The project is a trap.**

The carpet ripples like water. The cubicle walls sag and peel back like cardboard. The company logo on the far wall droops, the letters sliding off as if gravity has changed its mind.

The “SUBMIT?” notification shakes, blurs, tries to re-form.

Your boss reaches for your shoulder, but their hand passes through you like warm fog.

You type the final line with the certainty of someone stepping off a ledge they’ve been standing on for years:

**I wake up now.**

The screen goes white.

The hum stops.

The rain of typing ends.

And in the sudden silence, you feel yourself lifting—out of the chair, out of the office, out of the idea that you must earn your right to exist by finishing something impossible.

Your eyes open.

You’re in bed, heart racing, the room dim and still. Your phone screen glows on the nightstand with a notification you don’t remember setting:

**REMINDER: Be kind to yourself today.**

You reach for it, half afraid it will show **TODAY, 5:00 PM**, half expecting your boss’s name.

It’s just the time.

Just the quiet.

Just you.

And for a moment, before the day rushes in, you lie there feeling the soft relief of not having to type the world into place.
