You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to adapt quickly. The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth, and the cobbled streets are crowded with people in rough-spun tunics and leather aprons. A blacksmith’s hammer clangs in the distance, and chickens scatter as you step into the muddy square. Your heart races—**where are you, and how will you survive?**

A burly man with a soot-streaked face notices your confusion. “Stranger,” he calls out, “you look as lost as a lamb in a wolf’s den. Name’s Elias. This here’s Ravensbridge, 12th century, if that explains the… *simplicity*.” He gestures to his forge, where a fire licks at a half-formed horseshoe. “No gadgets here, just iron and sweat. The village elder might have answers for you, but mind the roads—bandits and wild boars don’t take kindly to outsiders.” 

As Elias hands you a rusted dagger for protection, you notice a faded tapestry in his workshop depicting a comet streaking across the night sky. “Sighted three nights past,” he mutters. “Folks say it’s an omen. Change… or calamity.” 

Suddenly, a shout echoes from the alehouse. A farmer bursts in, breathless: “The miller’s boy fell into the old well—it’s collapsed!” The villagers turn to you, desperation in their eyes. Without modern tools, how will you free him? Your mind races: *levers, pulleys, ropes…* Could Elias’s forge supplies help? 

**Choice:** Do you (A) rally the villagers to build a makeshift winch, using the blacksmith’s tools and horse ropes, or (B) squeeze into the unstable shaft yourself, risking a cave-in to reach the boy?  

Either way, your actions ripple through Ravensbridge. If you succeed, the elder invites you to a clandestine meeting about the comet—and whispers of other “drifters” like you. If you fail, suspicion hardens against you, and the dagger Elias gave you becomes more necessity than gift.  

But as the stars emerge, you glimpse the comet’s tail—an eerie mirror of the tapestry. Is it a key? A countdown? And why does the well’s depth feel *impossible*, as if it pierces through time itself…?  

The dream lingers here, leaving you to wonder: Is this the past, a parallel world, or a test? And what will you sacrifice to return home—or to stay?
