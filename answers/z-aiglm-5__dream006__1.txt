The spotlight hits you like a physical weight, warm and blinding. For a moment, the faces blur into an indistinct mass of shadows and expectation. Your mouth feels stuffed with cotton. The microphone stands before you, silent and waiting.

You open your mouth to speak, but—

The words have evaporated. Every carefully prepared sentence, every practiced gesture, gone. Your hands find the edges of the podium, gripping tight. The wood grain presses into your palms, anchor points in the sudden vertigo.

A single cough echoes somewhere in the darkness beyond the front row.

Then something shifts. Not in the audience, but within you. A strange calm that doesn't belong to waking life settles over your shoulders like a mantle. The pressure in your chest releases.

"I forgot what I was going to say," you hear yourself announce. The admission rings honest and strange across the vast space.

A murmur ripples through the crowd. You expect laughter, derision. Instead, heads tilt forward. Someone in the third row leans in, genuinely curious. They're waiting for what comes next.

So are you.

The dream logic takes hold—the microphone becomes a branch, then a torch, then simply a microphone again. The audience's faces shift between strangers and people you've known. Your mother's eyes watch from the left side. A childhood friend sits center row. The rest remain beautifully, mysteriously anonymous.

You lean into the uncertainty.
