...plant a garden.

You clear a small circle of ash near the ribcage of a fallen skyscraper, your hands trembling not from fear, but from anticipation. From a pocket in your tattered coat, you produce a single, sealed packet of sunflower seeds—an artifact from the Before. 

As you bury them and pour your precious water ration onto the dry earth, the logic of the dream takes hold. Vines shoot up instantly, glowing with a soft, bioluminescent pulse. The flowers open with the sound of chiming bells, and their pollen drifts on the wind, turning the grey snow into vibrant green grass wherever it lands. 

You sit back, watching the wasteland breathe again. The dangers—the raiders, the beasts, the radiation—fade into the background, muted by the vibrant, impossible color of life returning to the bone-dry world. You realize then that you aren't scavenging to survive; you are creating a reason to.
