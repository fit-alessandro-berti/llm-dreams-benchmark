**Dream Continuation:**

The moment the strangers step forward, the city around you seems to *shift*—not in a way that’s obvious, but like the air itself has thickened, carrying the weight of something unseen. Their faces are warm, their voices gentle, but there’s an unspoken understanding between them, as if they’ve been waiting for *you*.

One of them—a woman with silver-streaked hair tied in a loose braid—holds out a hand. "You’re not lost," she says, not in a dismissive way, but as if she’s already known this. "The city doesn’t *hide* you. It just… *tests* you." She gestures toward the towering skyscrapers, the neon signs flickering like dying stars. "Some doors are meant to be opened, others closed. But you’re not supposed to walk alone."

A man beside her—tall, with a quiet strength in his posture—takes your arm. "We’ve been here before," he murmurs. "Not as strangers, but as echoes of the people who came before you." His eyes flicker with something like nostalgia, like he’s remembering a time when the city felt different.

Then, the crowd parts. Not by force, but as if the city itself is holding its breath. A narrow alleyway opens before you, lined with flickering lanterns that cast long shadows. The air smells of rain and old books. At the end of the alley, a door stands slightly ajar—wooden, weathered, but not broken. The woman smiles. "That’s where you’re going."

But before you can step through, the man’s voice cuts through the silence: *"Wait."* He turns to the others, his expression serious. "She’s not just lost. She’s *chosen*." The crowd murmurs in agreement. A child—no older than eight—clutches the woman’s sleeve. "I know her name," the child says, voice trembling. "She’s the one who left the library last week."

The woman’s smile falters. "The one who…" She trails off, her gaze flickering toward the door. The child nods. "The one who took the book about the bridges."

The door creaks open wider. Inside, the light is dimmer, but the air is warm, filled with the scent of ink and something older—like the hum of a city that remembers. And then, you see it: a map, spread out on a table, its edges frayed with time. The streets you’ve walked are marked in red, but there’s a single path in blue, winding toward a place no one has ever named.

The woman reaches out, her fingers brushing yours. "You’re not lost," she repeats. "You’re *home*."

And as you step through the door, the city fades behind you—not as a place you left, but as a story you’re becoming. The lanterns glow brighter. The child’s voice echoes in your mind: *"Find the bridges."*

---
**What do you do next?**
- Follow the blue path on the map, drawn to a hidden bridge where time moves differently.
- Ask the strangers why they’ve been waiting for you—what do they know that you don’t?
- Notice the red lines on the map and wonder: *Why are they there?*
- Or… something else entirely. (The dream is yours to shape!)
