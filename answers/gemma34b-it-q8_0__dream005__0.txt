Okay, here we go - a dream continuing…

“You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter a kaleidoscope of unfamiliar, vibrant groupings—a table overflowing with ornate porcelain cups clinking softly, attracting a cluster of intense discussions about the proper angle to hold a teaware. Nearby, three young men, radiating youthful confidence, were arguing vehemently about the mechanics of a miniature, intricately-painted wooden sailboat. 


You push past them, hoping for a clearer path, and navigate through a group of elderly women dressed in flowing silk scarves, murmuring to a woman clutching a giant silver compact mirror - listening, not speaking, their eyes fixed intensely. Around them, a young man in a bright yellow scarf was patiently translating a complicated opera aria into slightly broken Mandarin, completely absorbed in the endeavor. 

Just when you're starting to sweat with anxiety – acutely aware of being the *only* one out of step – you stumble into a room entirely populated by creatures that seem pulled straight from folklore. There’s a regal-looking troll examining a pile of amethyst geckos, a satinist sprite applying iridescent glitter to a rather grumpy badger, and a dwarf polishing a gleaming, miniature cannon.  

As you sidle past a conversation regarding the correct temperature to brew dandelion tea (apparently, 57.6 degrees Celsius), a figure appears from the shadows - *the person you came to find*. It’s a woman draped in a long violet waistcoat, wearing a ridiculously flamboyant feather brooch and carrying a single, perfectly ripe fig. She holds out her hand, palm up, a gentle smile gridding across her lips.



"It took you long enough," she murmured - her voice surprisingly dry. "The marmalade’s almost finished. We’ve been baking it for the last three years." 


And then, abruptly, the music swells – a waltz performed by a collection of shadow puppets dancing on a massive tapestry— and everything sharpens out of focus…" 


… and I drift.

How do you like the development?  Do you want me to continue the dream, or do you want to suggest a twist or direction for where it goes next?
