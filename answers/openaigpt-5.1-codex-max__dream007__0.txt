…settle it the way you used to settle everything when you were kids: by finding out who could reach the top of the old oak tree first.

Before either of you can move, the room melts into green and you are suddenly at the base of a tree so tall its branches disappear into a sky that shimmers like water. Your friend is already climbing, laughing, and you feel your anger tighten and then loosen into a competitive grin. You grab the bark, but it is soft like bread, and your hands sink in. You hoist yourself up anyway. The higher you go, the more the tree twists into a spiral staircase, into a ladder made of your shared photographs, into a rope of braided voices arguing, apologizing, laughing.

Halfway up, you glance down. The ground is not there anymore, only a whirl of leaves and phrases you can't quite remember. Your friend looks down at you and his face is yours. He says, "Why are we fighting?" and his voice echoes from every branch.

You decide to stop climbing. You let go. You fall, but the falling feels like floating. The anger is gone, replaced by a strange lightness. As you drift down through the canopy, the leaves become pages, and the pages become feathers. You land in a clearing. In the center is the thing you were arguing about — not an object, but a small, glowing knot of light pulsing like a heartbeat. When you reach out to touch it, it turns to mist and rises, dissipating into the morning.

A warmth spreads through your chest, and as the clearing fades, you wake up with your hand outstretched, your heart still beating fast, the argument suddenly absurd and distant, like a conversation you had in another life.
