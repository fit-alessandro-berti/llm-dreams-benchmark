strange and not what you expected. They seem more like puzzles or riddles rather than straightforward questions from the syllabus. You feel a mix of confusion and anxiety but try to stay calm.

You read the first question: "If a chicken and a half lays an egg and a half in a day and a half, how many eggs does one chicken lay in one day?" You remember this is a classic rate problem, but you blank on how to set it up. You decide to break it down step by step.

First, you think about the basic formula for rates: rate times time equals work done, or in this case, eggs laid. So, rate × time = eggs. But here, you have multiple chickens and fractions involved, which complicates things.

You try to find the rate for one chicken. If a chicken and a half lays an egg and a half in a day and a half, you can write that as 1.5 chickens lay 1.5 eggs in 1.5 days. You need to find out how many eggs one chicken lays in one day.

Maybe you can find the rate per chicken per day. Let's denote the rate as R (eggs per chicken per day). So, the total eggs laid would be R times the number of chickens times the number of days.

So, eggs = R × chickens × days.

Given that 1.5 chickens lay 1.5 eggs in 1.5 days, you can plug in these values:

1.5 = R × 1.5 × 1.5.

Now, solve for R:

R = 1.5 / (1.5 × 1.5) = 1.5 / 2.25 = 0.666... eggs per chicken per day.

Wait, that seems off. You remember that in these types of problems, the rates should simplify neatly. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me try thinking in terms of proportions. If 1.5 chickens lay 1.5 eggs in 1.5 days, then perhaps halving the number of chickens would halve the number of eggs, assuming the time remains the same.

So, if 0.75 chickens lay 0.75 eggs in 1.5 days, then scaling up or down might help.

Alternatively, maybe I should find the rate per chicken per day directly. If 1.5 chickens lay 1.5 eggs in 1.5 days, then one chicken would lay fewer eggs.

Let me see: if you have 1.5 chickens laying 1.5 eggs in 1.5 days, then one chicken would lay 1.5 / 1.5 = 1 egg in 1.5 days.

So, one chicken lays 1 egg every 1.5 days. Therefore, in one day, it would lay 1 / 1.5 = 2/3 eggs.

That matches what I got earlier, 0.666... eggs per day. So, the answer should be 2/3 eggs per day.

But the problem is probably expecting a fraction, so 2/3 is fine.

You write down "2/3" for the first question.

Moving on to the next question: "A rope cuts through a block of cheese in such a way that it makes exactly six pieces with three straight cuts. How is this possible?"

You recall that with each cut, you can potentially maximize the number of pieces by cutting through existing pieces in a way that intersects all previous cuts.

You start thinking about how many pieces you can get with each cut.

With no cuts, you have one piece: the whole block of cheese.

With the first cut, you can divide the block into two pieces.

With the second cut, if you slice through both existing pieces, you can get four pieces.

Now, with the third cut, if you slice through all four pieces in a way that intersects the previous two cuts, you should be able to get eight pieces.

Wait, but the question says exactly six pieces. How is that possible if the maximum number of pieces with three cuts is eight?

Maybe there's a way to make fewer than eight pieces with three cuts.

Perhaps if some of the cuts are parallel or don't intersect in a way that maximizes the number of pieces.

Let me think about it differently.

If all three cuts are parallel, then you would only divide the cheese into four pieces, not six.

If two cuts are parallel and the third is perpendicular to them, you would get six pieces.

Yes, that seems promising.

So, imagine the cheese is a rectangular block.

Make the first two cuts parallel to each other, say horizontally, dividing the cheese into three layers.

Then make the third cut vertically, perpendicular to the first two cuts. This would slice through all three layers, resulting in six pieces.

Alternatively, you could make the first cut vertically, splitting the cheese into two halves.

Then make the second cut horizontally, dividing each half into two, resulting in four pieces.

Finally, make the third cut parallel to the first one, slicing through two of the four pieces, resulting in six pieces.

Either way, it seems possible to get six pieces with three cuts.

You write down a description of this method for the second question.

The next question is: "You have two identical eggs and a 100-story building. What is the minimal number of drops required to find the highest floor from which an egg will not break when dropped, in the worst case scenario?"

This seems like a classic optimization problem, often referred to as the "egg dropping problem." You need to find the critical floor with the fewest number of drops, considering that you have only two eggs and want to minimize the worst-case scenario.

You know that if you had only one egg, you would have to drop it from each floor starting from the first up to the 100th, which could take up to 100 drops in the worst case. That's not efficient at all.

But with two eggs, you can be smarter about it. You can use the first egg to narrow down the range of possible floors, and then use the second egg to pinpoint the exact floor once the range is small enough.

One common approach is to use equal intervals. For example, drop the first egg from every 10th floor: 10, 20, 30, etc.

If the first egg breaks on the 30th floor, you then take the second egg and drop it from floors 21 through 29, one by one, to find the exact floor.

In this case, the maximum number of drops would be 10 (if the egg breaks on the 100th floor) plus 9 (dropping the second egg from floors 91 to 99), totaling 19 drops.

But maybe there's a better way to minimize the number of drops.

You recall that the optimal strategy involves making the number of drops as consistent as possible, regardless of where the critical floor is.

Suppose you drop the first egg from floor X. If it breaks, you need to check floors 1 through X-1 with the second egg, which would take up to X-1 drops.

If it doesn't break, you move up by Y floors and drop it again.

You need to choose X, Y, etc., in such a way that the maximum number of drops is minimized.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a formula or a standard solution for this problem.

You remember that for two eggs and N floors, the minimal number of drops in the worst case is equal to the smallest integer K such that the sum of the first K integers is at least N.

In other words, K(K+1)/2  N.

So, for N=100, you need to find the smallest K where K(K+1)/2  100.

Let's calculate:

For K=14, 14*15/2 = 105, which is greater than 100.

For K=13, 13*14/2 = 91, which is less than 100.

So, K=14 is the minimal number of drops in the worst case.

But wait, that seems too high. Maybe you're misremembering the formula.

Alternatively, you recall that the optimal strategy involves step sizes that decrease by one each time.

For example, start by dropping the first egg from floor 14.

If it breaks, drop the second egg from floors 1 through 13, which could take up to 13 drops.

If it doesn't break, go up by 13 floors to floor 27 (14+13=27), and drop again.

If it breaks here, use the second egg to check floors 15 through 26, which could take up to 12 drops.

Continue this pattern, decreasing the step size by one each time.

So, the sequence of drops would be:

14, 27 (14+13), 39 (27+12), 50 (39+11), 60 (50+10), 69 (60+9), 77 (69+8), 84 (77+7), 90 (84+6), 95 (90+5), 99 (95+4), 100 (99+1).

In this scheme, the maximum number of drops is 14, which matches your earlier calculation.

But you're not sure if this is indeed the minimal worst-case number.

Maybe there's a better strategy.

Alternatively, perhaps you can model this as a dynamic programming problem.

Let D be the minimal number of drops needed for N floors and K eggs.

The recurrence relation would be:

D(N, K) = 1 + min over F from 1 to N of max(D(F-1, K-1), D(N-F, K))

Where F is the floor you choose to drop the first egg from.

This looks complicated to compute by hand for N=100 and K=2.

Given time constraints, maybe you should accept that 14 is the minimal number of drops in the worst case.

You write down your reasoning and conclusion for the third question.

The next question is: "What is the units digit of 7 raised to the power of 2023?"

This seems like a problem involving exponents and understanding patterns in the units digits of powers.

To find the units digit of 7^2023, you need to look for a pattern in the units digits of the powers of 7.

Let's calculate the first few powers of 7 and observe their units digits:

7^1 = 7 (units digit is 7)

7^2 = 49 (units digit is 9)

7^3 = 343 (units digit is 3)

7^4 = 2401 (units digit is 1)

7^5 = 16807 (units digit is 7)

7^6 = 117649 (units digit is 9)

You can see that the units digits repeat every 4 powers: 7, 9, 3, 1, and then back to 7, 9, 3, 1, and so on.

This is a cyclic pattern with a cycle length of 4.

Therefore, to find the units digit of 7^2023, you need to determine where 2023 falls in this 4-digit cycle.

You can do this by finding the remainder when 2023 is divided by 4.

Calculate 2023 ÷ 4:

4 * 505 = 2020

2023 - 2020 = 3

So, 2023  3 mod 4.

This means that 7^2023 has the same units digit as 7^3.

From earlier, 7^3 has a units digit of 3.

Therefore, the units digit of 7^2023 is 3.

You write down this reasoning and conclusion for the fourth question.

The final question is: "In a room, there are three people: Alice, Bob, and Carol. One of them is a knight who always tells the truth, one is a knave who always lies, and one is a spy who can either lie or tell the truth. You can ask only one question to one person to determine who is who. What question do you ask, and to whom?"

This is a classic logic puzzle involving knights, knaves, and spies.

You need to ask a single question to one of them to figure out the identity of all three.

This is tricky because the spy can behave like either a knight or a knave, which adds an extra layer of complexity.

First, recall that in standard knight and knave puzzles, where there are only knights and knaves, you can ask a question about what another person would say to distinguish between them.

But here, with the addition of a spy who can act like either, the problem becomes more complex.

You need to find a question that can give you enough information to deduce all three identities despite the spy's flexibility.

One approach is to ask a question that forces the person you're asking to relay information about another person in a way that exposes their true nature.

Let's consider asking one of them a question about what another would say.

For example, you could ask Alice: "If I were to ask Bob who the spy is, what would he say?"

But this might not be sufficient because the spy can



 perhaps it's better to ask a question about how another person would respond to a specific statement.

Wait, maybe I should consider asking about the relationships between their identities in a way that the spy's flexibility is accounted for.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to ask a question that can only be truthfully answered by one role.

Alternatively, perhaps I can ask a question that forces the person to commit to certain statements about the others.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I ask Alice: "Is Bob the spy?"

If Alice is the knight, she always tells the truth, so her answer reflects the actual status of Bob.

If Alice is the knave, she always lies, so her answer is the opposite of Bob being the spy.

If Alice is the spy, she can answer either way.

This doesn't seem immediately helpful because the spy's response is unpredictable.

Maybe I need to ask a more complex question that incorporates the possibilities for all three.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider asking about the number of knights, knaves, or spies.

For example, I could ask Alice: "Are you the knight?"

If she says yes, she could be the knight or the spy pretending to be a knight.

If she says no, she could be the knave or the spy pretending to be a knave.

This doesn't distinguish between them sufficiently.

Maybe I need to ask a question about the number of knights or knaves.

Wait, perhaps I can ask Alice: "If I were to ask you if Bob is the spy, would you say yes?"

This is a double negation if she's a knave.

But again, the spy can answer either way.

This seems too convoluted.

Maybe there's a better approach.

I recall that in standard knight and knave puzzles, asking about what another would say can be useful. Maybe I can adapt that here.

Let me try this:

Ask Alice: "If I were to ask you who the spy is, would you tell me Bob?"

This way, if Alice is the knight, she would truthfully answer whether she would identify Bob as the spy.

If Alice is the knave, she would lie about whether she would identify Bob as the spy.

If Alice is the spy, she can answer either way.

Hmm, still not ideal.

Wait, maybe I should ask a question that involves all three roles.

Perhaps I can ask Alice: "Is Bob the knight or the knave?"

If Alice is the knight, she'll truthfully say whether Bob is the knight or the knave.

If Alice is the knave, she'll lie about Bob's role.

If Alice is the spy, she can answer either way.

This still doesn't give me enough information to distinguish all three.

This is difficult.

Perhaps I need to accept that one question might not be sufficient, but according to the problem, it is.

Wait, maybe I should consider asking a question that forces the person to make a statement about themselves and another person.

For example, ask Alice: "Are you the knight and is Bob the knave?"

If Alice says yes, then:

- If she's the knight, then both statements are true: she is the knight and Bob is the knave, so Carol is the spy.

- If she's the knave, she's lying, so either she's not the knight or Bob isn't the knave. But since knaves lie, it's possible combinations.

- If she's the spy, she can say yes or no arbitrarily.

This seems messy.

Alternatively, maybe I can ask a question about the number of knights or knaves.

For example, ask Alice: "How many knights are there among you?"

If she says one, which is the actual number, then:

- If she's the knight, it's true.

- If she's the knave, she's lying, so there would be more or less than one knight, but we know there's exactly one knight.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because there is exactly one knight.

So if the knave says "one," it's a lie, meaning the number isn't one, but it is one, so she wouldn't say that.

Wait, no. If the knave says "one," that's a lie, meaning the number of knights isn't one, but in reality, it is one, so the knave wouldn't say "one."

Similarly, if the spy says "one," it could be truthful or lying.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps I should accept that with these constraints, it's not possible to determine all three identities with certainty from a single question.

But the problem states that you can determine who is who with one question, so there must be a way.

Let me try a different approach.

Suppose I ask Alice: "If I were to ask you whether you are the spy, would you say yes?"

- If Alice is the knight, she would truthfully say whether she is the spy. Since she isn't, she'd say no.

- If Alice is the knave, she would lie about whether she is the spy. Since she isn't, she'd say yes.

- If Alice is the spy, she can say either yes or no.

So, if Alice says no, she's either the knight or the spy.

If she says yes, she's either the knave or the spy.

This still doesn't resolve the spy's identity.

Hmm.

Perhaps I should ask a question about Bob and Carol.

For example, ask Alice: "Is exactly one of you two (you and Bob) the spy?"

- If Alice is the knight, she'll truthfully answer whether exactly one of them is the spy.

- If Alice is the knave, she'll
