You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panic—your palms are slick, your breath comes in short gasps. The city towers above you in impossible layers: bridges of glass connect buildings that spiral into the clouds, while below, narrow alleys pulse with the hum of hidden machinery. No street signs, no familiar landmarks—just shifting façades that seem to warp when you look away.

You check your pockets and find a small brass pocket watch. It’s ticking backward.

A stranger in a long coat made of folded maps passes you, glancing over their shoulder. “Third left after the clock that weeps,” they murmur before merging into the crowd. You follow, desperate, but the crowd thickens into a living current, carrying you like driftwood. The sky darkens—not with night, but with floating inkblots that blot out patches of sun.

Then you see it: a clock embedded in the side of a building, its face cracked, tears of liquid silver streaming down the brick. You take the third left. The street narrows into a corridor of whispering hedges. At the end stands a door—plain, wooden, marked only with the number **∞**.

You knock. The door swings open before your knuckles touch it.

Inside isn’t a room but a library suspended in starlight. Books float gently, their pages rustling like wings. In the center sits a woman—or perhaps a statue—with your own face, reading a book titled *“Your Next Move.”* She looks up. Her eyes are calm.

“You’re right on time,” she says. “The meeting was with you all along.”

You wake up with the watch still warm in your hand—and the faint scent of old paper on your breath.
