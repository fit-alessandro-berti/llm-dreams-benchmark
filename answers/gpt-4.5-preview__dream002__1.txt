the sky darkens rapidly above, filling with heavy, swirling clouds. A powerful wind rushes through the trees, rustling the leaves violently, and casting eerie shadows on the forest floor. Thunder rumbles in the distance, and lightning flashes, illuminating the woods in brief bursts. You feel an instinct to seek shelter, and hurry toward a distant glow you spot between the trees.

As you approach, you realize it is a cozy cottage, hidden among the trees. Warm light spills from its windows, a comforting contrast against the swirling winds. You rush to the wooden door and gently push it open. Stepping inside, you're greeted by a calming warmth and the gentle fragrance of herbal tea brewing. The storm fades to a muffled hum outside, and you notice a friendly presence sitting at the table, smiling gently and welcomingly, as if they've been waiting for you. They offer you a seat and gently whisper, "We've been expecting you."

How does your dream continue from here?
