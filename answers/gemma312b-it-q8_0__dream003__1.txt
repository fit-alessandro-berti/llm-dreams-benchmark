You are dreaming. You are looking at a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate panels covered in swirling, almost hypnotic patterns, like galaxies contained within a wooden shell. They aren't carved in the conventional way, but seem to ripple subtly beneath the surface – as if observing a living organism, frozen in time. The light catches the wood in unusual ways, causing ephemeral shadows to dance across these flowing patterns.

A voice echoes, not from a person present, but from the box itself. A mellow drone at first, then resolving into hesitant words that feel ancient and borrowed.  "*... resonance… touch…”* 

Intrigued and a little alarmed, you hesitantly reach out and trace a single swirl on one side. Immediately the room shifts. You’ve apparently been standing in what looked like a cluttered, forgotten museum. Now the walls recede to reveal an endless stretch of twilight sky painted with impossible hues: turquoise mingling with rose, emerald chasing ochre. The sky isn’t static, but constantly undergoing a shifting, beautiful decay, like a photograph melting.

The box feels *right* in your hand – warm, familiar, as if you’ve held it before across a very, very long time. Now, the patterns begin to illuminate. No longer just shifting shapes, but miniature landscapes playing out on each panel. You see ancient cities collapsing into dust, forests blooming overnight, colossal creatures swimming in oceans of liquid obsidian.  

A new instruction, more forceful, comes from the voice. "*Remember… the song… the heart… follow…*" 

 Suddenly, *you* start to remember. Fragmented feelings surge back: the joy of running wild as a child; the profound sadness of loss; fierce, protective love. And underlying all of those memories, is *laughter* – the pure, unfiltered echo of unbridled happiness.

Then you notice symbols emerging from the landscape inside the box. They aren't letters you know, but somehow they *are* recognizable: a spiraling serpent, an intertwined root system, and, centered amidst them, a pulsating red crystal shaped like a heart. Focusing on this final image brings with it an overwhelming certainty: it's *your* heart, but magnified tenfold, brimming with forgotten vitality.

The box begins to hum, the sound escalating. The landscapes on its sides race – life and death compressed into blurs of vivid colour and agonizing sorrow.  As you grip the pulsing light, a voice, clear and distinct, whispers the final clue, “Look *within* your memory, dearest One. What song held the first light of joy? Sing it. *Feel* it anew…" 



And the sensation washes over you, strong as tidal force - warmth spreading through your limbs, a burst of golden sunlight, remembering, *knowing*, something essential… And with it, a feeling like falling, and a faint scent of cinnamon. 



You are awakening... just as you sing the first few notes of a childish melody.



...The lock clicks open.
