You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realized you had an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You started to panic, a cold knot tightening in your chest. Buildings towered, crafted with impossible angles - chrome twisting around gargoyle mosaics, bioluminescent vines crawling across obsidian walls.  Every sign was written in swirling glyphs you instinctively knew you couldn't decipher. 

My internal clock screamed, a relentless beat driving sharper anxiety higher. I darted forward into a bustling plaza, dodging people with shimmering skin, robotic street vendors, creatures seemingly made of smoke and stardust. They didn’s seem to notice my disorientation, just flowed around me like water. Everywhere was sensory overload – a cascade of metallic hums, bubbling laughter in a language unknown, scents both enticing (roasted spice) and disgusting (something musky and decaying - best to ignore that). 

“An hour!” I yelled out loud, more to myself than anyone else. A tiny, fluffy, three-legged creature with violet eyes tilted its head at me, emitting a chirping sound suspiciously like muffled laughter. Wonderful. 

Driven by sheer desperation, I started questioning everyone I could reach. "Excuse me!" ...Silence. "Do you, by chance, happen to know… the Lumina Sanctum? I need to find the Lumina Sanctum!"

Each response was just shrugs, bewildered expressions, and often, a shower of shimmering motes ejected from their very bodies. They looked *pitying*. 

Then, I spotted it: a kiosk built entirely of living, pulsing coral radiating a gentle green light. Behind it stood... well, it wasn’t really a *person*. It resembled a shimmering obsidian mask perpetually hovering above a swirl of colored smoke instead of a human body. 

“Informant for transactional navigational assistance,” boomed a voice echoing from the mask, devoid of personal intonation . 

Taking a shaky breath, I stampered towards it, feeling my last shred of composure fraying at the edges. "Lumina... the Lumina Sanctumb. I-I’m meeting someone, quite urgently.”

In response, several intricate, shifting patterns appeared on a glowing panel beside the kiosk, morphing continuously. "The acquisition price," said the smoky voice, "is a memory." 

My stomach churn fell. Memory? "I… I need to be there. It's incredibly imporant."




The smoky form shimmered and rippled. This memory will be… pleasant, one you'll readily relinquish." I felt pulled—a faint ache originating from within my own mind. "A sunset over the crystalline sea you spent that afternoon with…" I saw a flash in the swirling lights – an enormous, pink sandbeach stretching forever, shimmering under an alien double moon. The memory - *my* memory -- drifted just out of reach, like grasping for fog. The pull became more insistent, enticing. And so, slowly, reluctantly...
