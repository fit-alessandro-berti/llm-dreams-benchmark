You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are...

...not questions at all, but intricate, hand-drawn illustrations of impossible machines made of clockwork, feathers, and fog. Each diagram is labeled with a single, unrelated word – "Whisper," "Cobalt," "Root," "Laughter." You pick up your pen, but it feels strangely light. Looking down, you see it's not a pen but a perfectly formed, bright red cardinal feather.

Panic begins to bubble as you scan the page. The student to your left is busily sculpting their answers out of modeling clay that smells faintly of cinnamon. The proctor, who has eyes that slowly rotate like tiny galaxies, is carefully watering the potted plants on the desks with a tea kettle.

You try to focus on "Whisper," the word next to a drawing of a giant, intricate ear carved from a cloud. What are you supposed to do? Write? Draw? Whisper back? You lean closer, and the illustration seems to shift slightly, the lines breathing. You can almost hear a faint, indecipherable sound coming from the paper.

Then you notice that the paper itself isn't paper. It's thin, cold ice that is slowly melting under the warmth of the room. A puddle is forming, blurring the edges of "Cobalt" and "Root." You desperately try to use the feather to push the water away, but it's useless. The future, your future, is literally dissolving before your eyes, and all you have is a bird's feather and the scent of cinnamon from your neighbor's clay. You feel a rising tide of impossibility and profound, quiet dread.
