You sit in a dimly lit room, the air thick with the scent of old paper and dust. The walls are lined with cracked mirrors, each reflecting a different version of yourself—some smiling, some weeping, some staring back with empty eyes. The table before you is carved from a dark, gnarled wood, its edges bleeding faintly. A single lamp flickers, casting jagged shadows that dance like wolves across the floor.  

The exam paper is blank, but your hand is steady as you pick up a pencil. The questions appear as though they’ve been written by a hand you’ve never seen, but you recognize them instantly:  

1. *What is the color of the first star you’ll forget?*  
2. *If you could trade your left eye for the memories of a stranger, would you?*  
3. *Name a truth that unravels when you speak it aloud.*  
4. *Describe the sound of a silence that cannot be heard.*  
5. *What is the shape of the question you’re asking yourself right now?*  

You feel the weight of the questions, not in your chest, but in your throat—a hollow, gnawing ache. The teacher, a figure you’ve never seen but somehow know, appears at the door. They’re wearing a robe that shifts between colors, their face a blur of emotions. “The answers are not in the paper,” they say, their voice echoing from multiple points in the room. “They’re in the *spaces* between the words.”  

As you struggle to answer, the room begins to change. The mirrors reflect not your face, but fragments of your past—your childhood, your failures, your dreams. The pencil you’re holding turns into a blade, then a feather, then a key. The clock on the wall ticks backward. You realize the exam is not a test of knowledge, but of *truth*: the truth of your fears, your regrets, your unspoken desires.  

You try to write, but your hand moves of its own accord, scrawling answers that aren’t yours. The teacher smiles, and the mirrors begin to show you a future you’ve never imagined: a life of quiet solitude, a career that consumes you, a name you’ve never chosen.  

When the final question appears, it’s written in blood. *“What do you want to be when you grow up?”*  

You sit there, the pencil in your hand, the room humming with a low, familiar sound. You don’t know if you’ve failed, or if you’ve been chosen. The lamp flickers one last time, and the room falls silent.  

You wake up, still sitting in bed, the exam paper still in your hands. But the questions are gone, replaced by a single line in your notebook: *“The answer is the question you didn’t ask.”*
