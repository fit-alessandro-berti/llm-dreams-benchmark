You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and **the air thickens, becoming heavy and electric. The leaves on the trees, moments ago a vibrant green, begin to twist and contort, taking on a bruised purple hue. A low, guttural rumble vibrates through the ground, resonating in my chest. The birds, which were singing a moment ago, fall silent, disappearing completely from view. The wind whips up, not a gentle breeze, but a howling, predatory force that tears at my clothes and whips my hair across my face. The sunlight, previously dappling through the canopy in golden streaks, is swallowed by an ominous, churning blackness that seems to be descending from the sky. I look up, and for a fleeting instant, I see… something. A swirling vortex of pure, chaotic energy, shaped like a monstrous, clawing hand. It's vast, almost impossibly so, and for a moment, I feel an overwhelming sense of dread, a primal fear that burrows deep within me.

The rain begins, not in gentle drops, but in sheets, pelting me with icy needles. It's mixed with a gritty, metallic substance that stings my skin. I instinctively pull my arms up to protect my face, but the storm is relentless, a raging beast that seems to want to consume everything. The trees around me bend and sway, groaning under the assault, their branches cracking and splintering. I stumble forward, my legs heavy, my lungs burning with the effort to breathe against the suffocating air.

And then, I see it - a flicker of light in the distance. A small, warm glow emanating from... a clearing. With renewed desperation, I push myself onward, my heart pounding in my chest, the storm roaring in my ears. The thought of finding shelter, of escaping this terrifying maelstrom, fuels me. I just have to make it. I have to reach the light… but as I get closer, the light changes. It’s not just light anymore… it’s…**
