You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air grows heavy with electricity. The once-gentle breeze transforms into gusting winds that bend the treetops. Leaves swirl around you in chaotic patterns as the sky darkens to an ominous purple-gray.

You seek shelter, spotting a curious stone structure ahead—perhaps an abandoned cottage or shrine. As you rush toward it, fat raindrops begin to fall, quickly becoming a downpour that drums against the forest floor.

Inside the structure, you find a single room with a small hearth that, strangely, already contains glowing embers. The walls are covered with intricate carvings of trees and animals that seem to shift slightly when you're not looking directly at them.

As thunder crashes outside, you notice a small wooden box on a stone shelf. It calls to you somehow. When you open it, a soft blue light spills out, illuminating the room. Inside is a key made of what looks like polished bone.
