You’re contestant 27 because the sticker says so, a white oval with black numbers that keeps migrating across your chest as if it’s trying to find your heartbeat. The stage smells like oranges and fear. Overhead, lights tilt down like curious heads. The host’s teeth are a perfect row of piano keys, and when he grins the band in the pit plays a chord by accident.

“Welcome back,” he says, as if you were the one who left. “Tonight’s prize: the job you can’t stop describing to people at parties.”

Everyone claps with muffled oven-mitt hands. A confetti cannon exhales a sigh of receipts, cover letters, and old name badges. You catch one in your hair; it reads, in your handwriting, Sorry for the delay in my response.

Round One is a race through a maze where the walls are made of your resume. Bullet points stretch into corridors; italicized words turn into shadows that lean. You run past “collaborated cross-functionally,” which is now a shaky rope bridge over a pool of cold coffee. A former supervisor, wearing the shaggy head of a friendly lion, leans over the railing and calls, “Tell me about a time you failed,” in a voice that is your own. You answer by reaching into your pocket and pulling out the time you missed a deadline, shaped like a dead moth. You blow on it until it lives, and it flutters on ahead to show the way.

Round Two is a panel interview except the panel is made of mirrors. They ask questions you can’t hear. Your face answers anyway, ten different yous giving ten different honest versions. One of the mirrors is six years younger, eyes bright as wet pebbles. Another is the age you never got to be. One is wearing a suit that fits. When the host says, “Why are you the best person for this?” a mirror with a small crack running through the cheek says, “I know how to listen to things that don’t have mouths.” You steal that answer and swallow it like medicine.

Round Three is practical: assemble a portfolio from objects falling slowly in a column of light. You grab a sentence with both hands and knead it until it stops squeaking. You stitch together one good idea from a pile of decent ones. You lose a slide deck between two fingers and fish it out with your tongue. Someone next to you—Contestant 31, perhaps, or your old teacher dressed as a penguin—whispers, “They’re going to change the rules any minute.” You nod, then the ceiling opens like an eyelid and a new rule floats down on a ribbon: Redistribution of Points Will Occur Unexpectedly.

Points are redistributed. Your floor tile sinks two inches, then four. Cold water rises around your ankles, then your knees. Round Four is situational judgment inside a slowly filling room. You have a balloon in each hand—“Boundaries” on the left, “Urgency” on the right—and you are asked to keep them both in the air while responding to an email from someone who thinks you are a bridge. The email has teeth. You type back with your toes while you juggle, you punctuate with your breath, you draw a line with your hip. The water kisses your waist. On the balcony, the band plays “Eye of the Tiger” half a beat too slow. When asked to choose between pleasing the judges and handing a towel to the contestant who fell, you hand them your name tag instead and the water recedes as if it was only pretending.

In the break room—a garden where the cucumbers are microphones—you sip tea from a mug that says You’ve Got This in a font that apologizes. A mentor appears, the person you wish had existed: hair like clouds, pockets full of beeps from saved voicemails. They press your shoulders in a way that rearranges the very notion of shoulders. “Remember,” they tell you, “some doors only open when you stop trying to pick them.”

Round Five is a negotiation with a vending machine. It’s full of little jobs: Task Bunny, Beige Assistant, The Guy Who Fixes the Copier by Wiggling It. You feed the machine compliments. It returns you a spreadsheet that smells like rain. “What do you want, specifically?” the machine asks, its mouth full of quarters. You say, “Room to make, room to mend,” and the glass fogs up with your breath until the letters rearrange into a door.

The final round is a stage with no audience. The judges are your past selves, their feet not reaching the floor. They hold clipboards shaped like kites. The host has turned into a quiet. Your competitor walks in and it’s you, but rested. You both know the rule: only one of you can take the prize into the waking world. A drumroll starts inside your ribs. A spotlight points at a small table center stage, laid with a single object: a seed packet with your name on it. The packet reads: Contents—Work Worth Doing. Instructions—Choose where to plant.

“Pitch,” says the you in the red dress, or the you with the scabbed knee, or the you with the too-big suit. You open your mouth and nothing clever comes. Instead, you tell them about how you felt the first time something you made was useful to someone you didn’t know, like discovering a trapdoor under your own chest. You talk about wanting to be inside the kind of day where effort and care share a desk. You describe the smell of the room where you hope to sit, the hum of the people you hope to sit with, the shape of the messes you want to be trusted to clean. Your voice aligns with the rafters. The mirrors on the wall stop whispering. You do not say best or deserve. You say ready and keep going.

One of the little judges sets down her clipboard. “The last challenge,” she says, swinging her legs, “is letting go of what you look like while you do it.”

The host returns only to hand you a card. It’s blank until you touch it. Then ink appears, letter by letter, as if a hand you can’t see is writing from inside your skin. The job title isn’t a title; it’s a verb. It looks like yours, even if you’ve called it other names. Build. Guide. Listen. Stitch. Name. Grow.

The set peels away like wallpaper and behind it is a hallway lit with morning. You realize the applause has been ocean this whole time, and the judges’ pens have been gulls, and those weren’t stage lights at all but windows you forgot to open. You and your rested competitor—the you who would have won if you had made different mistakes—link pinkies. “You’ll do fine,” you tell each other. You both mean it. The band is a kettle coming to boil.

Someone offstage yanks a rope and the word READY drops glittering as an anchor. You step forward. The doormat in front of the door says Welcome Back. When you put your hand on the knob, it’s the same warm as your own forehead.

You wake with your mouth shaped around a verb, the room still ringing with a quiet that feels like permission. There’s a seed packet on your nightstand—a crumpled grocery list, really—and you can’t help but notice the empty pot on the sill, waiting like the first task on the perfect first day.
