Ah, the sea rages around you—a monstrous, churning beast of wind and water, its howling voice shaking the very timbers of your vessel. The waves rise like black mountains, swallowing the horizon, and the ship groans beneath you, its hull straining against the storm’s fury. Your crew—some pale with terror, others gripping the railing with grim determination—eyes are fixed on you, waiting for the word that will either save them or doom them all.

You stand at the helm, the wheel heavy in your hands, the salt spray stinging your face. The compass spins wildly, its needle spinning like a drunkard, and the lanterns flicker as if the storm itself is mocking your efforts. A figure—perhaps a ghostly sailor from your past, or a vision of the ship’s lost captain—steps from the shadows of the deck, their voice cutting through the gale like a blade:

*"The sea does not fear the storm, Captain. It fears the silence."*

The waves crash over the bow, and for a moment, the ship seems to tilt as if the ocean itself is testing your resolve. Then—something shifts. The wind howls not just in anger, but in *question*. The waves part, not before you, but *around* you, as if the sea itself is waiting for your answer.

What do you do?

(Do you command the crew to hold steady and ride the storm? Do you call upon an old ritual or forgotten knowledge? Or do you make a choice that defies logic—one that might break the curse of the sea?)
