...build a garden.

Not just any garden—something defiantly, beautifully *alive* in the cracked concrete heart of the dead city. The air tastes of rust and distant smoke, and the skeletal remains of skyscrapers claw at a perpetually ashen sky. Water is measured in drops, saved from the rare acid rain captured in salvaged plastic sheets. Seeds? You found them years ago, wrapped in oilcloth, buried beneath a collapsed bookstore—tomato, sunflower, kale, marigold. Precious as bullets.

You clear a patch near the base of a half-collapsed library, its steel bones groaning in the wind. Using a bent spoon and your hands, you dig through rubble and toxic soil, layering it with scavenged compost—rotted paper, bone meal, the last of your coffee grounds. It takes weeks. Your hands bleed. You dream of green.

One morning, a miracle: a tiny, trembling shoot pushes through the dark earth. Then another. You kneel, breath held, as sunflowers unfurl like yellow stars against the gray. Kale sprouts broad leaves. Tomatoes, timid at first, swell into red promises.

Others notice. A woman with a scavenged crossbow watches from a distance. A child with hollow eyes points. You don’t speak. You just share a sunflower seed, planted carefully in the dust between you.

Days pass. More join. They bring things—not just tools, but stories. Songs hummed over compost heaps. A carpenter builds raised beds from splintered doors. Someone finds a wind-up music box that plays a lullaby while bean vines climb its sides.

One night, under a sky finally pierced by stars, the first tomato is shared. You pass a slice around. It tastes of sun, of earth, of something almost forgotten—*sweetness*.

And in that moment, the apocalypse doesn’t feel like an end.

It feels like soil. Like beginnings.
