**Dream Sequence:**

You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **venture into the ruins of an old city**, hoping to find supplies or survivors.

The air is thick with dust and the scent of decay. Crumbling skyscrapers loom like skeletal giants, their windows shattered, their interiors swallowed by time. You move cautiously, your boots crunching over broken glass and rusted debris. The silence is unnerving—until you hear it: a faint, rhythmic *clicking* sound.

Your pulse quickens. You press against the wall of a half-collapsed building, peering around the corner. There, in the shadow of a toppled statue, you see **a lone figure**—a scavenger, perhaps, or something worse. They’re hunched over something, their movements jerky, almost mechanical.

Then you realize—they’re not human.

Their limbs are too long, their joints bending at unnatural angles. Their head tilts toward you, and you see **glowing, insectoid eyes** fixed on you. A low, guttural hiss escapes their throat.

You freeze. Every instinct screams at you to run, but before you can move, the creature **lurches forward**, its limbs clicking like a grotesque marionette. You barely dodge as it swipes at you, its claws scraping the concrete where you stood.

Heart pounding, you sprint deeper into the ruins, the creature’s unnatural gait echoing behind you. You don’t know what it is, but you know one thing—**you can’t let it catch you.**

As you turn a corner, you spot a **rusted metal door** slightly ajar. Without thinking, you slip inside, slamming it shut behind you. The creature’s claws scrape against the metal, but the door holds.

You’re safe—for now.

But as your breathing slows, you notice something strange. The room isn’t empty. In the dim light, you see **rows of glass vials**, each containing a swirling, bioluminescent liquid. And on the far wall, a single word is scrawled in faded red paint:

**"DON’T DRINK IT."**

Your fingers tremble as you reach for one of the vials. The liquid pulses faintly, as if alive.

Do you drink it? Or do you leave it—and face whatever waits outside?
