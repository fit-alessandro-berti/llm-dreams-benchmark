You feel a storm approaching and the air thickens with an electric hum, like the forest itself is whispering secrets to the wind. The leaves overhead rustle in warning, turning from emerald to silver as the first fat raindrops splatter against your skin—warm, almost alive, tasting faintly of salt and wild honey when one lands on your lips.

You quicken your pace, branches snagging at your sleeves like insistent old friends, but there's no path ahead, only a deepening gloom where sunlight used to dance. Thunder rolls in, not with a crack but a deep, resonant laugh, echoing from the trees as if the storm is an old acquaintance come to play. Lightning forks the sky, illuminating a clearing you swear wasn't there moments ago—a glade ringed by ancient oaks whose roots twist into impossible shapes, like the veins of sleeping giants.

In the center stands a door. Not carved from wood or stone, but woven from vines and fireflies, pulsing with a soft, inviting glow. Rain hammers down now, turning the ground to mud that pulls at your boots, but curiosity tugs harder. You push the door open, and the world flips.

Inside, the storm rages on, but it's a ballroom of chaos: clouds swirl like gowns on invisible dancers, rain sheets cascade as shimmering curtains, and thunder provides a bassline to some forgotten waltz. You spin into the fray, weightless, your clothes transforming into feathers that let you glide between the tempests. A figure emerges from the mist—a fox with eyes like polished amber, offering a hand (or paw?) etched with constellations.

"Dance with the gale," it says, voice like wind chimes in a hurricane, "and wake when the eye passes."

You take its paw, and the world blurs into a symphony of spins and dives, laughter bubbling up from your chest as lightning applauds. The storm carries you higher, through canopies of stars hidden in the clouds, until exhaustion claims you mid-twirl.

You awaken tangled in your bedsheets, the patter of real rain against the windowpane fading like an encore. The forest lingers in your mind, door ajar, waiting for the next dream to pull you back. Sweet slumbers.
