...written in a language you’ve never seen before—strange looping symbols and shapes that seem to rearrange themselves when you blink. The paper hums faintly, as though alive. Around you, the classroom begins to blur, the walls stretching impossibly far upward until they dissolve into a starlit sky. Other students seem focused, scribbling effortlessly as if they understand everything.  

Your hands clutch the pen but when you press it to the page, instead of words, you draw out fragments of scenes: a staircase twisting into fog, a doorway opening onto a field of mirrors, a figure standing at the edge of a cliff waiting for you. Strangely, the proctor isn’t watching—you realize no one is.  

It dawns on you that the exam isn’t about memorization but about choosing. Each "question" is a door, and your answers are the paths you sketch into existence.  

As you lean closer to the paper, the symbols rearrange into a single question, written in clear words for the first time:  

**“Where do you wish this path to lead you?”**  

Would you like me to continue the dream *as an exploration of each possible choice* (multiple paths), or would you like me to choose a single unfolding direction and follow it deeply?
