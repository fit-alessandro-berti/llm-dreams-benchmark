...written in a language that looks distinctly like ancient hieroglyphs mixed with modern emoji. As you squint to try to decipher the first question, the text begins to crawl off the page like tiny black spiders, scurrying off the edge of the desk.

You look up to ask the professor for help, but the podium at the front of the room is empty. In its place sits a large, glowing microwave. A voice over the loudspeaker—not the professor's, but your own voice echo-distorted—booms, "You have five minutes to solve the ingredient list."

Panic sets in. You look back at your paper. The crawling ink has reformed itself into a single, pulsing question:

**"Describe the exact color of the wind. Use a number two pencil."**

You frantically search your pockets for a pencil, but instead, you pull out an endless stream of colorful scarves, followed by a live duck. The duck looks at you, winks, and whispers, "You forgot to study the clouds."

Suddenly, the floor turns into a giant trampoline, and the ceiling dissolves into a clear blue sky. You realize with a jolt of relief that the exam isn't a test of knowledge; it’s a test of altitude. You drop the duck, grab your scarf-stream, and begin to bounce, higher and higher, toward a sun that looks suspiciously like a giant, golden lemon. Just as you reach out to peel it, the alarm rings—not the school bell, but your waking alarm. The lemon squirts lemonade into your eyes, stinging them shut, and you wake up with a gasp, your heart pounding against your ribs like a trapped bird.
