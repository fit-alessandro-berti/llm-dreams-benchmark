...find the Source of the Hum before the twin suns set.

The air tastes different here—like copper and crushed jasmine. You look down at your hands and see they are covered in symbols painted in blue ash, markings you don’t recognize but somehow understand to be a map.

You are standing in a sprawling bazaar carved entirely out of red sandstone. There are no cars, no phones, no electric lights; only the flicker of oil lamps and the smell of roasting spices. The people around you are tall, wearing robes of woven glass that chime when they move. They don't look at you, but they part like water as you walk, as if you are carrying something dangerous.

You check your pocket. It’s there. A heavy, cold stone that vibrates against your hip.

You realize that the "Hum" is the sound of the world holding itself together, and it is fading. You have to climb the great spiraling tower in the distance—the one that looks like a frozen tornado of marble. You begin to run, but in true dream fashion, your legs feel heavy, as if you are wading through molasses. The shadows of the towers are stretching longer, reaching for you, and you know with absolute, terrifying certainty that if you don't place the stone at the top of the tower before the sky turns purple, you will never wake up again.
