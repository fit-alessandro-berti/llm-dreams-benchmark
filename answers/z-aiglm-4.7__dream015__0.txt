Despite the hardships, you decide to **plant a garden in the crater of a fallen skyscraper.**

Not a garden of vegetables—those died with the old world—but a garden of light. You spend the morning scavenging through the gray, powdery ash, ignoring the distant, guttural growls of the things that prowl the perimeter. Your pockets are heavy with jagged shards of stained glass scavenged from a shattered cathedral miles away.

You kneel on the cracked concrete and begin to dig. The earth here is dry and unforgiving, smelling of rust and old rain, but you press the glass shards into the soil as if they were seeds. You arrange them by color: ruby red next to deep azure, amber beside emerald.

In the logic of the dream, the impossible happens immediately. As the twin suns—one pale white, one angry red—dip below the jagged horizon, the "seeds" catch the last of the light. They begin to hum. Thin, crystalline shoots shoot up from the concrete, spiraling upward rapidly. Within moments, they bloom into translucent, chiming flowers that glow with an inner, pulsing luminescence.

The air around you warms. The howling wind dies down, replaced by the soft, melodic ringing of thousands of glass petals tapping against one another. You sit back on your heels, exhausted but at peace. The dangers of the wasteland feel far away, held back by the perimeter of light you’ve created. In this moment, you aren't a survivor; you are a custodian of beauty in a world that forgot what it looked like.
