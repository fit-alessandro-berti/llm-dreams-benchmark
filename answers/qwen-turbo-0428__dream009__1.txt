You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to survive. The air smells different—earthy, smoky, and filled with the scent of wood and livestock. You're dressed in simple, coarse fabric, and your feet are bare. Around you, thatched-roof huts line a dirt path, and people in traditional clothing move about, speaking a language you barely understand.

A child runs past you, laughing, and an old woman gives you a wary look before muttering something under her breath. You try to speak, but your voice comes out strange, unfamiliar. Panic rises in your chest, but you force yourself to stay calm. You need to find answers.

As you walk, you notice a symbol carved into a tree—something that looks like a map or a marker. It's the same symbol you saw in your last dream, the one that led you here. You follow it, heart pounding, through fields and forests, until you come upon a stone archway hidden behind ivy. It hums faintly, as if alive.

You step through, and the world shifts again. Now you're in a grand hall with towering pillars and glowing runes. A figure stands at the center, cloaked in shadows. They turn, and their eyes meet yours—mirror images of your own.

"You've returned," they say, voice echoing. "The cycle is not yet broken."

You realize, with a mix of fear and wonder, that this is no ordinary dream. This is a test. A choice. And the fate of both worlds may rest in your hands.
