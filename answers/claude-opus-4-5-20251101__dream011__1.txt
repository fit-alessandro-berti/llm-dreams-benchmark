*settling into the uncomfortable desk chair, pencil in hand*

...written in a language I somehow understand but have never seen before. The symbols shift and rearrange themselves each time I blink—sometimes they look like mathematical equations, sometimes like musical notation, sometimes like my grandmother's handwriting.

The first question reads: **\Explain the color of Thursday.\**

I realize I know the answer. I *know* it. It's on the tip of my tongue, tasting like copper and forgotten birthdays. But when I try to write, my pencil has become impossibly heavy.

I look around. The other students are writing furiously, their papers already full, but their faces are all people I almost recognize—composites of everyone I've ever disappointed.

The clock on the wall has thirteen hours, and the hands are spinning backward.

The proctor approaches my desk. She leans down and whispers, \ were supposed to study the *other* textbook.\ Her breath smells like the library in winter.

I flip to the next question: **\ a map to somewhere you've never been but always meant to return to.\ hand starts moving on its own...

*The fluorescent lights begin to hum a melody I recognize from childhood*
