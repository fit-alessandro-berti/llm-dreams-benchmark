...realize the project isn't in any language you’ve ever seen—symbols shift on the screen like liquid, rewriting themselves the moment you look away. Your keyboard starts whispering suggestions in a voice that sounds like your third-grade teacher. You glance up, and your boss is floating three feet above the floor, sipping coffee from a cup that refills itself with starlight. The clock on the wall ticks backward, but your laptop battery drains faster the more you try to ignore it. Your hands hover over the keyboard, not because you’re scared—but because your fingers have turned into narrow strips of paper covered in tiny, glowing checkmarks. You wonder: *Do you even have a project to do, or are you the project?* The air smells like burnt cinnamon. A notification pops up: *"Syncing consciousness... 73% complete."* You almost reply, *"I need an extension,"* but your mouth tastes like old code.
