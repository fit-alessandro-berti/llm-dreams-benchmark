As your hand meets theirs, the cold gray of the concrete begins to soften, turning into something that feels like moss under your feet. The roar of the city traffic doesn't vanish; instead, it harmonizes, the honking horns turning into the deep, resonant notes of a cello, and the screeching brakes becoming the soft trill of a flute.

The strangers don’t have faces you can quite pin down—their features shift like reflections in a moving stream—but their eyes are steady and warm, glowing with the amber light of a hearth. One of them, a woman wearing a coat woven from old maps, leans in and whispers, "The way back isn't a place, it’s a rhythm."

She takes your hand, and suddenly the group begins to move, not through the streets, but *through* the buildings themselves. You step through a brick wall that feels like cool water, emerging into a plaza where the skyscrapers have grown leaves of stained glass. The air smells of ozone and jasmine. 

As you walk, you realize you aren't walking toward a destination, but away from the weight of your own shadow. With every step the strangers take with you, the heavy fog of loneliness in your chest lifts, transforming into tiny, glowing birds that flutter out of your collar and join the constellations swirling above the rooftops.

"We’re almost there," the man with the lantern says, his voice sounding like the first rain after a long drought. 

He holds the lantern high, and the light hits a door standing alone in the middle of a park. It’s a door you recognize—the door to a house from your childhood, or perhaps a house you only saw once in a book. You reach for the handle, and as you turn it, you look back to thank them.

But the strangers are already fading into the golden light of the streetlamps, their forms dissolving into shimmering dust. You realize then that they weren't strangers at all; they were pieces of your own courage you had forgotten you owned. 

You step through the door, and the city vanishes. You are no longer lost. You are exactly where you need to be, wrapped in the quiet, hummed melody of a world that finally knows your name. 

The light grows brighter, warmer, until it is all you can see—and then, you wake up.
