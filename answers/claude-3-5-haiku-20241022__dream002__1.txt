Here's a continuation of the dream:

You feel a storm approaching and the once-calm forest transforms around you. The trees begin to sway violently, their branches creaking and groaning under the sudden gusts of wind. Dark, heavy clouds roll in, blocking out the sunlight and casting an ominous shadow over the landscape.

A sharp crack of lightning splits the sky, followed by a deep, rumbling thunderclap that seems to shake the very ground beneath your feet. Rain begins to fall, first in scattered droplets, then quickly intensifying into a torrential downpour. The forest floor becomes slick with moisture, and you can smell the earthy scent of wet leaves and damp soil.

As you seek shelter, you notice something unusual—the trees seem to be moving in a way that defies natural movement. Shadows dart between the trunks, and whispers echo just beyond your comprehension. You're not sure if you're experiencing the storm or if the storm is experiencing you.
