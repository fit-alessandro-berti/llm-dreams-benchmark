…adapt fast if you want to survive. The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth, and the distant clang of metal tells you you’re somewhere where craftsmanship—not machines—rules the day.

You pull yourself upright, brushing dust from clothing that definitely isn’t yours: rough-spun linen, a heavy leather belt, boots that have seen better years. When you step outside, you find a settlement that looks like something from a half-remembered textbook—timber houses, open fires, dirt paths, smoke drifting from blacksmith forges. People stare at you with a mix of curiosity and suspicion.

You quickly realize you need to **blend in.** That means learning the customs, the language, the rhythm of life here. You ask questions carefully, copying their gestures, their greetings, their pace. You volunteer to help with simple tasks—hauling water, stacking firewood—just enough to make yourself useful without giving away how lost you truly are.

But the more you explore, the more you notice things that don’t fit. A strange symbol carved into doorframes. Whispered conversations that stop the moment you approach. The blacksmith’s forge glowing an unnatural shade of blue late at night.

And then one evening, as you’re returning to the small shelter someone generously offered you, you see a figure waiting in the shadows—cloaked, still, watching you with an intensity that makes your skin prickle.

“You’re not from here,” they say quietly. “And time has brought you for a reason.”

Before you can speak, they beckon you closer.

“Come. There’s something you need to see. Something only someone *outside this era* can understand.”

And with that, your dream pulls you deeper into the mystery of why you’ve been brought to this forgotten age—and what part you’re meant to play in it.
