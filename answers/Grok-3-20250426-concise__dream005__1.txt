overhear snippets of bizarre conversations. One group debates whether clouds are secretly alien ships; another argues about the best way to convince a toaster to love you. You spot your friend across the room, but each step toward them stretches the floor like taffy. A masked figure hands you a glowing drink that hums softly. You sip it, and suddenly you’re floating above the party, seeing everyone’s thoughts as colorful shapes. Your friend waves, their thoughts a bright red spiral, and you wake up.
