…and each challenge is unnervingly specific to the pieces of you that nobody else sees.

First round: “Prove you know what you’re doing.”
They drop you into a windowless hall lined with doors, each labeled with something you’re “supposed” to be: Responsible, Productive, Impressive, Dependable. A booming voice says, “Pick one. You have ten seconds.”

But you notice a thin, barely visible door in the corner labeled: Curious.

If you pick any of the big doors, you sense you’ll be tested on memorized scripts, flawless competence, the version of you you’ve rehearsed for interviews. The thought makes your stomach clench.

You walk to Curious.

As your hand touches the knob, the clock stops. The booming voice pauses, then murmurs, almost amused: “…Proceed.”

Inside, the room shifts into the first “challenge”: an impossible project on an impossible timeline, everyone talking at once, questions flying. But instead of panicking, you start asking better questions. Walls display diagrams, post-its float in the air, equations dissolve and rearrange as you touch them. When you don’t know something, the dream lets you admit it—and the environment responds, surfaces lighting up with resources instead of punishment.

You realize the test isn’t “Have all the answers.”
It’s “Will you keep thinking?”

You pass without being told you passed. The scene just melts.

Second round: “Prove you can handle failure.”
You’re in an auditorium, onstage. The grand prize—your dream job—is printed on an envelope on a lectern. The audience is everyone whose approval you’ve ever wanted: parents, old teachers, exes, bosses, the version of yourself who thought you’d be further along by now.

A panelist reads out a case scenario from your past, but twisted: every mistake exaggerated, every half-finished project spotlighted. They invite the audience to vote on whether someone “like you” deserves a dream job.

Green light: yes. Red light: no.
The entire hall glows red.

The stage floor tilts; the microphone howls with feedback; shame rushes up, that old, familiar heat. A voice in your ear whispers, “Explain yourself. Redeem yourself. Beg.”

Instead, you grip the lectern, feel how unreal the wood grain is, how it loops like a GIF. You hear your own voice saying, quietly: “Of course you voted red. You only know the version of me I’ve edited for you. You’re not my judge; you’re my audience.”

The red light flickers, confused.

You admit, out loud, one specific real failure that still makes you wince—and then you say what you learned, the concrete pivot you made because of it. As you speak honestly, some of the red bulbs blink out. Not all turn green; some stay dark, and that’s fine. The floor levels. The panelist nods once, like a checkpoint reached.

You’re not told you’ve passed this, either. The scene folds again.

Third round: “Prove this is actually your dream.”
Now it’s quiet: a long corridor lined with offices, studios, labs, workshops—different versions of your “dream job” pulled from every era of your life. Inside each one, a version of you is already working there.

- In one room, you’re hyper-respected but exhausted, answering emails at midnight.
- In another, you’re wildly creative but broke and terrified.
- In another, you’re stable and safe, but your eyes look dim.
- In yet another, everything is perfect, glossy, curated—and feels strangely hollow, like a brochure.

A guide you never quite see says, “Choose the prize.”

You walk past them, looking carefully. The versions of you barely glance up. They’re fine. Competent. Some are admirable. None feel like home.

At the very end of the corridor, there’s a workspace that looks…unfinished. Cables out, notes pinned at odd angles, a weird combination of disciplines that doesn’t fit a neat title. The future here is not guaranteed. There is risk, responsibility, impact, room to grow—and obvious places you’re not yet qualified.

On the door, instead of a job title, there’s a sentence: “The role you will continuously grow into.”

The guide says, “That one isn’t the safest. It will ask for all of you.”

You realize that’s the only option that feels alive.

You choose it.

Final round: “Prove you’re willing to be seen.”

Instantly, you’re no longer in a corridor; you’re sitting down for the final “interview.” No panel. Just one person across from you: it’s you, a few years older, clearly doing the work you chose.

They ask you the questions you’re most afraid of:

- “What are you pretending doesn’t scare you?”
- “What would you do here on a bad day, when the shine is gone?”
- “If this job doesn’t fix your life, will you still want it?”
- “Are you chasing the title, or the work?”

The dream will not let you give clever answers. Every lie tastes like chalk in your mouth. So you answer honestly:

You admit that you want to feel useful, that you’re afraid of wasting your potential, of being ordinary, of being found out as not as capable as people think. You admit you want your work to matter to someone real, not just look good on paper. You admit you’ve sometimes chased prestige because it was easier than admitting what you really loved.

Future-you listens. They don’t flinch.

At the end, they lean forward and say, “Then here’s the real prize: You don’t get a guarantee. You get a chance, and the responsibility to show up as this version of yourself—curious, honest, growing. If that’s still your dream job, it’s yours.”

A simple contract appears on the table. No salary listed, no prestige metrics, just:

“Your dream job:
- Do work that matters to you.
- Keep learning faster than you fear failing.
- Let people see who you are while you do it.”

You sign.

As the pen touches the paper, the competitions sets collapse like stage props. The cheering you expected never comes. Instead, there’s a quiet, grounded certainty in your chest, as if some huge machine has clicked into alignment.

You wake up with one very clear thought:

The dream job wasn’t a door someone else opened for you.

It was the moment you decided which part of yourself you’d let run your life from now on—and you start looking, that same morning, for the place in your real world where that version of you can begin.
