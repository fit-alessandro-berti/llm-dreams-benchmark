# The Dream Continues...

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find water before nightfall.**

The sun hangs lower than you'd like, casting long shadows through unfamiliar trees. Your throat is already dry. You notice a worn footpath leading downhill—paths often lead to water sources, you think, though you're not sure how you know this.

Following it, you pass a woman in rough-spun clothing carrying a clay jug on her shoulder. She looks at you strangely—*your clothes*—and you glance down to see you're wearing some odd combination of your modern pajamas and medieval-looking boots that weren't there a moment ago. Dream logic.

The path opens to a village square with a stone well at its center. As you approach, the bucket feels impossibly heavy, the rope rough and real against your palms. When you finally taste the water, it's the coldest, clearest water you've ever experienced.

A child tugs at your sleeve, speaking in a language that shifts between familiar and foreign. They point urgently toward the forest edge where smoke rises—too much smoke. The villagers are beginning to run, grabbing what they can carry.

You realize you need to **decide: run with them, or find out what you're meant to do here.**

The dream waits for your choice, the moment stretching like honey...
