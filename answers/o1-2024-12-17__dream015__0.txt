...keep moving forward, determined to survive. You’ve been traversing this ruined landscape for weeks now, careful to avoid the raiders and predatory creatures that roam the old highways and half-collapsed suburbs. Buildings lie in broken angles, their once-gleaming windows now cracked, reflecting a sun dulled by dust and debris. The air is thick, stale, and tastes faintly of rust and ash.

You pick your way through what was once a strip mall—uneven concrete floors, looted storefronts with shredded awnings snapping quietly in a faint breeze. You keep one hand near the makeshift blade strapped to your thigh. It’s a piece of sharpened rebar, crudely fashioned but effective enough against the desperate and the hungry. In your other hand, you clutch a dented metal canteen. There’s a faint slosh of water inside, but it’s no more than a mouthful at best.

You’re not sure what draws you to the back of an old electronics store. Maybe it’s just a need for shelter—somewhere hidden where you can rest. The building’s back room smells musty, filled with overturned shelving and shattered plastic casings. You navigate the darkness until you find a corner that feels safe enough to sit down. Just as you’re settling in, your boot strikes something hollow beneath a collapsed display rack.

Pushing aside tangled wires and broken device packaging, you discover a hinged trapdoor in the floor. It might lead to a maintenance cellar, or perhaps some kind of hidden storage—either way, it’s worth a look. You pry it open, the hinges groaning loudly, and peer inside. There’s a narrow ladder leading down into darkness. You flick your lighter, a tiny blue flame illuminating dusty rungs and concrete walls. Down there might be supplies—or a threat you’re not prepared to face.

You descend carefully, every footstep testing the ladder’s strength. At the bottom is a cramped room that seems untouched by the chaos above. Stacked neatly along one wall are aluminum cans, each carefully sealed, with handwritten labels listing dates and contents: beans, dried fruit, water—precious water. Relief washes over you, and then suspicion follows. Who left these supplies here? And would they return?

Your heart pounds with a confusing mix of hope and dread. A faint scratching noise from behind a stack of boxes makes you freeze. You swallow, hand reaching for the rebar knife. Slowly, you inch around the corner, lighter still flickering. There, curled up in a makeshift sleeping bag, is a child—perhaps nine or ten years old—thin, dirty, and trembling. They look at you with a mixture of terror and pleading, their eyes reflecting the tiny flame like frightened animals caught in headlights.

You raise your free hand, palm facing the child, and speak softly, voice echoing in the hush. You say something reassuring, something you aren’t sure you believe yourself. In this world, kindness is a currency too rare and too costly. Yet something in you refuses to abandon it. The child must belong to whoever set up this stash of supplies. Maybe they are alone, maybe not. Every choice you’ve made since this world fell apart has shaped who you’ve become. You can walk away with what you need, or you can try to protect what innocence remains.

Outside, the wind moans through empty streets. Up above, the sun continues its slow, red arc across a wounded sky. In this moment, hunched in the darkness with a terrified child and precious resources at hand, you decide that you will not become another monster roaming the wasteland. You put down your weapon, carefully, and open the canteen. Offering a sip of water, you whisper gently, “It’s going to be okay,” though you’re not sure if that’s true. But you choose to believe it, if only for a moment, and that makes all the difference.
