walk briskly down the nearest street, scanning the signs and landmarks for any clue. The city hums with life—strangers rush past, neon lights flicker, and distant sirens wail—but nothing feels familiar. Your heart races as you check your pockets, hoping for a map or a note, but there’s nothing.

Then, you notice a small, ornate compass in your palm. It wasn’t there before. The needle spins wildly before settling on a direction. You follow it, weaving through alleys and plazas, until you reach a towering glass building. The lobby is empty except for a receptionist who smiles knowingly.

“You’re late,” they say, handing you a key. “The meeting is on the 42nd floor. But be careful—some doors shouldn’t be opened.”

As the elevator ascends, the numbers blur, and when the doors open, you step into a room where everyone is wearing masks of your own face. They turn in unison and say, “We’ve been waiting for you.”

What do you do next?

(Would you like to continue the dream, or explore a different path?)
