…band together with the scattered survivors you’ve encountered. Though hunger gnaws at your insides and the acrid scent of burning rubble stings your nostrils, you cannot face this broken world alone. 

You stumble across a battered storefront beneath a collapsed highway overpass. Once, it might have been a small family grocery, its produce vibrant and fresh—but now, only overturned shelves and shattered glass remain. Amid the dust and grime, you find footprints other than your own, leading deeper inside. Your heart clenches, torn between fear and hope. If other survivors are here, you must approach cautiously; desperation can twist even the most kindhearted soul into something treacherous.

Pressing quietly forward, you step through the wreckage. The muffled rustle of plastic and the soft scrape of a boot against tile alert you to someone lurking behind the register counter. Raising your hands in a gesture of peace, you speak into the gloom: “I’m not here to hurt anyone. I’m just looking for help… maybe we can share what we have.” The only response at first is silence and the faint hum of distant wind.

Then, a figure stands—barely more than a silhouette in the dimness. It’s a young woman, face streaked with soot and fear, clutching a piece of twisted metal like a weapon. Behind her, two children crouch, their eyes wide and hollowed with hunger. She regards you warily, and you realize you must earn her trust. You slide your backpack off your shoulders, taking care not to make any sudden moves. Opening it, you show her its scant contents: a half-empty water bottle, a dented can of beans, a ragged medical kit missing several key components. Almost nothing, but offered willingly.

The woman’s grip loosens fractionally, and something in her eyes softens. A moment later, she gestures for you to stay put while she disappears into the back room. When she returns, she has one small thing to share: a packet of dried fruit. Its smell—faintly sweet and strangely comforting—tells you it’s old but not spoiled. She divides it carefully: a piece for the children, a piece for you, and one for herself. Chewing slowly, you relish the simple taste, as if it were a gourmet feast in a lost world.

As you sit together in tense camaraderie, you begin to discuss what’s beyond these ruined walls. The woman tells you there’s a rumored oasis far to the east, where a natural spring still flows clean and green herbs sprout in hidden valleys. Getting there won’t be easy. Raiders have been spotted roaming the old interstate, and monstrous shapes skulk in the broken warehouses and factories that line the route. But staying here means dwindling hope—eventually running out of food, out of safe places to hide.

You reach out, lightly touching her shoulder to show that you mean what you say next: “We should try. Together, we might stand a chance.” She searches your face for deception and finds none. The children remain silent but lean closer, as if drawn by the possibility of something better.

So begins your fragile alliance. You spend the afternoon scavenging the shelves, carefully prying open a few remaining cans and jars, dividing what you find into equal shares. The plan forms as you work: at dawn, you’ll move eastward, using the fallen overpass as partial cover. You will travel by night, avoiding the wide-open roads where desperate men lie in wait. You will trust each other as best you can, because in this world, trust is not only rare, it is the first step toward survival.

By the dying light of day, you settle into a quiet watch, taking turns sleeping fitfully on a pile of damp cardboard. Outside, the wind sighs through twisted metal beams, and distant cries—animal or human, you cannot tell—echo through empty streets. Despite the uncertainty and terror that lurks in the dark corners of this new reality, you hold onto a fragile kernel of resolve. Where there is trust, there is purpose. Where there is alliance, there is the chance to rebuild something from the ashes.

In this dream, you do not awaken yet. Instead, you drift off into restless sleep, surrounded by your new companions, dreaming of a greener horizon where the world might begin again.
