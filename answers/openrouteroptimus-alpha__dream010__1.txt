unexpected twists. The first challenge is to solve a puzzle that seems tailored to your deepest interests—symbols and clues related to your greatest passions appear, and you realize the answer lies not in logic but in intuition. You close your eyes, let your hands move, and the puzzle clicks open.

The next round brings you to a vast, echoing hall with doors lining the walls. Each door has a phrase that seems to mirror your own doubts and fears. Only by acknowledging them aloud does a single, golden door unlock. You step through, your heart pounding.

Now you stand on a stage, spotlights blinding, a panel of shadowy figures before you. They invite you to speak about your dreams—not just the job you want, but what truly motivates you, what you'd do if there were no rules or limitations. Your voice shakes, but you find honesty as your anchor.

As the competition nears its end, the final task is surprisingly gentle: you are asked to mentor someone else, to help them through a challenge you once faced yourself. In guiding them, you realize how much you’ve grown.

Suddenly, you're handed an envelope. Inside is not a contract, but a mirror—your own face, alight with joy and confidence. You realize the prize was never the job itself, but the knowledge that you are ready for it, whatever form it takes. The dream dissolves into light, and you wake with a heart full of hope for what’s to come.
