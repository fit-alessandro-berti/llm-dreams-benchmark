set out on a journey to find a rumored safe haven, a place whispered about in hushed tones by the few survivors you’ve encountered. You gather what little you have—a tattered map scratched onto a piece of cloth, a half-empty canteen, and a rusty knife—and step out into the ashen wasteland. The sky above is a dull gray, streaked with ominous clouds, and the air carries the faint sting of smoke. 
As you walk, you hear the crunch of brittle earth beneath your boots and the distant howl of something wild, maybe animal, maybe not. Your path leads you toward a crumbling city skyline, its jagged silhouettes a reminder of what once was. Along the way, you spot a flickering light in the distance—a signal, perhaps? You decide to investigate, driven by a mix of hope and desperation.
Reaching the source, you find an abandoned campsite, its fire still smoldering. Scattered around are signs of a struggle: overturned crates, a torn journal, and a single boot with no match. You pick up the journal and flip through its weathered pages. The last entry, written in a shaky hand, reads, “They came at night. Heading west was our only chance.” A chill runs down your spine as you realize you’re not alone—soft footsteps echo behind you. You grip your knife tightly and turn to face whatever’s coming, ready to fight for your survival and the dream of that safe haven.
