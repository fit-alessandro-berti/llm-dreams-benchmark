you hear the distant rumble of thunder. The leaves above you begin to rustle violently, and the air grows thick with tension. Before you has emerged a towering oak tree, its branches reaching out like skeletal fingers, as if trying to guide you. 

The wind picks up, and you notice that the ground beneath your feet is not solid earth but shifting, swirling patches of mist. You can barely see where one patch ends and another begins. The mist seems to pulse with an eerie light, and you feel a strange pull toward it.

Suddenly, a figure appears at the base of the oak tree—a silhouette cloaked in shadows, its face obscured by a hood. The figure speaks, its voice low and echoing, like the wind itself:

*"The storm is near, but the path forward is uncertain. Do you trust yourself enough to follow?"*

Before you can respond, the ground beneath you gives way, and you find yourself stepping into the mist. The world around you distorts, colors blending together in a kaleidoscope of hues. You feel lighter, as if you're no longer bound by gravity, and the wind carries you through the shifting clouds.

As you float, you catch glimpses of strange, otherworldly landscapes—ancient ruins, glowing forests, and vast oceans stretching endlessly. Each place feels familiar yet foreign, as though you've seen them before in dreams or in moments of deep reflection.

The storm rages on outside the mist, but here, time seems to stretch and bend. You have the sense that you are not just moving through space, but also through time. The past and future merge, and you realize that the choice before you is not just about where to go, but who you are becoming.

And then, as abruptly as it began, the mist begins to thin. The ground solidifies once more, and you find yourself standing at the foot of the oak tree again, the storm still raging outside. The figure is gone, but the oak stands tall, its branches swaying gently in the wind.

You take a deep breath and step forward, feeling both uncertain and determined. The path ahead is still unclear, but you know that you must continue.
