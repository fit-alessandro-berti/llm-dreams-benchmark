Your dream continues, the fluorescent lights humming like a swarm of angry bees overhead. Sweat beads on your forehead, slicking your hair back as you stare at the impossibly large project board flickering with red deadline timers. Your boss, Mr. Henderson, stands rigid behind you, his hands clasped behind his back, radiating impatience like heat from asphalt.

**The impossible deadline isn't just tight—it's a cruel joke.** The client, a faceless entity from a nightmare email thread, demanded a revolutionary product *yesterday*. The technical specs alone could fill a library. Your colleagues, usually a reassuring presence, are now ghostly silhouettes receding into the white-washed walls, their whispers dissolving into the oppressive silence.

Your fingers hover over the keyboard, paralyzed. Every click feels like pushing a boulder uphill. The cursor blinks, mocking you, as Henderson clears his throat, the sound sharp and demanding.

> **"Start,"** he hisses. **"Now. Before this becomes a *permanent* record of failure."**

Your heart hammers against your ribs. The project files, a labyrinth of code and specifications, seem to shrink and expand in your vision, taunting you. The clock on the wall ticks backward. **This is no dream.** This is the crushing weight of expectation made flesh.

**The dream ends here, with your fingers frozen over the keyboard and Henderson's impatient gaze boring into you.** But what happens next? Do you find a way to scream, only to wake to the gentle buzz of your alarm clock? Do you discover Henderson is just a shadow, dissolving into the wall? Or does the impossible deadline somehow become your escape, revealing a hidden truth about the project itself?

What path through this impossible work nightmare do you want your dream to take?
