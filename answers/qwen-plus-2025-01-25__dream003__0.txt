symbols etched into its surface, glowing faintly as if alive with an inner energy. The patterns seem to shift and rearrange themselves whenever you blink, like they're trying to convey a message or puzzle. You reach out to touch the box, and the moment your fingers make contact, a soft hum resonates through the air.

The hum grows louder, and suddenly, words form in your mind—not spoken aloud but felt deep within. *"To open me, you must understand me."* 

You step back, startled, but curiosity overtakes fear. Examining the box more carefully, you notice that the glowing patterns resemble constellations, though not ones from any known sky. Some of the symbols pulse brighter than others, almost like buttons waiting to be pressed. Tentatively, you trace one of the brightest marks with your fingertip.

As soon as you do, the box responds. A section of its surface slides aside, revealing a small compartment containing a single crystal shard. It shimmers with hues of blue and green, casting tiny rainbows across the room. Picking it up, you feel a surge of warmth spreading through your hand, followed by another mental whisper: *"This is but a fragment. Seek the others."*

Before you can process what this means, the scene around you begins to dissolve. The room fades away, replaced by a vast desert under two suns. In the distance, towering ruins rise from the sands, their architecture both alien and familiar. The crystal in your hand pulses once, pointing toward the ruins as if guiding you.

Your dream shifts again, pulling you forward on a journey filled with riddles, ancient secrets, and hidden truths. Each step brings new challenges and revelations, all tied to the mysterious box and its purpose. But why has it chosen you? And what lies at the end of this path?

The dream lingers just long enough for you to wonder... before fading into darkness.
