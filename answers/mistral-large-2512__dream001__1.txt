**The Dream Continues…**

You check your pockets—no phone, no wallet, no map. Just a single, crumpled business card with a name scrawled in ink: *"Dr. Elias Voss – The Clocktower, 12th Floor."* The ink smudges as you try to read it, the letters rearranging themselves like living things.

The city around you is alive in a way that feels *wrong*. The streets twist and loop, alleys yawn open where none were before, and the buildings lean in as if whispering. A clock chimes somewhere—*nine times*—but the sky is the color of dusk, or dawn, or neither. You ask a passerby for directions, but their face is a smooth, featureless oval, their voice a hum like a radio tuned between stations. *"Third left, then straight until the river forgets its name,"* they murmur before dissolving into mist.

You run.

The cobblestones beneath your feet shift, rearranging into patterns that make your eyes ache. A shadow detaches from a lamppost—a figure in a long coat, their back to you, moving with eerie precision. You follow, heart hammering, because they seem to *know* where they’re going. The air smells like ozone and old paper.

Then, the Clocktower appears.

It wasn’t there a second ago. A monstrous thing of black iron and gears, its face missing numbers, its hands spinning backward. The door groans open before you can touch it, revealing a spiral staircase that ascends into darkness. A voice echoes from above—*"You’re late, but not too late."* It sounds like your own, but older, tired.

You take the first step.

The stairs creak underfoot, but the sound doesn’t match your steps. The walls are lined with doors—hundreds of them, some ajar, some sealed with rusted locks. From behind one, you hear laughter. From another, the sound of a typewriter clacking in an empty room. A third door has a nameplate: *"YOUR NAME HERE."* You don’t dare touch it.

At the 12th floor, the staircase ends in a circular room. No windows. No exits. Just a single desk, and behind it, a man—*Dr. Voss?*—with his back turned, writing in a ledger. The pen scratches like nails on glass.

*"You made it,"* he says, without turning. *"Though I suppose that’s the point of dreams, isn’t it? To arrive where you’re meant to be, even if you don’t know why."*

You open your mouth to ask what the meeting is about, but the words won’t come. The ledger flips open to a page with your name at the top, followed by a list of dates—some in the past, some in the future, some that don’t exist. At the bottom, in bold ink: *"TERMS: AGREED."*

Dr. Voss finally turns. His face is yours.

*"Sign here,"* he says, sliding the ledger toward you. The pen is warm, almost *breathing*.

And then you wake up—

—*or do you?*

Because the ledger is still on your nightstand. And the ink is still wet.
