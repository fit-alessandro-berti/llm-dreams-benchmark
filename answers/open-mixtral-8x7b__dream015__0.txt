With determination in your heart, you gather a small group of survivors and set off on the long and dangerous journey. Along the way, you face many challenges, from scavenging for food and water to avoiding hostile groups of bandits and mutated creatures.

Despite the odds, your group perseveres, using your skills and knowledge to survive and navigate the harsh terrain. After weeks of travel, you finally come across a heavily fortified settlement, surrounded by walls and guard towers.

As you approach, the guards challenge you, but when you tell them of your journey and the rumors of the sanctuary, they allow you to enter. Inside, you find a thriving community, with farms, markets, and schools.
