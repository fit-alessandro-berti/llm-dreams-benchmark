…each group seems to be in the middle of an intense conversation, but none of their words make sense. It’s as if they are speaking in a language you almost recognize—sounds cascade together in familiar rhythms, yet the meaning hovers just out of reach, like a word on the tip of your tongue.  

One group is gathered around a table piled high with food, though you notice that every dish seems to be slowly shifting into something else: a bowl of cherries morphs into small red birds, a loaf of bread drips into wax, glasses of water ripple upward rather than downward. Nobody reacts to it.  

You move on, scanning the crowd for the one face you know. The next group is seated in a loose circle on the floor. They are staring intently at a spot between them where there’s only empty space. Then, as you watch, a faint shimmer begins to form there—specks of light aligning into a miniature model of the very room you are standing in, complete with tiny figures that look like all of you. One of them turns its head, and you realize it’s looking at you directly.  

Feeling unsettled, you weave between strangers, brushing past snatches of laughter that echo too long and shadows that bend in directions the light doesn’t follow. You catch glimpses of the person you know—just their back, disappearing around a corner, always a few steps ahead, always unreachable.  

Finally, you find yourself pushed toward the far end of the hall, where a single door stands slightly ajar. The sound of your friend’s voice comes from the other side, calling your name warmly, inviting you in. You reach for the knob—and suddenly there is silence, and you realize you’re not sure if it *is* their voice after all.

Would you like me to keep going and bring the dream to a resolution, or keep it surreal and unresolved?
