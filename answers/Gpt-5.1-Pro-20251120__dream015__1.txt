…despite the hardships, you decide to try living like a human being instead of just surviving like an animal.

You take stock of what you have:

* A torn backpack with one good strap
* Half a canteen of water
* A rusted multitool, stiff but usable
* Three dented cans with the labels long since sun-bleached away

The wind moves lazily through the skeleton of the city, whistling through cracked windows and twisted rebar. Somewhere far off, something howls—maybe a dog, maybe not. You feel that familiar prickle of fear, the one that usually sends you scurrying to the safest dark hole you can find.

But tonight, something in you refuses to curl in on itself. Maybe it’s the way the clouds are breaking, just a little, showing a strip of sky that isn’t as gray as it used to be. Maybe it’s the dream-feeling, the sense that this world is horrible but also strangely malleable, like soft clay in your hands.

You decide to **go toward the light**.

There’s a glimmer on the horizon: not fire, not lightning, something steadier. Electric, maybe. Impossible, you think. But your feet start walking anyway, crunching glass and dust.

As you move through the empty streets, the world feels oddly tuned—sounds slightly muffled, colors too sharp. A sign hangs by one bolt, squeaking in the wind:

> WELCO E T  HO E

You pass it and feel a hollow laugh catch in your throat. Welcome to home. Yeah, right.

You cut through an alley, stepping over a faded chalk drawing on the ground—children holding hands in a ring. Their smiles are still bright, untouched by weather. You pause. For a moment, you can almost hear their voices.

And then you realize: you’re tired of walking through ghosts.

You kneel beside the chalk drawing and pull out your multitool. With the blade, you scrape at the cracked concrete until you find it: a sliver of soil in the broken seam between pavement and wall. Dark, damp, faintly alive.

A different idea takes root.

Instead of chasing the distant light, you decide to **make a place**. A claim. A stubborn, small refusal.

You spend the rest of the day scrounging:

* Broken plastic containers that can be turned into planters
* A length of tubing for catching rainwater
* A piece of bent metal that will work as a trowel

You find a crumbling rooftop with plenty of sun, protected on three sides by higher ruins. It’s high enough that most scavengers won’t bother climbing, low enough that it doesn’t sway in the wind.

Up there, you start a garden. It’s pathetic at first: handfuls of dirt pilfered from every crack in the city, scraps of dried plant matter from old parks, a few stubborn seeds you find in an overturned grocery display—beans, maybe. Or peas. The labels are gone. You plant them anyway, pressing them gently into the soil with cracked fingers.

You talk to them.

You don’t mean to. The words just spill out, quiet and shy:

“Grow, okay? Just… try.”

The air tastes different up here. There’s a scent you can’t quite place—cleaner, lighter. You tilt your head back and realize: it’s going to rain.

You set the tubing and containers in place, improvising a crude catchment from smashed gutters and a bent street sign. When the rain comes, it comes all at once: heavy, warm, and wild. You stand in it, laughing, your clothes soaked through, the world blurred into silver threads. Water drips into your containers, into your soil, into the tiny, hopeful graves of your seeds.

You drink from the canteen, then refill it with rain. For the first time in a long time, you feel something that isn’t exactly happiness but is definitely not despair.

Days pass. Or they feel like days. Time in dreams bends easily.

You defend your rooftop from scavengers—some human, some not. Once, a gaunt stranger in a patched jacket climbs halfway up the stairwell before you confront them with a pipe in your hands. You expect violence. Instead, they tilt their head, look past you at the plastic containers lined carefully along the ledge, and say, voice hoarse:

“…are those plants?”

You nod, wary.

They blink hard, eyes shining. “Can I just… look?”

You let them. The two of you stand in silence, watching the tender shoots push up through the soil, fragile and defiant. The stranger smiles like they’ve forgotten how.

“Didn’t think anything could grow anymore,” they whisper.

“Me neither,” you say. “Guess the world didn’t ask us first.”

They leave without taking anything. Before they go, they place something beside your foot: a small, carefully wrapped bundle. Inside, later, you find seeds. Different kinds this time. Someone had been saving them. Hoping.

Word spreads in that strange dream-logic way.

Sometimes people arrive at your rooftop with nothing to trade except stories. You listen. In exchange, you show them green leaves, the first pink hint of a bud, the curling tendrils that clutch at bits of wire. You see something shift in their faces—the way fear loosens its grip just a little.

Other times, people bring things:

* A cracked solar lantern that still holds a charge
* Fabric to use as shade when the sun gets too harsh
* A dented pot for boiling water and, one day, maybe soup that isn’t just from a can

You never said you were starting a community. You never declared yourself a leader. You just planted seeds.

One evening, as the sky glows an eerie orange behind the ruined skyline, you notice something strange: the distant electric light you first saw, the one you ignored. It’s closer now. Or brighter. Maybe both.

You climb to the highest point of your rooftop and wave the lantern in slow arcs. The distant light flickers twice, almost like a reply.

You’re not alone.

The realization hits you with a soft, heavy weight. Not the shock of sudden fear, but the quiet impact of understanding. There are other pockets of stubbornness out there. Other people who refused to stop trying.

A breeze travels across the rooftop, carrying the scent of damp soil and crushed leaves. Your plants rustle softly, like they’re whispering secrets to each other.

Your eyelids grow heavy. The dream thickens around you like fog. You lie down on the warm concrete between the rows of makeshift planters, staring up at a sky that, impossibly, has stars again.

As you drift, you realize something:

This world is still broken. Still dangerous. Resources are still scarce, and tomorrow might be harder than today. But in a crack in the pavement, on a rooftop garden, in the space between “too late” and “not yet,” you have done something outrageously hopeful.

You have decided to **grow**, not just endure.

The last thing you feel before you wake is a small, cool leaf brushing your hand, like someone squeezing your fingers to say:

“I’m here. Keep going.”
