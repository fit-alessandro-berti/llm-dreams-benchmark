**Dream Sequence:**

You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour—but no idea where it is. You start to panic, your heart pounding as you scan the towering skyscrapers and winding streets. The air hums with the distant murmur of voices, but no one seems to notice you.

A flicker of movement catches your eye—a shadowy figure in a long coat standing under a flickering streetlamp. They beckon you over, their face obscured by the dim light. As you approach, they press a crumpled piece of paper into your hand before vanishing into the crowd. The paper unfolds to reveal a cryptic address: *"The Clockwork Spire, 11th Floor. Don’t be late."*

You sprint through the labyrinthine streets, the city shifting around you—buildings stretching taller, alleys twisting into impossible angles. The clock tower in the distance chimes *eleven times*, and you realize with a jolt that time is slipping away.

At last, you find the towering spire, its brass gears whirring ominously. The elevator doors creak open, revealing a dimly lit room filled with masked figures seated around a long table. At the head sits a figure in a silver mask, their eyes glowing faintly. They raise a hand, and the room falls silent.

*"You’re late,"* they say, their voice echoing strangely. *"But perhaps you’re exactly where you need to be."*

The dream dissolves into a swirl of gears and whispers, and you wake with a start—your alarm blaring, the real world rushing back in.

**What happens next?** (Do you investigate the dream’s meaning? Or does the city call you back?)
