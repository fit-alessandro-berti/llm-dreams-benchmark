…despite the hardships, you decide to move toward the smoke instead of away from it.

Everyone who survives avoids smoke now. Smoke means fire, fire means people, and people mean trouble. But you’ve been alone for too long, and today, something inside you snaps in a different direction. If danger is the price of not going insane, you’ll pay it.

You shoulder your worn backpack—frayed strap wrapped in duct tape—and step off the cracked highway. The world around you is a collage of endings: cars half-swallowed by weeds, billboards peeled bare by wind, a shopping cart tipped on its side like some rusted animal skeleton. The sky has that permanent gray tint you’ve stopped trying to explain.

As you walk, the thought appears, clear and absurd:

*I’m dreaming.*

You don’t know why you think that. Maybe it’s the way time feels unhooked—how the sun seems to slide across the sky too quickly, how sounds arrive with a half-second delay. Maybe it’s because the birds have been gone for years, and yet you swear you just heard wings beating overhead.

You test it. You press your thumb hard into the palm of your other hand, like you’ve done in other dreams. It hurts. That never proves anything.

The smoke grows thicker the closer you get, a dark smear rising behind a stand of skeletal trees. You smell it now—wood, plastic, a hint of something metallic. You slip your hand to the handle of the knife at your belt. Not much of a weapon, but it’s put desperate people on second thoughts before.

You step around the last of the trees and freeze.

The smoke is coming from a building, or what’s left of one. It used to be a school maybe, or a community center: big windows shattered out, brick walls still mostly intact. A fire burns inside a half-collapsed courtyard, surrounded by a ring of stones. Above it, strung between two crumbling lampposts, is something you haven’t seen in a long time.

Lights.

Tiny ones. Little glass bulbs, some cracked, some glowing faintly. They flicker with a power that has no right to exist anymore. A cable disappears through a smashed window into the dark.

A voice breaks the silence.

“Stop right there.”

You turn slowly. A figure stands near the ruined doorway of the building, crossbow aimed at your chest. They’re wrapped in layers of scavenged cloth and leather, face shadowed by a hood. Only the eyes show: wary, sharp, very awake.

You raise your hands. “I’m not here for trouble.”

“That’s what people say right before trouble,” the figure replies. “Backpack off. Slowly.”

You unhook the strap and set the bag down. Your heart thuds loud in your ears, but under the fear, there’s that weird distance, like you’re watching this from somewhere else. A dream, you think again. Or a memory pretending to be one.

The figure studies you for a long moment, then jerks their chin toward the fire. “You alone?”

“Yes.”

They lower the crossbow a little, but don’t put it away. “Then you’re either lying or very stupid. Come on.”

You follow them into the courtyard. As you step closer to the fire, you see more signs of something impossible: a makeshift table made from a door laid across bricks, jars lined up neatly on top, piles of sorted scrap. Against one wall, a patch of earth has been cleared and boxed in with scavenged planks. Tiny green shoots poke through the soil.

A garden.

Your chest tightens. You haven’t seen new green in… you can’t remember how long.

“You did this?” you ask.

The hooded figure pulls back their hood, revealing short, uneven hair and a face weathered by sun and ash. They look younger than you expected. Older than they should be.

“Not just me,” they say. “There are others. They’re out scavenging.” They pause. “I’m Mara.”

You give your name, and the sound feels strange on your tongue, like a word from another language. Mara nods toward the lights overhead.

“Solar panels,” they explain. “Found them on a warehouse roof. Took me weeks to get them working.” There’s a glimmer of pride that cuts through their caution. “We don’t leave the lights on often—it’s a beacon. But we needed to test the batteries.”

“A beacon,” you repeat. “Is that… on purpose? Trying to draw people in?”

Mara gives you a long, measuring look. “Most days I think it’s a terrible idea,” they admit. “But what’s the point of surviving if we do it alone? We’re building something here. Or trying to.”

You look around—the fire, the garden, the jury-rigged lights, the signs of order carved out of ruin. It hits you with sudden clarity: this is the first place you’ve seen that doesn’t feel like it’s waiting to die.

“Can I help?” you hear yourself ask.

The answer comes from somewhere deeper than fear. For so long your decisions have been about staying alive *from* things. This is the first decision that feels like staying alive *for* something.

Mara blinks, surprised. “Help how?”

“Whatever you’re doing,” you say. “I can scavenge. I can guard. I know where there’s a water tank, a couple days away. Half-buried, but it might still be clean underneath the muck. I’m tired of just… wandering between empty places.”

Mara studies you again, this time not like a threat, but like a puzzle they might want to solve.

“Everyone says that at first,” they warn. “They see the fire, the roof, the walls. They think it’s safe. Then they realize staying is harder than running.”

“I’ve done hard,” you reply. “Running is harder.”

Silence stretches between you, filled with crackling fire and distant wind. Finally Mara gestures toward the building.

“You can stay tonight,” they say. “We’ll talk when the others get back. If you’re lying, you won’t make it to sunrise. If you’re not…” Their mouth twitches, almost a smile. “We’ll see.”

Inside, the building smells of dust, smoke, and something unfamiliar: soap. You walk past a hallway lined with faded murals, old announcements still clinging to corkboards, a clock stopped at 3:17. Mara shows you a room with blankets piled in one corner.

“We sleep in shifts,” they say. “Don’t go upstairs without me. Some of the floors aren’t stable.”

You nod, then hesitate. “The lights,” you say. “Outside. They feel… wrong.”

“Wrong?”

“Wrong for this world,” you say. “Too… hopeful.”

Mara snorts softly. “Hope isn’t wrong,” they say. “Just expensive.”

They leave you alone with your thoughts. You sit on the blankets, listening to the wind whistle through broken windows. The room shivers in and out of focus, like a bad connection. Something about the clock outside nagged at you—3:17. You’ve seen that number before, haven’t you? On a hospital bracelet, a street sign, a digital alarm blinking red in the dark.

You close your eyes, and the world trembles.

When you open them, you’re on the roof.

You don’t remember climbing the stairs. The panels lie in orderly rows, patched together with scavenged metal. The city stretches beyond, a jagged silhouette under the dim sky. The lights below you flicker, then steady.

Mara stands at the edge of the roof, staring out.

“You said you’re dreaming,” they say without turning. You never told them that. “Why?”

You walk to stand beside them. The drop is steep, but you feel no fear. “Because everything feels… symbolic,” you say slowly. “Like it’s trying to tell me something. The garden, the lights, even the way I found this place.”

Mara shrugs. “Maybe it is.”

“If this is a dream,” you ask, “then what are you?”

They consider that. “Maybe I’m the part of you that’s still stupid enough to think planting seeds is worth it,” they say. “Or maybe I’m just Mara, and we’re both really here, and the world ended, and you stumbled into the one corner where people are trying anyway.”

You look out over the ruins. The wind tangles your hair. Somewhere below, you hear voices returning—distant calls, the grind of cart wheels. Other survivors.

“I don’t know if I’ll wake up,” you admit. “If I do, all of this will vanish.”

Mara finally turns to you. “Tell you what,” they say. “If this is a dream, then use it. Practice choosing us instead of running. Practice building something instead of waiting for it to collapse. If you wake up…”

They tap your chest, right over your heart.

“…maybe you’ll remember how it felt.”

The courtyard below flares brighter as more lights flicker on. Someone laughs. It’s such an ordinary sound that your throat tightens.

“Okay,” you whisper. “Then I choose to stay.”

“Good,” Mara says. “Come on. The others will want to meet you. And we need to argue about where to plant the next row of beans.”

The scene blurs at the edges, colors smearing like wet paint. The cold air on your face warms, the smell of smoke softens into something else—laundry, sun, coffee. Voices become muffled, then distant, then gone.

You open your eyes.

You’re in your own bed. Ceiling cracked, but still holding. Morning light seeps around the edges of a curtain. The world outside your window is not ruined. Cars pass. Somewhere, a dog barks. A bird sings—an actual bird, sharp and cheerful.

Your heart is pounding. Your hand is pressed against your chest, right where Mara tapped you.

For a long moment you lie there, staring at nothing, feeling the leftover weight of the dream: the garden, the lights, the decision that felt heavier than any you’ve made awake.

You swing your legs over the side of the bed.

Resources are scarce in this world too, just in different ways—time, attention, kindness. Dangers are everywhere, just better dressed. But the thought settles in your mind like a seed:

*Even here, you can choose to move toward the smoke. Toward people. Toward building instead of just surviving.*

You stand up.

Outside your window, the day waits—messy, dangerous, unfinished.

Despite the hardships, you decide to step into it anyway.
