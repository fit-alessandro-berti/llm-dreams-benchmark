begin to notice that the puzzles grow increasingly intricate and surreal. Shapes shift unexpectedly, clues appear in fleeting moments, and familiar rules no longer seem to apply. Shadows on the walls whisper fragments of riddles, urging you onward. 

As you solve each challenge, the maze responds — walls subtly reconfigure, corridors stretch or contract, and shimmering doorways reveal themselves where before there were only dead ends. Your mind sharpens and expands with each solution, unlocking hidden insights and forgotten memories.

Deeper still, you sense that the maze is a reflection of your own consciousness — every twist and enigma a piece of yourself to be understood. Finally, approaching the very heart of the labyrinth, a radiant light beckons you forward. Reaching it, you recognize it as a wellspring of clarity, peace, and profound self-awareness. 

And as you step into that light, the maze dissolves around you, and you awaken — carrying with you newfound wisdom from the dream’s mysterious journey.
