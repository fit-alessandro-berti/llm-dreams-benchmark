build a community—a sanctuary where survivors can come together, share knowledge, and rebuild.

One evening, as you scavenge through the ruins of an old library, you stumble upon a hidden underground bunker. Inside, you find a dusty journal with cryptic entries about a hidden cache of supplies and a map leading to a rumored safe haven. The final entry reads: *"The key lies beneath the old clock tower, where time still stands."*

Determined, you gather a small group of trusted allies and venture toward the clock tower—a crumbling relic of the past. Along the way, you encounter hostile raiders, mutated creatures lurking in the shadows, and the haunting echoes of a world that once was.

When you finally reach the clock tower, you discover that the "key" isn’t a physical object at all—it’s a code, a pattern of light and sound left by the journal’s author. As you decipher it, a hidden door slides open, revealing not just supplies, but a network of tunnels leading to other hidden settlements.

But the reveal comes with a warning: a powerful faction has been searching for this place, and they won’t stop until they control it. Now, you must decide—do you fortify this newfound hope and prepare for war, or risk everything to find a way to restore the world before it’s too late?

What do you do?
