# The Dream Continues

...open my mouth, but no sound comes out.

I look down at my hands—they're holding a script, but the words are written in a language I don't recognize. The audience shifts in their seats. Someone coughs.

Then, strangely, I realize I don't need the script at all. The stage beneath my feet becomes soft, like sand, and I'm suddenly speaking—not in words, but in colors that float into the air like paint dissolving in water. The crowd nods in understanding, even though I haven't said anything.

A few people in the front row transform into people I know—my third-grade teacher, a friend I haven't thought about in years, someone I've never actually met. They're all smiling.

The stage begins to tilt gently, and I notice I'm not nervous anymore. I'm floating slightly above it now, still speaking my silent colors, and the audience is rising too, and we're all drifting upward together toward a ceiling made of clouds...

And then I wake up, trying to remember what it all meant.
