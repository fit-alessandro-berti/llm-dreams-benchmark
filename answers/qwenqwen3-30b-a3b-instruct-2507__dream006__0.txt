...begin to speak, but the words dissolve the moment they leave my lips. Instead of my voice, a flock of silver birds erupts from my mouth, swirling in intricate patterns like smoke from a distant fire. They don't fly away—they *rearrange* themselves, forming shimmering letters that hover just above the crowd: *"You forgot your speech."*

Panic flares. I look down at my hands—my palms are blank, empty. No notes, no outline, no scribbled reminders. I try to recall the first sentence, but my mind is a fogged mirror. Then, from the front row, a single hand rises. It’s my mother’s hand, small and familiar, holding a tiny notebook. She mouths the first line silently, her lips moving in perfect sync with a phrase I’ve never heard before:

*"The silence between heartbeats is where truth lives."*

I swallow hard. The birds stop swirling. They settle, gently, onto the edge of the stage like fragile origami. The audience leans forward, not impatient now—but *listening*, as if waiting for the next note in a song only they can hear.

I close my eyes. And this time, I speak—not from memory, but from the quiet place beneath the stage lights, where my voice has always been.

The birds don’t fly. They just *listen*, too.
