…keep moving forward, driven by an almost impossible hope: the idea of finding a place where life can begin again. The air is thick with the smell of smoke and decay, and the horizon is painted in hues of ash and dying sunlight. Your only companions are a tattered map with indecipherable markings and an old, rusting compass that barely points true north. In your pocket, a single seed rests—a relic of the world before, entrusted to you by someone you’ve lost but refuse to forget.

As you tread cautiously through the wasteland, every sound around you feels amplified: the crunch of gravel underfoot, the distant howl of wind through jagged ruins, the occasional flutter of something—someone?—just out of sight. You clutch a crude weapon crafted from scraps, alert for signs of danger. But your every step echoes with something stronger than fear: purpose.

You crest a hill, and for the first time in days, your breath catches as you glimpse a distant glow. Against the endless gray of the landscape, it shimmers faintly, almost as if the earth below is alive and breathing. Could it be? A sanctuary, perhaps? Or a trap, a ploy to lure the desperate?

Instinct tells you to proceed with caution, but something deep inside compels you forward. As the glow grows brighter, you realize it’s coming from a forest—yes, a forest. Verdant and alive, it stands like a miracle in defiance of the scorched world around it. The trees sway as though welcoming you, their leaves shimmering with an iridescent sheen, as if the light is coming from the plants themselves.

Your fingers close around the seed in your pocket. You realize this forest is unlike any you’ve known; it might be the last living one left—or something entirely new, born of the apocalypse and flourishing in its aftermath.

But as you take your first cautious steps into this new world, you hear a voice behind you. Low and gravelly, it stops you in your tracks.

“Drop the seed,” it commands.

You turn, heart pounding, and see a figure cloaked in makeshift armor, their face obscured behind a mask pieced together from shattered glass and metal. They hold a weapon—more advanced than anything you’ve seen in years—trained directly on you.

“That seed,” the stranger continues, almost reverently. “It’s not yours to plant.”

Despite your fear, you refuse to relinquish it. “Why?” you demand. “What do you know about it?”

The figure hesitates, lowering the weapon slightly. “Because that’s no ordinary seed. It’s a key. And if you plant it here, it might save this world—or destroy it.”

The air around you vibrates with a strange energy as the forest seems to lean closer, as if listening to the exchange. The ground hums faintly beneath your feet. You can sense the truth in their words, but also a choice looming before you: to trust this stranger and hand over your single thread of hope—or to plant the seed and risk whatever might come next.

What will you do?
