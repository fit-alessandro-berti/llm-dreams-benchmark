You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language you’ve never seen before—symbols that swirl and shift on the page like living things. You try to read them, but the words dissolve into mist, reappearing as images: a clock with no hands, a key that hums, a door that opens into a mirror.

As you reach for your pencil, it turns into a feather. You try to write, but your hand moves on its own, sketching diagrams of impossible machines and equations that seem to predict the future. The room around you begins to warp—walls stretch and bend, the ceiling becomes a starry sky, and the other students are now shadows, whispering in voices you almost recognize.

Then, suddenly, you hear a voice—your own, but older, wiser. It says, “The exam isn’t about what you know. It’s about what you’re willing to let go of.”

You look down at the paper again, and this time, the questions make sense. They’re not about facts or formulas. They’re about choices, fears, and the paths you’ve avoided. You realize the exam is a test of your soul, not your mind.

And as you begin to answer, the dream shifts again—this time, you’re not just taking the exam. You’re *becoming* it.
