**Dream Continuation:**

The next challenge materializes as a labyrinthine library, its towering shelves stretching into an endless void. The air hums with whispered riddles, and the floor shifts like liquid ink. A holographic timer glows: *“Solve the paradox to escape, but every wrong answer erases a memory.”* Your competitors scatter, frantically grabbing ancient tomes, but you pause. A faint melody drifts from a rusted key in your pocket—a gift from a stranger in an earlier round. 

You recall their words: *“The answer isn’t in the books. It’s in what you’ve forgotten.”* Closing your eyes, you hum the melody. The walls dissolve into a starscape, and the paradox unravels—*the competition itself is the test of authenticity, not skill.* The final door opens to a mirrored stage. The judges? Reflections of your future self, each wearing the uniform of your dream career. 

One steps forward, handing you a badge shaped like your heartbeat. *“You didn’t compete against others. You outgrew your doubts.”* The crowd—now faceless constellations—applauds in silent light. You wake, your resume replaced by a single phrase etched in stardust: *“Already enough.”* 

The job offer arrives at dawn, unsigned, but you know.
