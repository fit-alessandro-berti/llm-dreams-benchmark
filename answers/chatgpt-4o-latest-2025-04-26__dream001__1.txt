—you start to walk quickly, weaving through crowded streets that seem to shift and stretch as you move. Every building is impossibly tall, their windows glinting like watchful eyes. You pat your pockets, searching for a clue, and find a crumpled note: *"Meet at the Glass Garden before sunset."*

Panic flutters in your chest. You ask a passerby—a woman with a silver umbrella and no shadow—where the Glass Garden is, but she just smiles knowingly and points down an alley that wasn't there a moment ago.

You plunge into it, the walls pulsing with colors you've never seen before. The alley twists and spirals downward like a staircase carved out of air. You descend, feeling the minutes slipping away, when suddenly you emerge into a sunlit plaza where flowers made of crystal sway in a wind you can't feel.  

In the center of the garden stands a figure waiting for you, face hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat. You know, somehow, that they've been waiting for a very long time.

They lift a hand and beckon you closer.  

Would you like to continue the dream?
