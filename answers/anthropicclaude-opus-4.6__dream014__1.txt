feel a wave of relief wash over you as they gather around, their faces warm and open. A woman with silver-streaked hair and laughing eyes takes your hand and says, "We've been waiting for you."

Before you can ask what she means, the group begins walking, and you fall into step with them as naturally as breathing. The city around you starts to shift — the harsh neon signs soften into lanterns that float upward like jellyfish, and the concrete beneath your feet gives way to cobblestone, then moss, then something that feels like walking on the surface of still water.

Each stranger shares something with you as you walk. A tall man with paint-stained fingers hands you a key made of glass. A child gives you a word you've never heard before, but somehow you understand it means *the feeling of returning to a place you've never been*. A quiet woman in a blue coat simply walks beside you in comfortable silence, and you realize her presence alone is the gift.

The streets narrow and open into a courtyard where a massive tree grows from a fountain. Its roots drink light instead of water, and its branches hold doors — hundreds of them — each one a different color, a different wood, a different age.

"Which one is mine?" you ask.

The silver-haired woman smiles. "They're all yours. They always have been."

You reach for a door — weathered blue, warm to the touch — and when you open it, you see not a room but a feeling: the golden-hour version of every place you've ever loved, layered on top of one another like transparencies. Your childhood kitchen. A forest trail. A window seat during rain.

You step through, and the strangers don't follow, but you don't feel alone anymore. You carry them with you — the key, the word, the silence — and you understand now that being lost was never the opposite of being found.

It was the *beginning* of it.

You wake with the glass key still warm in your memory and the strange word sitting on the tip of your tongue, almost — *almost* — still there.
