...all in a language you don’t understand.

At first, you panic—flipping through the pages, scanning the symbols, the equations, the passages—none of it makes sense. The room is silent except for the scratch of pencils and the occasional rustle of paper. The clock ticks. Time is running out.

Then, slowly, you realize something strange. The words, though unfamiliar, begin to rearrange themselves in your mind. The equations twist into recognizable shapes, the letters realign. You don’t know how it’s happening, but you *understand*.

Your hand moves on its own, writing answers in a flowing script that looks nothing like your usual handwriting. The pages fill up, and when you finish, the room seems to sigh in relief. The proctor, a figure you hadn’t noticed before, Smiles—just Smiles—and the exam disappears.

You wake up with the weightless certainty that, whatever the result, you’ve passed.

(Or, if you prefer a darker twist, the last question reads: *"What is the meaning of this exam?"*—and your pencil hovers over the page as the room *watches*.)
