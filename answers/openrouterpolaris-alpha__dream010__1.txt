you start to realize the rules keep shifting.

- First challenge: “Solve the Maze.”
  You’re dropped into an office building that rearranges itself every time you blink. Doors appear where paintings were, stairwells circle back into the same floor, elevators open into forests of cubicles lit by aquarium-blue light. A disembodied voice says, “Find the room where they’re already expecting you.”

  You rush through corridors lined with people who look like former classmates and old coworkers, all typing silently. Some glance up as you pass and shake their heads like they know you’re late for something. You pick doors almost at random: one opens onto your childhood bedroom, another onto a lecture hall where everyone is taking an exam you forgot to study for, another onto an empty stage with a microphone and no audience.

  Whenever you hesitate, the walls subtly lean inward, nudging you onward.

- Second challenge: “Prove You Belong.”
  You finally burst through a door into a glass-walled conference room floating above a city at dusk. Inside sit a panel of judges, each wearing your face at different ages: 8, 16, 23, last year. In front of them: a single chair.

  “Why should we hire you for your own dream?” one of your faces asks.

  You start listing qualifications—the degrees, the projects, the overtime, the sacrifices. As you speak, the words drip out and puddle on the table, forming small paper boats that sail off the edge of the glass into the clouds below, gone.

  Another you leans forward. “That’s your résumé. Why should you have it?”

  This time, no bullet points appear in your mind. Instead you talk about:
  - moments when you lost track of time because you loved what you were doing
  - the way your chest expands when you imagine being trusted to do this every day
  - the specific people you want to help
  - the quiet, stubborn part of you that kept going even when nobody was watching

  As you speak, the room stabilizes. The city lights outside align into constellations that spell out verbs: CREATE, HEAL, BUILD, TEACH, CONNECT—whichever one matters most to you.

  The youngest version of you, with crayons still on their fingers, smiles. “Good. Next challenge.”

- Third challenge: “Accept the Cost.”
  The floor becomes a narrow bridge stretching over scenes from your life:
  - dinners you skipped
  - parties you left early
  - hobbies you let fade out without saying goodbye
  - alternate careers you might have been great at

  A host in a sparkling blazer appears, game-show style, holding two cards.

  “To win your dream job,” they announce, “you must give something up. That’s how it works, doesn’t it?” They show you:
  - Card A: Certainty. You get your dream job exactly as pictured, but everything around it becomes fixed and brittle.
  - Card B: Control. You keep moving toward that dream, but no guarantees; only alignment and effort.

  The crowd (which is suddenly there) chants for Card A. They want the neat story. But your chest tugs faintly toward Card B, even though it’s terrifying.

  When you reach for a card, the host pulls it back, eyes suddenly serious. “Are you choosing from fear, or from desire?”

- Fourth challenge: “Remember What You Wanted Before You Learned To Doubt.”
  You’re ushered into a quiet room. No judges, no cameras, no audience. Just a desk, a lamp, and an envelope with your name in your own handwriting from long ago.

  Inside is a crayon drawing (or a doodle, a rough storyboard, a made-up logo—whatever fits the life you wanted) and a single sentence from your younger self:
  
  “Please don’t make me spend my life being safe instead of alive.”

  Your throat tightens. You realize no one ever took your dream away; you’ve just been negotiating it down to something reasonable. The realization hits that the competition has always been between:
  - the version of you that believes they’re allowed to want this, and
  - the version that thinks they have to earn permission with exhaustion.

- Final challenge: “Make Your Own Rule.”
  You’re led back to a stage. Above it, a huge spinning wheel labeled:
  - Experience
  - Luck
  - Networking
  - Timing
  - Market Demand
  - Talent
  - “Who You Know”
  - “Right Place, Right Time”

  The announcer booms, “Spin the wheel to see if you win your dream job!”

  The audience roars. But you hesitate. The wheel is everything people say decides your fate.

  A small sign at the base catches your eye: “You may decline to spin.”

  The crowd starts chanting, “Spin! Spin! Spin!”

  Your heart is loud now, but clear. You step up to the microphone and say, “I’m not here to gamble for my life. I’m here to build it.”

  The boos, the cheers, the lights all blur. The dream seems to glitch, like a video buffering. The wheel slows on its own, the labels rearranging themselves into skills you can learn, people you can meet, experiments you can run. The announcer shrugs, suddenly less powerful, and fades into the background.

  A door appears at the edge of the stage. It’s plain, unlabeled, not dramatic at all.

  On the knob, tiny engraved words: “Begin Anyway.”

You walk through.

Instead of waking up instantly, you find yourself in an ordinary room—the real version of the work you want. No spotlight, no fanfare. Just:
- your tools
- a calendar with openings
- an email drafted to someone you admire
- an application half-filled
- a project outline
- a messy but possible first step

There’s a quiet certainty here. The dream job is no longer a prize someone else can give or withhold; it’s a direction plus a practice, built one unglamorous choice at a time.

As you reach for the first small task, you feel that sensation dreams rarely give: weight. The sense that this could actually be real.

Your alarm starts to ring in the distance, muffled.

You get one last clear thought before waking:

“The competition was never against them. It was against the stories that said I couldn’t start.”

You open your eyes.

If you’d like, I can now help you translate this dream into a concrete, simple plan toward your real dream job.
