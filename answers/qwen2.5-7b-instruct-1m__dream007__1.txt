wake up before things escalate further. You take a deep breath, trying to calm your racing heart. In the dream, you realize that the argument feels surreal, like it's happening in slow motion, and you're not entirely sure why it matters so much right now.

You glance around, noticing that the setting seems unfamiliar—perhaps an old classroom or a park bench where you used to meet often. The air feels thick with tension, but there's also a strange sense of detachment. You wonder if this dream is a reflection of something deeper, something unresolved in your waking life.

You open your mouth to speak, but the words feel stuck, as though they've been replaced by a heavy silence. Your friend, who looks equally confused, stops mid-sentence, clearly sensing the shift in energy. For a moment, neither of you knows what to say.

Then, in a flash, you realize that this argument isn't just about the immediate issue—it's about something bigger. It's about trust, communication, and the fear of losing each other. You look at your friend, and for the first time, you see them not as someone you're arguing with, but as a part of yourself, a reflection of your own insecurities.

The dream starts to dissolve, and you find yourself back in bed, the softness of the pillow against your cheek. You lie there for a while, replaying the conversation in your mind. In the end, you decide that the best way forward is not to win the argument but to understand each other better.

As you drift off, you feel a strange sense of peace. You know that when you wake up, you'll have to face the real-world consequences of this dream, but for now, you can let go of the tension.
