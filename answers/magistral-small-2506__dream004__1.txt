You step closer to the blank canvas, its surface shimmering with an unnatural energy, as if waiting for something. You can feel it *wanting*—not just to be painted, but to *become*.

Before you can touch it, the canvas twists in on itself, folding like origami. A single drop of liquid falls onto it—neither paint nor ink, but something alive. The moment it touches the canvas, the colors *unfold* like a blooming flower, but instead of petals, they ripple out in geometric patterns that dissolve and reform every second.

You realize the canvas isn’t just changing—it’s *feeling*. The shapes shift as if reacting to your presence. A face flickers in the swirls, then a stranger’s hand reaches out from the canvas, fingers brushing yours. The touch is cold, but electric, and suddenly, you’re *inside* the canvas.

You’re standing in a vast, ever-moving gallery where walls stretch infinitely in all directions, their surfaces alive with scenes: a city of glass melting into a desert, a forest where trees grow upside down, a crowd of people with faces made of shifting constellations. One of them turns to you and smiles with a mouth full of keys.

"You’re here," they say. "At last."

Their voice doesn’t sound like words—it sounds like a melody you’ve always known.

Then the canvas *folds again* and you wake up, still feeling the pressure of an unseen hand in yours—half a memory, half a promise.

What do you do next?
