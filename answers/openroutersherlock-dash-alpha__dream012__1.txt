You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you stand tall at the helm, salt spray whipping your face like a thousand icy needles. Lightning cracks the sky, illuminating the massive waves that rear up like vengeful giants, threatening to swallow the creaking wooden vessel whole.

"Steady now, lads!" you bellow over the howling wind, your voice a thunder of its own. The crew—grizzled sailors with eyes wide as the abyss—clings to ropes and rails, their faces pale masks of fear. Old Salt, the first mate with a scar like a lightning bolt across his cheek, shouts, "Captain, she's breakin' apart! We can't outrun this devil's brew!"

But you know better. This isn't just a storm; it's a dream-beast, alive and snarling. You grip the wheel, feeling its pulse sync with your own racing heart. "Reef the mainsail! Batten the hatches! We're not runnin'—we're divin' through it!" With a wild grin, you spin the wheel hard to starboard, plunging the ship bow-first into the heart of a towering wave.

The world tilts, water crashes over the deck like a waterfall from the gods, and for a heartbeat, everything goes black. Then—explosion of light! You burst through the crest, soaring atop the wave like a phoenix on wings of foam. The storm laughs, but weakens, parting like curtains to reveal a hidden cove aglow with bioluminescent waters and islands floating in the air, connected by rainbows.

The crew erupts in cheers as the ship glides into calm. You've tamed the dream-sea. But as you turn to them, their faces shimmer, dissolving into stars... and you awaken, the salt still tingling on your skin.
