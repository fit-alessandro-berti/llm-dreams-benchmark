You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to blend in—or risk being branded a witch, a spy, or worse, a fool from the stars. The air hums with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, and the cobblestone streets of this medieval village twist like the veins of some ancient beast beneath your bare feet. No smartphones buzzing in your pocket, no electric hum from hidden wires; just the distant clang of a blacksmith's hammer and the low murmur of voices in a tongue that's half-familiar, half-foreign—Old English laced with forgotten vowels.

You duck into an alleyway as a cart rumbles past, piled high with turnips and guarded by a mule that eyes you suspiciously, its ears flicking like judgmental flags. Your clothes—jeans and a faded band tee—feel absurdly wrong, like a neon sign screaming "Outlander!" A group of children in woolen smocks chase a hoop with sticks, pausing to gawk at you before dissolving into giggles. Hunger gnaws at your belly, a sharp reminder that dreams don't come with room service. You need food, shelter, a story to spin if anyone asks who you are.

Wandering toward the village square, you spot a tavern with a sign swinging lazily: The Wandering Goose. Inside, it's a haze of candlelight and ale-fueled boasts. A bard strums a lute in the corner, singing of knights and dragons that sound suspiciously like half-remembered Netflix binges. You sidle up to the bar, heart pounding, and muster your best archaic lilt: "Good folk, a traveler am I, lost from the king's road. Might a weary soul trade tale for trencher?"

The barkeep, a woman with arms like knotted ropes and eyes sharp as daggers, sizes you up. "Tales, eh? We've plenty. But yours'd best be gold-spun, stranger, or you'll be scrubbing pots till the cock crows." She slides you a hunk of bread and a bowl of stew that tastes like heaven's rough draft—root vegetables and mystery meat, warmed by a fire that crackles with secrets.

As the night deepens, you weave your yarn: a merchant's daughter from a distant shire, shipwrecked by tempests and trolls (close enough). The crowd leans in, roaring at your embellishments—the "iron birds" you glimpsed in your old life become harpies with wings of flame. Laughter flows like the ale, and for a moment, you forget the anachronistic itch under your skin. But then, in the rafters, a shadow shifts. Not a bat, not a rat—a flicker of something mechanical, a glint of chrome in the thatch. Your phone? No, impossible. Yet there it is, wedged like a relic from another dream, its screen cracked but glowing faintly with unread notifications from a world that's slipping away.

Panic surges. You need to retrieve it, to shatter this illusion and wake up before the era swallows you whole. Climbing the creaking ladder amid cheers from below (they think it's part of the act), you grasp the device. It buzzes to life in your hand—texts from friends, a half-eaten pizza order, the mundane pulse of 2025. But as you thumb the power button, the tavern warps. The bard's lute strings snap into guitar riffs, the stew bowl morphs into a takeout container, and the barkeep's face blurs into your roommate's, yelling about rent.

You jolt awake in your bed, sheets tangled like cobwebs, the alarm blaring a synthetic dawn. The dream clings, though— that glint of chrome in the thatch, a whisper that maybe, just maybe, you left a piece of yourself behind. Or worse: maybe it's still calling you back.
