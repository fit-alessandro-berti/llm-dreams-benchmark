I wake up in a room surrounded by an array of devices that look very much like our smartphones or tablets you use every day. The walls are adorned with strange symbols etched into the surfaces, which I can only describe as "art." The air feels thick, heavy, and comforting, making everything seem almost... safe again, despite being still in a state of suspended animation after the previous incident.

Suddenly, someone turns towards me: my name, 'Savannah.' She looks very much like my mother - petite, with curly brown hair and an effortless grace that puts off every man I meet. We exchange a brief, flirtatious smile, as if it was just yesterday we were sharing this space ourselves.

"Welcome to the party!" she booms, setting me down next to her on a raised bannister. "You must be... Savannah! How are you enjoying the new community building project?" I respond with an air of polite confusion, trying to process every single response so far.
