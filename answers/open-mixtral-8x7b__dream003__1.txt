symbols etched into the surface of the box. Suddenly, you feel a strange pull and find yourself transported to a dimly lit room filled with ancient artifacts. In the center of the room, there's an ornate table with a single key resting on it.

As you approach the table, you can't help but notice a book of matches next to the key. Curious, you strike one and hold it up to the key, revealing that it matches one of the symbols from the box. With a growing sense of excitement, you pick up the key and make your way back to the mysterious locked box.
