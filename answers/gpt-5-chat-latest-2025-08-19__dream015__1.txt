…despite the hardships, you decide to keep moving forward, determined not just to survive, but to find meaning in what’s left of the world. The sky above is a dull copper shade, rippled with clouds of ash. You walk along the fractured asphalt of an abandoned highway, broken cars resting like rusted skeletons along the shoulder. Every few steps, you hear the muffled echo of your boots in the emptiness.  

You choose to gather what little resources you can—flattened cans, bits of cloth, a cracked glass bottle that could one day carry clean water. There’s danger in every shadow; you’ve already seen scavenger bands hunting for the desperate, but worse yet are the things that don’t feel entirely human anymore.  

One evening, as the horizon burns with another blood-red sunset, you crest a hill and see something unexpected: a faint column of smoke rising in the distance, curling gently upward. That means fire—and fire means life. The thought of others both excites and unsettles you. Will they welcome you, or see you as competition?  

Still, you feel a thrum of hope in your chest. The decision is yours: do you approach the smoke, risking everything for the chance at human connection, or do you turn away, choosing solitude and safety?  

Would you like me to continue the dream with *you approaching the smoke*, or with *you walking the other way* into deeper isolation?
