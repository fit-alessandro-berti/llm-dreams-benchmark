as you move deeper into the maze, you notice the ink on the puzzle stones begins to run like wet paint. The numbers you carefully calculated drip down the walls, pooling on the ground to form reflections that look less like yourself and more like memories you thought you had forgotten.

You try to maintain your focus, to force the logic to hold, but the equations rearrange themselves into melodies. The sharp corners of the hedges soften into mist. You realize that the maze is no longer testing your intellect, but your willingness to let go of control. The path ahead stops being a corridor and becomes a bridge made of glass, suspended over a starry sky that feels oddly familiar.

At the center, there is no grand prize or final key. Instead, there is only a simple wooden door standing freely in the open space. You reach for the handle, and as your fingers touch the cold brass, the intense concentration you've been holding onto evaporates. You open the door to find your own bedroom, bathed in the gray light of early morning. You step through, the maze dissolving behind you like sugar in hot water, and you wake up with the solution to a problem you didn't know you had resting gently on the tip of your tongue.
