...gratefully accept their offer, feeling a wave of relief wash over you. They don't speak your language, but they communicate through warm smiles and gentle gestures. They lead you away from the noisy main avenue, down a narrow, cobblestone alley you hadn't noticed before.

The air grows quieter, filled with the scent of baking bread and jasmine. The strangers guide you to a small, sun-drenched courtyard hidden behind an unassuming wooden door. In the center is a fountain, its gentle burble the only sound. One of them hands you a cup of warm, sweet tea.

As you take a sip, a profound sense of peace settles over you. You realize you aren't lost at all. You are exactly where you need to be. You look up to thank them, but the strangers are gone. The teacup in your hand is now a single, vibrant yellow flower. You know, without a doubt, that you can find your way home from here. You wake up with a calm heart and a faint smile.
