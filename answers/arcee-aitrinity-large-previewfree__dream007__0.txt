The peaceful environment helps you reflect on the situation and the value of your friendship.

When you return, you approach your friend with a calmer demeanor. You acknowledge their perspective and express your own feelings without blame. Together, you work through the disagreement, finding common ground and a solution that respects both of your needs. The argument, though intense, strengthens your bond as you both learn to communicate more effectively and appreciate each other's viewpoints. The dream ends with a sense of resolution and renewed trust in your friendship.
