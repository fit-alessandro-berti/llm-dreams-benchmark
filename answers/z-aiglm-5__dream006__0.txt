...feel a sudden, strange lightness in your chest, as if your pockets are filled with helium balloons. You approach the podium, which seems to be made not of wood, but of stacked, leather-bound books that smell faintly of vanilla and old rain.

You open your mouth to deliver your opening line, but the words don't come out as sound. Instead, they manifest as shimmering, golden threads that spool out of your mouth and weave themselves into the air. The audience doesn't listen; they watch the glowing tapestry forming above their heads.

"In the beginning," the threads weave, "there was only the question."

You feel a surge of confidence that has no basis in reality. You gesture to the left, and the stage lights soften into the glow of a thousand fireflies. You gesture to the right, and the back wall of the auditorium dissolves into a rolling ocean, waves crashing silently against the seats.

You realize you aren't giving a speech at all; you are conducting an orchestra of atmosphere. The crowd begins to float, drifting out of their seats like dandelion seeds caught in a breeze, nodding in agreement with the shapes you are making in the air. You lean into the microphone to conclude, but just as you take a breath to speak the final truth, the floorboards turn to water, and you begin to sink slowly into the stage, still smiling, as the golden threads dissolve into the mist.
