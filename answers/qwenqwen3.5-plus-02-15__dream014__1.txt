...follow them down a narrow alleyway that seems to defy the city's grid, winding deeper into a quiet, sun-dappled courtyard I swear wasn't there a moment ago. The roar of traffic fades into a soft hum, replaced by the gentle sound of water trickling from a central fountain.

One of the strangers, an elderly woman with eyes that seem to hold entire galaxies, hands me a small, warm lantern. "You aren't lost," she whispers, her voice sounding like dry leaves rustling together. "You just forgot which door was yours."

As I lift the lantern, the light doesn't just illuminate the path; it reveals that the cobblestones beneath my feet are actually shifting pages of old books, and the buildings around us are made of stacked, glowing memories. The group begins to sing a wordless melody that vibrates in my chest, untangling the knot of loneliness I've been carrying. Suddenly, the fog lifts, and I recognize the architecture—it's not a strange city at all, but my own hometown, reconstructed from moments I thought I had forgotten. The strangers smile, bow slightly, and dissolve into a shower of golden sparks that drift upward, leaving me standing confidently at the threshold of my own front door, no longer afraid of being alone because I realize I was never truly separate from the world around me.

Then, the sensation of falling gently pulls me upward, and the dream begins to fade into the soft gray light of morning.
