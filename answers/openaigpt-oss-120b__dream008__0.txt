...and you stare at the glowing stack of files that hovers a few inches above the desk, each one pulsing like a tiny lighthouse. The fluorescent lights above flicker in a rhythm that matches the throbbing of the papers, and the hum of the air‑conditioner swells into a low chant you’ve heard in no other place. Your boss, Mr. Harrow, isn’t wearing his usual navy suit; instead he’s draped in a cloak of woven calendar pages, each date stamped in bold ink—today, tomorrow, yesterday—all overlapping in a dizzying swirl.

He points a skeletal finger at the highest tower of documents, a precarious spire that seems to reach the ceiling and beyond, disappearing into a ceiling of glass that suddenly turns into a river of liquid time. “You have twelve hours,” he intones, and his voice reverberates like a metronome set to a tempo only the stars can hear.

You reach for the first file, but it melts into a cascade of silver ink, spilling across the carpet and forming an intricate map of the city you grew up in—streets that bend into Escher‑like staircases, windows that open onto deserts of sand and oceans of glowing jellyfish. The coffee mug on your left begins to levitate, its surface swirling with constellations that rearrange themselves into the words “You can’t,” “You must,” and finally, “You’ll try.”

Your fingers, suddenly elongated and translucent, brush the ink‑river, pulling a strand of it up into your palm. The strand shivers, and a tiny, humming drone emerges—its body a miniature office chair with wheels that spin faster than thought. It buzzes around your head, projecting holographic post‑its that read: “Remember the deadline,” “Remember the deadline,” and the third one simply says, “Remember.”

The office walls dissolve into towering bookshelves that stretch infinitely upward, each shelf packed with volumes whose titles are the things you’ve always wanted to learn—“The Art of Pausing,” “Cooking with Light,” “How to Talk to Plants.” A soft wind blows through the aisles, turning pages on its own, and a lone cat perched on a bookshelf jumps down, its eyes a deep shade of neon green. It pads silently to your desk and drops a tiny key into the palm of your hand. The key is warm, pulsing to the rhythm of your own heartbeat.

You glance back at Mr. Harrow, whose cloak now ripples like a waterfall of deadlines, each drop a tiny deadline that splashes onto the floor and evaporates into vapor. He smiles, an expression that feels both reassuring and absurd, and says, “When you’re ready, the door will appear.”

You look around for a door, but there is none—only a thin veil of mist curling around the base of the towering file spire. The mist thickens, forming a portal that shimmers with the colors of sunrise and midnight combined. As you step toward it, the key in your hand vibrates, and a faint music starts—a lullaby you used to hear as a child, played on a silver saxophone that floats in mid‑air.

Just as your foot touches the threshold, the entire office folds in on itself, like a sheet of paper being creased into a tiny origami crane. The crane flaps its wings, and the world spins, blurs, and then—silence. You find yourself back at your desk, the stack of files now ordinary, the clock ticking normally, and Mr. Harrow looking exactly as he always does, his tie perfectly knotted.

He leans forward, his eyes crinkling with a hint of mischief, and whispers, “You’re exactly where you need to be.” The hum of the air‑conditioner fades into a gentle sigh, and your eyelids feel heavy.

And then—a soft pop, like a bubble bursting—your mind snaps back to the waking world. You’re lying in your own bed, sunlight sliding across the curtains, the lingering scent of coffee from the dream clinging to your pillow. You sit up, glance at the alarm clock, and realize you’ve forgotten to set it. The impossible deadline is still there, but now it’s just a calendar reminder on your phone, glowing in blue.

You stretch, take a deep breath, and—just as you’re about to reach for the snooze button—notice a tiny, silver key perched on the nightstand, warm to the touch, humming faintly. You smile, pocket it, and whisper to the empty room, “Okay, let’s see what else we can dream up.”
