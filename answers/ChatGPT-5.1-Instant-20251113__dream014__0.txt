…and you follow them down a narrow, lantern-lit alleyway that somehow feels quieter than the noise you left behind. As you walk, the city around you begins to shift—buildings stretch taller, their windows glowing with colors you’ve never seen, like memories you forgot you had. The strangers speak softly to one another, their voices warm and rhythmic, as though they’re humming a melody meant just for you.

One of them turns to you and smiles, the kind of smile that feels like a door opening.

“We’ve been waiting to guide you,” they say, though you’re not sure how they could have known you were coming.

You continue on together until the alley opens into a small hidden square. In the center stands a fountain made of shimmering stone. Instead of water, light pours from it, pooling at your feet. When you lean closer, the surface of the light ripples, forming an image—your path, your next step, the direction you’d been searching for but didn’t know how to name.

The strangers step back, giving you space.

“This way is yours,” another one says gently. “But you don’t have to walk it alone unless you want to.”

You take a breath. The city no longer feels overwhelming; it feels alive, welcoming, and a little bit magical. You reach out toward the glowing path—and as your fingers touch it, the warmth spreads through you like clarity.

And then you step forward, no longer lost.
