**Dream Continuation:**  
The trees begin to sway violently, their branches clawing at the sky like skeletal hands. Thunder cracks, but instead of rain, the air fills with shimmering silver droplets that hover midair, reflecting fragments of disjointed memories—a childhood laugh, a forgotten door, a whispered warning. You stumble forward, boots sinking into the earth as it softens to liquid beneath you. A hollow voice, neither human nor wind, hums: *"Find the eye before it finds you."*  

Ahead, a gnarled oak splits open, revealing a pulsing crimson light. The storm stills abruptly, and there, in the eye of the tempest, stands a figure cloaked in shadow, holding a key made of ice. Their face shifts endlessly—stranger, lover, enemy, *you*. They extend the key, and as your fingers brush it, the forest dissolves.  

You wake with a gasp, your palm tingling. The scent of petrichor lingers.
