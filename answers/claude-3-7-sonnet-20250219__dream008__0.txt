You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel your heart racing as panic sets in. The stack of papers on your desk seems to grow taller by the second, defying physics.

You try to speak, to explain that the timeline is unreasonable, but your voice comes out as a whisper. Your boss doesn't seem to notice your distress and simply walks away, expecting results by tomorrow morning.

As you begin working, you notice the office transforming around you. The walls stretch farther away, the ceiling grows higher, and your desk begins to shrink. Your computer keyboard feels tiny beneath your fingers, yet somehow the screen is impossibly far away.

Colleagues walk past, but when you call out for help, they either don't hear you or their faces blur when they turn toward you. The clock on the wall spins wildly - sometimes forward, sometimes backward.

You open a drawer to find supplies, but instead discover it contains an endless dark tunnel. From somewhere deep within, you hear the distant sound of ringing phones and typing keyboards.

Suddenly, you remember a solution to the project - a brilliant idea that will save everything! You reach for a pen to write it down, but it melts in your hand like ice cream on a hot day. You try to memorize the idea instead, repeating it over and over, but with each repetition, the words jumble and lose meaning.

The office lights flicker, and for a moment, you're standing in a completely different building - perhaps a school from your childhood? But before you can make sense of it, you're back at your desk, the deadline now somehow only minutes away.

You look down at your work and realize you've been writing in a language you don't understand. The symbols shift and change as you stare at them...

Then you wake up, the alarm clock buzzing beside you, with an odd sense of relief mixed with lingering anxiety about the day ahead.
