You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to **run, your heart hammering against your ribs like a trapped bird. The streets stretch endlessly before you, choked with towering, glass-fronted buildings that seem to lean inwards, their reflections distorting the sky into fractured shards of twilight. The air hums with an oppressive silence, broken only by the frantic thudding of your own footsteps and a distant, discordant chime that echoes from unseen towers.**

Your phone, clutched tightly in your sweating palm, offers no solace. The screen is a swirl of indecipherable symbols – maps that shift and dissolve, contact lists that blur into smudges, and the time, glowing relentlessly: **58:17... 57:43... 56:58...** Each digit flip sends fresh spikes of adrenaline through you.

You scan the architecture desperately. The buildings are monolithic and alien, their surfaces shimmering like oil slicks in the fading light. Neon signs flicker erratically, spelling out words that twist and writhe before your eyes – "Rendezvous," "Convergence," "Threshold" – each one feeling both promising and utterly meaningless. Pedestrians drift past, their faces obscured by shadow or featureless masks, moving with an eerie, purposeful slowness that contrasts sharply with your panic. No one seems to see you, or if they do, they offer no help, merely gliding through the distorted crowds like silent ghosts.

You duck into a narrow alleyway that smells of damp stone and ozone. Here, the city sounds warp – the distant chime becomes a low, thrumming vibration under your feet, amplified by the canyon walls. You lean against a cold, sweating wall, gasping for air. You try to think, to recall *why* the meeting is important, who you're meeting, but the details slip through your fingers like smoke. All you have is the crushing weight of the deadline.

Suddenly, a flicker of movement catches your eye. Halfway down the alley, seemingly formed from the interplay of shadows and reflected neon, a door materializes. It’s old, made of dark, heavy wood bound with tarnished iron, and it looks utterly out of place amidst the modern monoliths. A single, flickering lantern hangs above its lintel, casting a warm, inviting glow that feels like an oasis in the sterile strangeness.

Driven by a desperate intuition, you stumble towards it. The handle is cold under your hand. You push. It swings open silently, revealing not another alley, but a cramped, softly lit elevator car. Inside, a single button glows a serene gold. Without hesitation, you press it. The doors slide shut with a soft sigh, and the elevator begins to rise, not smoothly, but with a lurching, dream-like motion that makes your stomach drop.

The numbers on the display beside the button don't count floors; they seem to count down: **59:00... 58:15... 57:30...** Matching the countdown on your phone. The walls of the elevator are mirrors, but they don't reflect you clearly. Instead, they show fragmented images: a glimpse of a bustling market square, a towering library with shelves that vanish into darkness, a conference room filled with shadowy figures seated around a long table. Each image flashes and dissolves as the elevator ascends.

The chime from outside returns, louder now, resonating within the small space. Finally, the display hits **00:01**. The elevator stops with a gentle bump. The doors slide open.

You find yourself not in an office building lobby, but in a vast, circular chamber bathed in a diffuse, warm light. The walls are lined with shelves, but not with books – they hold intricate, glowing mechanisms, crystalline structures, and objects that seem to defy easy description. The air hums with a low energy. Seated around a large, circular table in the center are the shadowy figures you glimpsed in the mirrors. They turn as one, their faces still obscured, but their presence is palpable – expectant, ancient, and strangely familiar.

One of them raises a hand. The voice that comes is not spoken, but formed directly in your mind, calm and resonant: **"You are late."** The chime echoes once more, sharp and final.

You wake with a start, heart still pounding, the phantom taste of ozone thick in your mouth. The alarm clock blares: 7:00 AM. The important meeting? It was just a dream... wasn't it? You glance at your phone. No missed calls. No calendar reminders. Yet, the memory of the circular chamber and the waiting figures lingers, unsettling and profound.
