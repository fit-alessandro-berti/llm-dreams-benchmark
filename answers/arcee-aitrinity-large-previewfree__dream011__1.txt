You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language you don’t recognize. Panic sets in as you realize you’ve never studied this language, and the clock is ticking. The room around you begins to shift—walls dissolve into a vast library filled with books in every language imaginable. A figure appears, cloaked in shadows, and hands you a single book. It’s titled *The Language of Your Soul*. As you open it, the words transform into your native tongue, and the questions on the exam begin to make sense. You realize the exam isn’t about memorization or technical knowledge—it’s about understanding yourself and your purpose. The answers flow effortlessly, and as you finish, the figure nods approvingly. The library fades, and you wake up, feeling a profound sense of clarity about your path forward.
