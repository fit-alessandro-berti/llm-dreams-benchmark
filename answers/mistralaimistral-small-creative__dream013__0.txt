**The Dream Continues…**

You step forward, the air thick with the scent of old parchment and something faintly metallic—like the tang of a freshly struck match. The walls of the maze shift subtly around you, their surfaces no longer just stone but layered with shifting symbols: geometric patterns that pulse with a dim, bioluminescent glow, as if the maze itself is breathing. The deeper you go, the more the puzzles seem to *watch* you, their mechanisms humming with anticipation.

### **The First Threshold: The Mirror of Fractured Time**
Ahead, the path splits into three identical corridors, each lined with mirrors. But these are not ordinary reflections. The left mirror shows you as you were years ago—smaller, hesitant, your eyes wide with a question you’ve long forgotten. The center mirror distorts your image, stretching your limbs like taffy, your face melting into something both familiar and alien. The right mirror, however, is still. Too still. When you step closer, your reflection *doesn’t move*. It stares back, unblinking, and then—slowly—lifts a hand to press against the glass from the *other side*.

A voice, neither yours nor anyone else’s, whispers in your mind:
*"Which one is the lie?"*

You reach out. The moment your fingers brush the center mirror, the glass *rips* like wet paper, and you’re pulled through—

### **The Second Chamber: The Bridge of Whispers**
—into a vast, circular room suspended over an abyss. The floor is a narrow bridge of black stone, no wider than your feet, and beneath it swirls a void filled with murmuring voices. They’re not words, not exactly—more like *echoes of thoughts*, fragments of conversations you’ve had, arguments you’ve lost, secrets you’ve kept. Some sound like your own voice. Others belong to people you’ve known, or perhaps only dreamed of.

At the far end of the bridge stands a door, its surface etched with a single, shifting equation:
**∞ = 1 + ∑ (dreams you’ve forgotten)**

A figure kneels at the door’s base, their back to you. They’re humming a tune you recognize but can’t place. When they turn, you see it’s *you*—older, wearier, with eyes that hold the weight of a thousand unsolved riddles. They smile, but it doesn’t reach their eyes.

*"You’re almost there,"* they say. *"But the last puzzle isn’t in the maze. It’s in you."*

They press a hand to the door. The equation *clicks*, rearranging itself:
**You = ∑ (choices you’ll never remember making).**

The door swings open.

### **The Final Hall: The Puzzle of the Unwritten End**
Beyond the door, the maze dissolves into a vast, empty library. The shelves stretch into infinity, filled with books whose spines bear no titles—only dates, times, and coordinates that shift when you try to read them. At the center of the room is a single table, and upon it lies a puzzle box. It’s made of a material that feels like bone and glass, its surface carved with a labyrinth that mirrors the one you’ve just walked.

As you pick it up, the box *whispers*. Not with words, but with *sensations*—the ghost of a hand on your shoulder, the taste of rain on your tongue, the sound of a name you’ve never spoken aloud. The lid slides open on its own, revealing not a treasure, but a key. It’s small, ordinary, the kind that might fit an old diary or a music box.

A voice—your own, but older, softer—fills the room:
*"You’ve been here before. You’ll be here again. The maze doesn’t end. It only* **remembers** *you."*

The library begins to fade, the shelves dissolving like smoke. The key grows warm in your palm. Somewhere, a door you can’t see *clicks* open.

And then—

---
**How does the dream end?**
Do you:
1. **Turn the key in the lock of your own mind**, unlocking a memory you’ve buried—or a future you’ve yet to live?
2. **Drop the key**, and watch as the maze *rewinds*, pulling you back to the beginning with a new puzzle waiting?
3. **Whisper the name of the figure from the bridge**, and see the library transform into something else entirely?
4. **Wake up**—but find the key still in your hand, warm and real, when you open your eyes?

*(Or suggest your own ending!)*
