…feel the weight of every set of eyes on your back like the spray of cold water. You plant your boots, wrap your hands around the soaked wheel and steady your breath. The wind howls through the rigging, ropes snap taut, and for a heartbeat the ship feels like a living thing straining to flee. You bark orders over the thunder—“Reef the main! Lash down the barrels! Keep her nose to it!”—and your voice surprises you with how calm it sounds.

Between flashes of lightning you can see nothing but angry, rolling walls of black water, but somewhere deep in your gut you know there is a way through. You remember charts you've studied, storms you've weathered before. You refuse to let the panic in your chest dictate your hands. The crew moves, frantic and precise, responding to your confidence like a flock to its leader.

Then, in that strange way dreams have, the scene tilts. The ship rises on the back of a wave so high you can see over the jagged horizon. In the heart of the storm there is a circle of stillness, a dark, glassy eye. You turn the wheel toward it. The roar drops away, the rain hangs in the air like beads of glass, and your crew's anxious faces soften.

The calm is so total it feels like stepping into another world. You look down and realize the wheel beneath your hands is no longer wood but smooth, warm stone. The sea around you is no longer water but a field of tall grass waving in a phantom wind. Your crew are children, friends, old strangers; they smile, waiting.

You close your eyes, take one last breath, and when you open them again, the ceiling of your bedroom replaces the stormy sky. Your heart is still beating fast, pillow damp with sweat. But the feeling of gripping that wheel, of steering through chaos to the quiet center, lingers with you as the morning light creeps in.
