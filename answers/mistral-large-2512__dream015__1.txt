**The Last Garden**

You wake to the scent of damp earth and rust. The air is thick with the weight of survival—every breath a reminder that the world has moved on without you. The sky is a bruised canvas of purples and grays, the sun a pale smudge behind perpetual haze. You’re in a ruined city, its skeletal buildings clawing at the heavens like the fingers of the dead. But something is different today.

A sound.

Not the usual groans of collapsing infrastructure or the distant howls of scavengers, but something softer. A *drip*. You follow it, your boots crunching over broken glass and the brittle bones of long-forgotten things. The sound leads you to a cracked subway tunnel, its entrance half-buried under rubble. Inside, the darkness is absolute—until your eyes adjust.

There, in the hollowed-out shell of what was once a station, something *grows*.

A garden.

Not the wild, thorn-choked tangles of nature reclaiming the world, but something *tended*. Rows of green push through the concrete, their leaves trembling in the dim light filtering through a collapsed ceiling. Tomatoes, heavy and red, dangle from vines. Carrots peek from the soil like orange secrets. A single sunflower, impossibly tall, tilts toward the light, its face a golden promise.

And then you see *her*.

A woman—no, a girl, really—kneels in the dirt, her hands buried in the soil. Her clothes are patched and stained, her dark hair tied back with frayed twine. She doesn’t look up as you approach, but her fingers pause, just for a second, as if she’s sensed you. Then she goes back to her work, plucking a weed with the precision of someone who has done this a thousand times.

“You’re not supposed to be here,” she says, voice rough but not unkind. “This place is hidden for a reason.”

You open your mouth to speak, but the words stick in your throat. How do you explain that you’ve been wandering for months, that your last meal was a rat you caught in a trap, that the sight of something *alive* and *growing* feels like a miracle?

She finally looks up. Her eyes are sharp, assessing. “You’re hungry.”

It’s not a question.

Before you can answer, she plucks a tomato from the vine and tosses it to you. You catch it, the fruit warm in your palm. The first bite is like a revelation—sweet, juicy, *real*. You don’t realize you’ve closed your eyes until you open them again to find her watching you, a small, knowing smile on her lips.

“Who are you?” you ask.

She wipes her hands on her pants. “Name’s Lina. And this?” She gestures to the garden. “This is the last thing keeping me alive. And now, maybe you too.”

A shadow passes over the tunnel entrance. Lina’s smile vanishes. She grabs your arm, pulling you deeper into the green. “We’re not alone,” she whispers.

From the darkness beyond the garden, a voice rasps—*human*, but wrong. “Found you.”

Lina’s grip tightens. “Run.”

And just like that, the dream shifts. The garden is no longer a sanctuary. It’s a trap. The things hunting you aren’t just scavengers—they’re *hungry*. And they’ve been waiting for someone like you to stumble in.

The last thing you see before the darkness swallows you whole is Lina’s face, lit by the dim glow of a single flickering bulb, her eyes wide with something you can’t name.

Fear? Regret?

Or the terrible, beautiful weight of hope?

**Would you like to continue the dream?**
- **Fight your way out** (but the garden might not survive).
- **Bargain with the hunters** (but what do they want?).
- **Let Lina lead you deeper into the tunnels** (but where do they go?).
- **Wake up** (and wonder if any of it was real).
