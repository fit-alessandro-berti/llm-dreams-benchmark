Absolutely. Let’s complete the dream together—step by step, as if we're wandering through the city together, breath by breath.

---

You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to walk—footsteps echoing in silence—on a street made of shimmering, silver tiles that shift like liquid underfoot. The air hums with a quiet, melodic chime, like wind through glass bells. Towering buildings rise—not of stone or steel, but of woven crystal and living vines, pulsing gently with soft internal light.  

At first, you feel disoriented. No signs. No maps. Just the hum and the shifting streets. But as you walk, the city begins to *recognize* you. A child with star-shaped eyes stops and hands you a small, glowing compass that doesn’t point north or south, but instead rotates to match your heartbeat.  

*“The meeting,”* the child whispers, *“is where your shadow stops following you.”*  

You freeze. Your shadow, until now, has always trailed behind. But as you step forward, the shadow stretches, wavers, and then—suddenly—pulls away, curling into a thin, spiraling shape that floats just above the ground, like a flame without fire.  

You follow the shadow’s path. It leads through a marketplace of floating lanterns, where merchants sell dreams in silver vials and memory in folded paper. One vendor hands you a ticket: *“One hour. If you meet yourself, the meeting begins.”*  

The sky above begins to change—the clouds form shapes: a clock, a key, a hand reaching out. And then, beneath the great bridge of suspended music, you see a door. It's made of woven silence, and it’s open. No hinges. No handle.  

You step through.  

Inside is a room carved from mirrors—each reflection shows a different version of you. One is calm, one is angry, one is laughing, one is crying. And in the center, a single chair sits facing a blank wall.  

A voice—not from any speaker, but from within the air itself—says: *“The meeting isn’t with a place. It’s with the truth of your absence. What are you running from?”*  

You stop. For the first time, you don’t know where you’re going. You don’t need to.  

Because the meeting wasn’t about a building, a time, or a title.  

It was about *remembering*—remembering what you left behind when you left the real world behind.  

And now, you understand: the city wasn’t a place.  

It was a dream you’d buried—of being unafraid, of being seen, of being truly *you*.  

You take a deep breath. You smile.  

And as the clock on the wall begins to tick backward, you realize—this was never really a dream.  

It was your memory of a life you almost lived.  

And now, you wake up—on your porch, with a cup of tea, and the sun just rising.  

But in your hand, you still hold the compass.  

And it’s spinning gently.  

With a soft *click*, it points directly at the door of your old apartment.  

You smile.  

You're going to the meeting.  

And you won’t need to find it.  

You’ve already been there.

How does that feel?  
Would you like to explore another part of the dream—like what happens after the meeting, or what the child looked like, or what the shadow really is?  

Or perhaps dive into a memory from the real world that sparked this vision?  

I’m right here with you, in the dream. 🌌
