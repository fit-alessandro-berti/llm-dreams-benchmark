…follow them through a narrow side street that seems to slip between the loud buildings like a hidden seam.

At first you’re wary—because in dreams, help can turn sharp without warning—but their voices are calm, their hands open, their pace matched to yours. One of them notices you keep glancing up at the skyline as if it should explain itself. “You’re trying to navigate by the tallest things,” she says gently, “but you don’t live up there.”

They lead you into a small shop that shouldn’t exist: a quiet place behind glass fogged with rain, lit by warm lamps, smelling faintly of paper and citrus. The sign outside reads **MAPS**, though you don’t remember passing it before. Inside, the shelves hold atlases, but also stranger items: folded-up subway lines that hum softly, city blocks stitched together like quilts, a compass that points not north but *toward whatever you’re avoiding*.

A man behind the counter looks up as if he’s been expecting you. He doesn’t ask for your name. Instead, he asks, “Where were you trying to get when you started pretending you weren’t going anywhere?”

The question lands in your chest with a dull, familiar weight.

Before you can answer, the kind strangers spread out around a table and begin unfolding something. Not a paper map—something thicker, alive with detail. As it opens, the city rearranges itself: streets untangle, alleyways widen, dead ends soften into small staircases. You see the spot where you first felt lost. You see how you began walking faster, hoping speed could substitute for direction.

The woman points to a simple dot on the map. “Here,” she says. “This is where you are.”

You lean closer. The dot pulses like a heartbeat.

“And this,” says another stranger, tapping a faint line like a thread, “is where you keep going in circles.”

Your throat tightens, but not from fear. From recognition.

The man at the counter slides a small card toward you. It’s blank until you touch it, and then words appear in your own handwriting:

**ASK FOR WHAT YOU NEED.**

You almost laugh. “I don’t even know what I need.”

“That’s okay,” the woman says, and her kindness doesn’t feel like pity—just clarity. “You can start smaller.”

She places three objects on the table:

- a key labeled **HOME**  
- a match labeled **COURAGE**  
- a coin labeled **TIME**

“Pick one,” she says. “Not the one you *should* pick. The one your body reaches for first.”

Your hand hovers. The city outside continues roaring, but it sounds farther away now, like weather. You don’t think. You just choose.

The moment your fingers close around it, the map brightens. A path rises from the page, a thin ribbon of light that threads through the city—not the shortest route, but the truest. It winds around places you’ve been avoiding: a bridge you never cross, a park where you once waited too long for someone, a café where you felt seen and then left before the feeling could root.

“Do I have to go alone?” you ask, surprised by how quiet your voice is.

“You don’t have to,” says one of them. “But you do have to go.”

They walk you back outside. The bustling city is still there—cars, voices, neon, impatience—but it’s no longer a wall. It’s just movement. The strangers don’t push you forward; they simply stand with you at the curb while the light changes.

Across the street, the ribbon of light begins again, hovering just above the pavement like a line only you can see.

The woman presses something into your palm: not a phone number, not an address, but a small folded paper. When you open it, it’s a single sentence:

**IF YOU GET LOST AGAIN, RETURN TO YOUR BREATH.**

You look up to thank her, but the group is already dispersing into the crowd, as if they were never separate from it at all. For a flicker of panic, you start to chase them—then you remember the sentence in your hand.

You stop.

You inhale.

The city’s edges sharpen in a way that feels like waking, but you’re still dreaming. The ribbon waits. You take one step, then another, and the feeling of being lost doesn’t vanish so much as *move to the side*, making room for something steadier.

As you follow the path, you notice something else: people’s faces soften when you pass, as if they recognize you from another version of this dream. A busker’s song syncs with your footsteps. A traffic signal blinks in a pattern that feels like encouragement. The city is no longer a maze trying to trap you—it’s a map learning your name.

At the end of the ribbon of light, there’s a door you’ve walked past a hundred times without seeing. It has no knob, just a small indentation shaped exactly like the object you chose in the shop.

Your hand lifts.

You press it into place.

The door opens—not into an apartment, not into a street, but into a quiet room filled with morning-colored light. On the far wall is a window looking out over the city, and for the first time you can see it without needing to conquer it.

On a table sits a simple notebook, open to a blank page. A pen rests beside it, waiting.

And as you step inside, you realize the dream isn’t asking you to find your way through the city.

It’s asking you to decide where “way” begins.
