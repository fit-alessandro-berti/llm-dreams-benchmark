**The Dream Continues:**

The air hums with an electric charge, thick with the scent of rain-soaked cobblestones and something metallic—like old coins or the faint tang of ozone before a storm. The city stretches endlessly in every direction, a labyrinth of towering spires and crumbling tenements, their facades shifting subtly when you blink. The sky is a bruised violet, streaked with veins of gold that pulse like a living thing.

You check your wrist—no watch. Your pockets are empty except for a single, cold key on a rusted ring, its teeth jagged and uneven. The key doesn’t fit anything you can see. A whisper slithers past your ear: *"It’s not for a door."* You turn, but there’s no one there.

Ahead, a clocktower looms, its face cracked and bleeding numbers. The hands spin backward, counting down to zero. You sprint toward it, but the closer you get, the more the streets warp—buildings fold like origami, alleyways split into mirror versions of themselves. A woman in a moth-eaten coat steps from a shadow, her smile too wide, her eyes black pits. *"You’re late,"* she murmurs, pressing a folded map into your palm. When you unfold it, the paper is alive with veins of ink, shifting into a constellation of symbols. One glows: a spiral staircase descending into darkness.

You follow it.

The stairs don’t end. They spiral into a vast, candlelit chamber where the air thrums with voices—hundreds of them, overlapping, speaking in tongues you almost understand. At the center stands a figure wrapped in tattered robes, their face obscured by a mask of shifting gears. *"The meeting is already here,"* they say, voice like grinding metal. *"But you’re the one who was supposed to bring the key."*

The gears in their mask whir, and suddenly you’re not in the chamber anymore. You’re back on the street, but the city is different—cleaner, brighter, the clocktower now a pristine white obelisk. A man in a sharp suit extends a hand. *"Ah, there you are. We were beginning to worry."* His cufflink is the same key from your pocket, but now it’s whole, its teeth forming a perfect, tiny lock.

The meeting starts. The room is filled with people you’ve known all your life—your childhood self, your future self, a stranger who looks exactly like you but is smiling. They’re all holding hands, forming a circle. The man in the suit taps a gavel (also the key) and says, *"The rules are simple: you must choose. The lock opens one of three doors. Behind the first is everything you’ve ever wanted. Behind the second is everything you’ve ever feared. Behind the third… is the truth about why you’re here."*

You reach for the key.

And you wake up—

—**gasping**, your hands clenched around the sheets, the dream’s weight still pressing on your chest. On your nightstand, a single key lies beside your alarm clock. Its teeth are smooth now, polished to a mirror shine. And on the wall above it, faint as a ghost, the outline of a spiral staircase glows in the dark.
