…symbols that seem to move when you blink, like constellations rearranging themselves across a night sky. The lines glow faintly under your fingertips, and when you trace one of them, the box hums, a soft vibration rising through your hands and into your chest.

The room around you shifts. The walls melt into mist, and suddenly you are standing in a vast field under a violet sky. The box is lighter now, almost weightless, and the patterns on it begin to spin like a tiny galaxy. With each turn, the hum deepens until it feels like a heartbeat. You realize the key isn’t something to find — it’s a rhythm to match. You tap your fingers against the box, and the patterns sync with your pulse.

A seam appears. The lid opens without a sound, and inside is a small mirror that doesn’t reflect your face. Instead, it shows a memory you didn’t know you still had — a childhood afternoon, a laugh, a voice calling your name. The moment swells, blooming into warmth that wraps around you. As you reach toward it, the mirror dissolves into light, pouring out of the box like water.

The light lifts you gently upward, and just before it becomes too bright to see, you hear a whisper: “You already had the key.” You wake with your heart still humming and the faint impression of that intricate pattern lingering in your mind, like a map you almost remember how to read.
