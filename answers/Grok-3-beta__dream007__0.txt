step outside to cool off. The air is crisp, and the night sky stretches endlessly above, dotted with stars that seem to pulse with a quiet intensity. You take a deep breath, feeling the tension in your chest loosen just a fraction. Your friend follows you out, quieter now, their footsteps soft against the pavement. For a moment, neither of you speaks—just standing there, letting the silence settle like a third presence between you.
Then, the ground trembles. It’s subtle at first, a low rumble you feel more than hear, but it grows into a shudder that rattles the streetlights and sends a flock of birds scattering from a nearby tree. You glance at your friend, their eyes wide with the same unspoken question: What’s happening? Before you can say anything, the sky shifts—those pulsing stars rearrange themselves, forming jagged, unfamiliar constellations that twist and writhe like living things.
A voice—not yours, not your friend’s—cuts through the air, deep and resonant, coming from nowhere and everywhere. “The argument is meaningless,” it says. “Look up.” You do, and the constellations resolve into a vision: a vast, spinning wheel of light and shadow, threads of fate weaving through it, connecting you, your friend, and something much larger. The fight—whatever it was about—dissolves in your mind, replaced by an overwhelming sense that you’re both part of this strange, cosmic tapestry.
Your friend grabs your arm, grounding you as the trembling stops. The stars fade back to normal, and the voice is gone. You turn to each other, the anger replaced by something unspoken—wonder, maybe, or understanding. “Did you see that too?” they whisper. You nod, and without another word, you both head back inside, the dream shifting as dreams do, leaving the argument behind like a forgotten thread in the wheel.
