*the dream shimmers and takes shape around me*

...I decide to **follow the sound of running water**.

It's distant—a whisper beneath the wind that scrapes through hollow buildings. My feet crunch on glass and ash as I move through what was once a city square. A rusted carousel lists to one side, its painted horses frozen mid-gallop, their eyes knowing something I don't.

The water grows louder. I push through a tangle of vines that have reclaimed a collapsed overpass, and I find it: a stream cutting through concrete, impossibly clear, fed by some underground spring that didn't get the message about the end of the world.

There's a child sitting at the edge. She's building something—stacking smooth stones into a small tower with intense concentration. She doesn't look up.

\ always fall,\ if we've been mid-conversation. \ I keep building them anyway.\eel beside her. The water is cold when I touch it. Real.

\?\

She finally looks at me. Her eyes are old. \ else would we do?\

I pick up a stone and add it to her tower. It holds.

Somewhere behind us, I hear others approaching—footsteps, voices, the particular sound of people who've chosen to keep going.

*The dream wavers, waiting to see what I'll do when they arrive...*
