...written in a language you’ve never seen, glyphs unfurling like vines across parchment that smells faintly of rain. You blink, and the letters rearrange themselves into your own handwriting, but they’re asking things you don’t know how to name: “Calculate the weight of a promise.” “Show your work for the distance between who you were and who you pretend to be.” “Circle all answers that forgive you.”

A clock on the wall ticks, but its hands move like the tide, leaning forward, sliding back, leaving salt and glitter in their wake. Everyone else around you is confidently scribbling with pens that purr like cats. You raise your hand to ask for another pencil and the proctor, who has your mother’s eyes and your dentist’s smile, whispers, “No tools allowed, only what you brought.”

You look down and realize your backpack is full of seashells, a loaf of unsliced bread, and a single red mitten. The seashells hum when you hold them to your ear. Maybe that’s a hint. You press one to the test paper, and the glyphs soften, begin to speak: “Name a time you were brave and didn’t notice.” You write down a night you walked home in the rain, the way you laughed when the lightning made brief cities in the sky. The ink doesn’t write; it grows, delicate as moss.

A question asks you to “Find x, where x is the door.” You glance at the classroom door; it’s breathing. So is the window. So are you. The ceiling tiles are a patchwork of maps. You pick the one with a dotted line, and your desk skims forward like a raft. Suddenly the classroom dissolves into a hallway made of every corridor you’ve ever walked down—hospital halls, school halls, the aisle of a plane, a supermarket frozen food aisle at midnight. You realize each fluorescent hum matches a question number. You follow question 12, the sound of bees in a jar, until it opens into an auditorium where the stage curtain is a gigantic eyelid.

On stage, your childhood goldfish, now the size of a moon, glides across a blackboard. It wags its tail and the stars rearrange: “Prove that you belonged even before you earned it.” You don’t know the proof, but you remember the feeling of being held, the way your name sounded when someone who loved you said it softly. You write that down. The fish nods, as though approving a theorem.

You’re running out of time, and the clock has melted entirely into a puddle that reflects a sky you don’t recognize. The last section says, “Extra credit: Draw the moment you decided.” You don’t remember deciding. You draw two hands: one empty, one holding a seed. You shade the space in between until it looks like a doorway, and then you step through.

The exam room returns, but it’s outside now, desks planted in a meadow of tall grass. The proctor sets a stamp on your paper; it leaves a thumbprint shaped like a small, bright sun. “You may turn in your questions,” they say—not your answers, your questions—and suddenly that feels right. You stack them carefully: the ones about love, the ones about fear, the ones about who gets to say you are ready.

You stand to hand it in. Your chair sighs and grows roots. Your shoes are damp with dew. When you look back at the test, your name has changed into a path. You follow it out of the classroom that isn’t a classroom, into a morning that smells like oranges and printer ink and warm stone, and the door closes without closing at all. Somewhere behind you, a bell rings that might be a bird. Ahead, your career is a lake, asking, as gently as it can, if you’d like to learn to swim.
