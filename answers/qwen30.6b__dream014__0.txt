The city buzzed with life as I clutched my satchel, feeling more lost than ever. Suddenly, a group of strangers emerged from the fog—a mix of neon-lit vendors, hunched figures laughing, and a young woman holding a basket with a heartwarming message. “We’re just friends who need help,” she said, her voice a warm melody. She led me through the city, her kindness a beacon amid my emptiness. As I finally found my way, the dream ended with a smile lingering at my feet, a quiet understanding that even in life’s chaos, there’s always the chance for connection.
