symbols etched into its surface, glowing faintly as if alive. The patterns seem to shift when you touch them, rearranging themselves into shapes and fragments of some forgotten language. A soft hum emanates from within the box, resonating in your chest like a heartbeat. You feel inexplicably drawn to it, as though it knows something about you that you don’t.
