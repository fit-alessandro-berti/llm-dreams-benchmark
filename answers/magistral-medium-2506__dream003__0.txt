symbols etched into the surface. Suddenly, the box begins to glow faintly, pulsing with an otherworldly energy. A whisper seems to drift from its depths, though no lips move—just a voice murmuring in a language you don’t recognize, yet somehow understand.

Your fingers trace the patterns, and one symbol—an eye with a crescent moon—burns against your touch. The box shudders, then clicks open on its own. Inside lies not treasure or danger, but a mirror… yet it doesn’t reflect you. Instead, it shows a version of yourself in a distant place—somewhere vast and unfamiliar, like a desert under twin suns. The reflection reaches out, palm pressed against the glass, as if waiting for you to do the same…

Do you touch the mirror? Or do you slam the box shut?

*(How would you like the dream to unfold? I can weave it into something surreal, terrifying, or hopeful!)*
