...plant a garden in the cracked fuselage of a fallen airplane.

You don't know why. It makes no practical sense—water is rationed, the soil is toxic, and winter comes hard and fast in this new world. But in the dream-logic that guides your hands, you find yourself dragging bags of black earth through the skeleton of what was once a city, until you reach the silver beast half-buried in rubble. Its wings arc toward the gray sky like a prayer or a warning.

Inside, the seats are gone, cannibalized long ago for fires and shelter. You line the floor with scavenged plastic sheeting, fill the hollows with dirt carried in a rusted helmet. You plant seeds you found in a dead woman's pocket—sunflowers, their shells still smooth and black as obsidian.

Days blur. You guard your absurd crop with a sharpened rebar while raiders pass by outside, their footsteps crunching on broken glass. They don't look inside. Perhaps the plane is invisible to those who aren't dreaming. Perhaps you are becoming invisible too.

Then, on the morning when the air tastes like copper and ozone, they bloom.

But these are not sunflowers. The stalks grow translucent, filled with moving light like slow-motion lightning. The faces of the flowers turn toward you—not yellow, but mirror-bright, reflecting not your face, but versions of you that might have been: one wearing a suit you've never owned, another old and laughing, a third made of smoke and starlight.

You realize, with the certainty that only comes in dreams, that you haven't been growing flowers at all. You've been growing doorways.

The petals begin to open wider, humming with a frequency that makes your teeth ache. Through the gaps, you can see green—real green, the kind that doesn't exist anymore, fields that roll on forever under a sun that hasn't been filtered through dust clouds.

You gather your pack. It contains only the seeds you didn't plant, a canteen of dirty water, and a photograph of people you can't quite remember.

The flowers sway, inviting. Outside, you hear the distant howl of something hungry approaching through the ruins.

You step forward, and—

*You wake up with dirt under your fingernails and the taste of pollen on your tongue, wondering if you should check the old airport after all.*
