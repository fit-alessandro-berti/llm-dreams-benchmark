feel an irresistible urge to paint. As soon as your fingers graze the canvas, colors begin to flow—not from any brush or tube, but from your own hands. Swirls of cerulean blue and honey gold spiral out, shaping themselves into floating staircases and dancing bridges. Each step you take onto the canvas becomes real beneath you, solidifying with each footfall.

Music you can't quite hear vibrates through the air, and with every note, the sky overhead shifts its hues—from peach blossom pink to magnetic indigo. Out of the corner of your eye, you see the colors in the distance swirl into the shapes of friendly, ever-smiling creatures. One beckons to you, offering a paintbrush with a bristle made of shimmering light. When you accept, the landscape responds to your thoughts: trees bloom into laughter, rivers flow upward, and words you’ve always wanted to say appear in the air, woven from silvery script.

The canvas expands as you move forward, and you realize you’re not just painting the world—you’re dreaming it into being, limited only by your imagination and your willingness to explore.
