you drift from cluster to cluster like a balloon on a slow leak. Each group seems halfway through a conversation you recognize only by its rhythm: laughter like champagne flutes clinking, nods like metronomes. You catch phrases that sound familiar and then tilt, revealing they’re not: a woman in a sequined dress talks about growing tomatoes on the moon; a man with a lapel pin shaped like a violin insists his dog speaks three languages, but only in the mornings.

Someone offers you a small plate of something that looks like geometry—triangles of pear, circles of cheese, cubes of shadow—and when you put one in your mouth it tastes like an old song you can almost name. You ask if anyone’s seen the person you’re looking for, but their names slip away when you reach for them, like soap in bathwater. “Just missed them,” people say, delighted, apologetic, distracted, all at once.

You try to stand on your toes to see over heads. The ceiling is a sky that’s been ironed flat, hung with lamps like pale moons at different stages of remembering. Your shoes keep changing: sandals, skates, bare feet, then shoes that feel like someone else’s idea of feet. A waiter passes balancing a forest of glasses and whispers to you without moving his mouth, “They’re by the window,” and when you turn, every wall has grown a window, and every window opens onto a different version of outside: snow falling upward; a city of umbrellas; a meadow where a door swings in the wind with no house attached.

You recognize your friend’s laugh in a group clustered near a window showing a shoreline of paper boats. You move toward it, but the floor has turned into carpeted sand, and your steps make soft shushing sounds, like a librarian calming the ocean. Along the way you’re pulled into a conversation about the proper etiquette for shaking hands with a storm. “Firm, but flexible,” says a woman whose earrings are tiny hourglasses. “And never mention thunder’s mother.”

You nod as if this is something you’ve always known. The man beside her is giving an impromptu speech about a painting he can’t see. He raises a glass and it’s full of dawn. He gives it to you; you sip and feel a bright warmth in your chest, the sudden certainty that you are very close, that your friend is turning toward you right now.

A child appears, holding a balloon that contains a smaller, darker party inside it—miniature people clinking miniature glasses. The child asks, “Have you met the hosts?” You realize you haven’t seen the hosts, and for a second you worry you were supposed to bring something, a gift, a story, a passport. The child points to a pair of portraits on the far wall. They’re painted so well they seem to look back at you. One winks. The other sighs. The sigh lifts a breeze that carries the smell of rain-soaked pavement and the sound of the person you’re seeking saying your name from another room, the syllables scattering like silver coins.

You follow the sound through a set of double doors that open into the same room, only now the furniture is arranged in how-you-remember-it order. Music from a piano you can’t see is playing a tune you learned to hum while brushing your teeth when you were eight. People you’ve never met greet you by your childhood nicknames. A man offers you a coat that is your grandfather’s laugh; a woman asks you to hold her plum while she finishes telling the end of the story she began in your last dream.

There—there they are. The outline of the person you know, across a small lake of conversation, a warm shape that immediately rearranges the furniture of your breathing. You raise your hand; they tilt their head, as if listening for the whistle you never learned to make. The crowd swells. Someone starts a toast that takes the form of a staircase. People step onto each sentence and ride it up. You step on too, rising slowly to eye level with chandeliers that are suddenly filled with birds preening crystal from their feathers.

“Hey!” you call, and the word becomes a flock. It wings toward them, scattering confetti you can almost read. For a second you’re sure you share an eye, a brief corridor of attention, and your name returns to you with the weight of a hand on your shoulder, and then—

The power flickers. The birds go still. The piano forgets its next note. Your shoes are a little lake and your socks are small boats. The group you’re in turns all at once and becomes a single person with many sleeves, and they say, “We were just talking about you,” in a tone that is both welcome and warning. They smile, and their teeth are tiny envelopes. They hand you one. Inside is a map of the room drawn by someone who loved you once. There is a red X where you are.

“Your friend’s in the garden,” says the map, and a door you hadn’t noticed opens to a night that has been waiting patiently. You step outside and immediately the noise softens to the shape of crickets, and the party’s light becomes a soft, warm rectangle on the grass. The garden smells like fresh pages. Fireflies drift, rearranging themselves into words that keep meaning different things—hello, follow, remember.

Under an arbor of sleeping roses, your friend is sitting on a bench, their face turned up to the sky as if it has just said something surprising. You go to sit beside them. Up close, their presence is so familiar it feels like a mirror you forgot was there. You think of everything you could say, and instead you both look up at the stars, which are not stars but tiny windows into other rooms where other gatherings are happening, and through one of them, you glimpse yourselves from far away, two figures at the edge of a party, at the center of a world.

“Did you find me?” they ask, not turning.

“I kept almost finding you,” you say, and both of you laugh quietly, the kind of laugh that puts chairs back where they belong.

After a while, your friend takes your hand, and your palm is stamped with the date of a day that hasn’t happened yet. “We should go back in,” they say, “before the cake runs out.” You both stand. The garden path curves like a sentence leading you home. At the door, you glance back. The fireflies have spelled out your name correctly this time.

Inside, the party has shifted again, but now it’s arranged around the space you make together. People smile and step aside as if this was the plan all along. The waiter appears with two plates, and the cake is exactly the flavor you were hoping for and couldn’t remember.

A band you never saw set up starts playing your song, the one you used to wish you had, and everyone is dancing in a way that feels like forgiving. You dance too, not well and not badly, but honestly, hand in hand, and you are finally, completely certain that you’ve found them, and that you were always going to.
