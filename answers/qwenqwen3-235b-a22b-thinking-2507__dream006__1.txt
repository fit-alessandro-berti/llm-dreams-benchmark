You step onto the stage, the spotlight blindingly hot on your face. Your notes flutter from suddenly-sweaty palms, scattering like frightened birds across the polished floor. Panic claws up your throat—you *forgot* the speech. The words dissolved the moment you stood up.  

The audience’s expectant faces blur into a single, terrifying entity… until you notice something strange. **Their skin is made of paper.** Delicate, yellowed parchment, some crisp and new, others frayed at the edges. Whispers rustle through the crowd like turning pages. One woman’s cheekbone creases as she leans forward, her smile splitting like a torn sheet. A man’s brow furrows—a deep, deliberate crease forming a question mark on his forehead.  

*They’re origami.*  

Your heart hammers. If they’re paper… maybe they *understand* silence.  

You close your eyes, letting the fear flow *through* you instead of fighting it. You step to the edge of the stage, not to speak, but to **kneel**. With trembling fingers, you pick up a single fallen page—*your* page, blank and trembling in your hand. You smooth it gently on the floor. Then, slowly, you begin to fold.  

A crane. Simple, imperfect. The rustling of the crowd softens. Paper eyelids blink. Paper hands, jointed with careful creases, reach toward you. You place the tiny crane in the palm of a front-row child’s paper hand. It shudders, then *flutters*—a real, living origami crane taking flight, circling the hall.  

One by one, the audience unfolds.  
Paper suits bloom into origami trees.  
Dresses become fluttering paper butterflies.  
Ties twist into soaring paper kites.  

The stage is no longer a stage—it’s a forest of folding paper, whispering in the wind of a hundred wings. You stand barefoot on cool, smooth wood (no more spotlight, just dappled moonlight), holding the last folded page: **an empty book with a feather for a bookmark.**  

You wake up smiling, your pillow damp not with sweat, but with the memory of ink-tears that became rain.  

*(And on your desk, a single paper crane rests beside your alarm clock—still damp, still breathing.)* 🕊️
