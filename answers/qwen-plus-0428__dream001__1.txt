You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panic, your heart pounding in your chest as you try to remember any landmarks or signs that might have been in the city before. The streets are empty, the buildings are tall and glassy, and the air smells faintly of old stone and something else—something metallic, like the scent of a forgotten machine.

You take a deep breath and try to focus. Maybe there's a park or a marketplace nearby? Or perhaps a bridge that leads to a quieter part of the city? Your mind races, but your memory is foggy, like a half-remembered dream. You step forward, uncertain, and soon find yourself standing at the edge of a large, circular plaza surrounded by towering spires.

The plaza is filled with people, all dressed in strange, flowing garments, their faces obscured by masks. A group of figures in black robes approach you, their movements deliberate and quiet. One of them speaks in a voice that seems both calm and commanding.

**"You are not meant to be here."**

You freeze, your throat dry. The weight of the words presses down on you, making your vision blur for a moment. Then, a hand gently touches your shoulder, and you're pulled back into the dream, the city fading behind you like a dream.

You wake up, soaked in sweat, your heart still racing. The meeting has passed, and you’re left wondering where you’ve gone—and whether you’ll ever find your way back.
