…written not in words, but in shifting constellations of light. As you lean closer, the first “question” reveals itself:

---

## Question 1  
A single star pulses softly in the center of the page. Surrounding it are dozens of empty orbits. In each orbit, a tiny symbol blinks into being for a fleeting second before vanishing. You sense that you must capture the right sequence of symbols—though you have no idea what they mean.

---

Your heart hammers. You reach out one trembling finger… and the star responds, brightening until it fills your vision with kaleidoscopic color.

---

## Question 2  
When the brilliance recedes, you find yourself staring at a door painted on the desk. The door has no handle—only a riddle etched in liquid silver:

> “To open me, you must first close your eyes.  
> Then speak the memory that once made you cry.”

You hesitate. A wave of childhood sadness washes over you, raw and unexpected. You press your palms against your eyelids and whisper the first sorrow that comes to mind—a rainy afternoon spent lost in the woods. Behind your closed lids, the painted door swings inward.

---

## Question 3  
Beyond the “door,” the exam paper dissolves into mist, and letters rise like smoke. They rearrange themselves into a single sentence hovering in the air:

> “Define yourself, but do not use any words you know.”

Now the test isn’t about facts or formulas. It’s about essence. You struggle to imagine identity without language—your name, your hopes, your fears, all slipping between your grasp. Then, instinctively, you close your eyes again and feel for something more primal: the echo of your heartbeat, the taste of your own breath. In that silence, you draw a shape on the desk with your fingertip—an unbroken spiral that radiates outward.

---

## Question 4  
The spiral ripples until it transforms into a mirror. In its glassy surface you see yourself—and something else: a faint silhouette, smiling, beckoning you forward. Underneath the reflection, letters appear:

> “You have one choice: continue forward into the unknown…or turn back, and keep the life you’ve planned.”

You swallow hard. The choice feels colossal, final. All the ambitions you’ve labored toward—dream jobs, titles, security—stand behind you. But ahead lies a path you can’t yet name. Your pencil trembles as you write your answer on the desk in the same glowing script as the riddle:

> “I choose the path I cannot yet imagine.”

---

Suddenly, the desk vanishes. The classroom walls melt away into starlit space. You drift free among galaxies of possibility, weightless and unafraid. A soft voice echoes through the void:

> “Congratulations. You have passed the final exam.”

And in that moment, you awaken—heart racing, certainty blossoming in your chest…realizing that in the dream’s surreal test, you discovered something far greater than any career path: the power to choose yourself, unknown and magnificent.
