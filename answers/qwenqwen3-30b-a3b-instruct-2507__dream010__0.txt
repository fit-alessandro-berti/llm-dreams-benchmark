...unexpected allies. The final challenge unfolds in a towering, whispering library made of living wood—its shelves curling like vines, books floating mid-air, their pages fluttering with unseen winds. You're told to find the *"Truest Purpose"* scroll, hidden among a labyrinth of knowledge.  

But every time you open a book, it recites your deepest fears: *"You're not good enough," "They'll find out you're pretending," "This isn't real."* The air grows heavy with doubt.  

Then, a small, silver-eyed fox materializes from a book’s spine. It nuzzles your hand, murmuring, *"The answer isn’t in the words. It’s in the silence between them."*  

You close your eyes. The library fades. You’re not searching anymore—you’re *listening*. And in the quiet, you hear it: the faint rhythm of your own heartbeat, steady and sure.  

Suddenly, the fox’s image shimmers. It’s not a fox at all—it’s your younger self, holding a sketchbook filled with drawings of your dream job: a quiet studio where you teach children to paint with sunlight, write stories with paper airplanes, and turn mistakes into art.  

The fox (your younger self) smiles. *"You forgot to believe in yourself. But I never did."*  

The library dissolves. You stand before a glowing portal. The voice of the competition announces: *"The prize is revealed. Your dream job—the one you’ve always wanted—is not a place, but a choice. *You* are the teacher."*  

You wake with tears on your cheeks—and in your hands, a real pencil, already drawing the first line of a new story.  

The dream wasn’t about the prize. It was about remembering *you*.
