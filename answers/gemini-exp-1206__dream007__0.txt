... settle it the only way we know how: **a dance-off, judged by a panel of highly opinionated squirrels.**

The argument, as far as I can recall in this hazy dream-state, was about whether pineapple belonged on pizza. I was vehemently pro-pineapple, a culinary hill I was willing to die on, while my friend, bless their misguided soul, was a staunch anti-pineapple purist. It had escalated quickly, as these things tend to do when matters of such grave importance are involved.

Suddenly, the familiar living room where we were shouting melted away, replaced by a clearing bathed in the dappled sunlight of a fantastical forest. Giant, luminous mushrooms sprouted from the mossy ground, casting an ethereal glow. A makeshift stage, constructed from fallen logs and woven vines, stood in the center.

And then there were the judges. Four squirrels, each more distinguished and judgmental than the last, sat perched on miniature toadstools, their tiny paws clasped in front of them. One, with a monocle perched precariously on its nose, seemed to be the leader. Another, sporting a bright red bowtie, nervously twitched its tail. The third was a portly squirrel, who kept stuffing his cheeks with acorns, while the last, a sleek, grey squirrel, seemed to be meticulously sharpening its tiny claws with a twig.

My friend and I, still seething with righteous indignation, stood on opposite sides of the stage. A hush fell over the clearing, broken only by the rustling of leaves and the occasional, judgmental squeak from the squirrel judges.

Then, the music began. It wasn't any song I recognized, more a symphony of rustling leaves, chirping birds, and the rhythmic thump of distant, giant footsteps. It was a primal beat, a call to unleash the fury of our culinary convictions through the language of dance.

I moved first, my body channeling the tropical sweetness and tangy zest of the pineapple. I leaped and twirled, a whirlwind of vibrant energy, each move a defiant argument in favor of this delicious fruit's place on a pizza. I was a human pineapple, a dancing embodiment of deliciousness.

My friend countered with a rigid, almost robotic style, each movement sharp and precise, reflecting their belief in the sanctity of a traditional pizza. They stomped and pointed, their body a visual representation of the "NO PINEAPPLE" doctrine they so rigidly adhered to.

We danced like our lives depended on it, two contrasting styles clashing on the wooden stage. Sweat dripped from our brows as we poured every ounce of our being into our performance, the fate of pineapple on pizza hanging in the balance.

The music reached a crescendo, a flurry of movement and emotion. I finished with a dramatic flourish, landing in a pose that, I hoped, screamed "pineapple supremacy!" My friend, panting and equally exhausted, ended their dance with a rigid, defiant stance.

Silence. We held our breath, our eyes fixed on the squirrel judges. The monocle-wearing squirrel adjusted his eyewear and, in a surprisingly deep voice for such a small creature, declared, "This is a most... *unusual* case. The passion... the commitment... it is quite... **overwhelming!**" He turned to consult with his fellow judges, a flurry of hushed squeaks and whispers ensuing.

The tension was unbearable. What would the squirrels decide? Would they be swayed by my tropical grace, or my friend's traditional rigidity? The fate of pizza, nay, the fate of *my* pizza toppings, hung in the balance, held captive in the paws of four furry, opinionated judges... and then...

... I woke up, drenched in sweat, my alarm clock blaring. The taste of pineapple lingered strangely on my tongue, and I had a sudden, inexplicable urge to order a pizza. But with or without pineapple?  The squirrels, unfortunately, hadn't gotten around to telling me. The dream, and the answer, remained frustratingly incomplete. And I swear, I saw a squirrel outside my window, staring at me with an unnervingly judgmental gaze... or maybe I was still dreaming.
