You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and pause, drawn to its silent, infinite potential. The air hums with possibility as you reach out, and the moment your fingertips brush the surface, the canvas *sings*—a sound like wind chimes made of glass and starlight.  

It is not paint you see, but *living light*: swirls of aurora borealis bloom into fractal patterns, then dissolve into liquid gold that flows like a river across the canvas. Shapes emerge—winged serpents, doorways to nowhere, constellations that pulse with your heartbeat. You realize the canvas is not passive; it is *listening*, translating your unspoken thoughts into form.  

A voice, neither male nor female, echoes from the canvas: *"What do you long to unmake?"* You hesitate. The world around you begins to blur, the ever-shifting colors bleeding into the edges of the canvas, as if the dream itself is dissolving into the art. You dip your hand into the liquid light and pull forth a shape—a key, perhaps, or a wound, or a memory you’ve forgotten.  

The canvas trembles. A portal opens at its center, swirling with the hues of your deepest fears and desires. You feel the pull of it, the promise of answers, of transformation. But as you step closer, the voice whispers again: *"Every creation is a door. Will you walk through?"*  

The dream holds its breath, waiting.
