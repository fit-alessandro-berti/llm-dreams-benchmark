**...decide to plant a garden in the shadow of a broken skyscraper.**

It seems insane, when the wind tastes of ash and the nearest neighbors are mutated scavengers, but I can’t keep running. The dust is trying to bury me, so I stop. I kneel on the jagged concrete, tearing away the hard, dry crust of the world with trembling hands, until I find a trace of moisture deep in the soil. 

With a rusty spoon I found in a hollowed-out skeleton, I dig a small hole. I don't have seeds, not really—not yet—but I have memories. I press a handful of dried, blackened beans into the earth, my heart hammering in my chest. 

I pour the last few sips of my canteen onto them. It’s a sacrifice, but as I sit back and watch the grey, cracked soil drink it in, the noise of the world fades. The howling wind and distant screams blur into a hum. I am not just surviving anymore; I am creating. And as long as there is a green shoot pushing through the dust, the world is alive.
