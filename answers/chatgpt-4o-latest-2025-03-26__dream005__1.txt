they’re all speaking in different languages—none of which you can fully understand. Some are whispering, others laughing loudly, their voices blending into a surreal hum. The room is dimly lit, but golden light spills from chandeliers above, casting soft halos over everyone’s heads. As you move through the crowd, the floor beneath you seems to pulse softly, as though the building itself is breathing.

You pass a group dressed in formal wear from another era—Victorian suits and flowing gowns—engaged in an intense chess match where the pieces move on their own, leaping across the board. A man in a mirror-polished monocle nods at you solemnly, as if he recognizes you.  

You keep going, unsure of your destination, until you spot your friend—or at least, you think it’s them—standing in a doorway at the far end of the room. But when you try to get closer, the distance between you seems to stretch. Every step you take only makes the hallway grow longer. 

Someone brushes past you and presses a note into your hand. You unfold it: “Don’t trust the reflection.” Startled, you glance at a nearby ornate mirror and see yourself—but your reflection is smiling when you are not.

What do you do?
