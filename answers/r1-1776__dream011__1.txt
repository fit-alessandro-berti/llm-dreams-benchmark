You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language you don’t recognize—shifting symbols that twist like smoke on the page. The first question morphs into a riddle: *"What did you abandon to get here?"* Your pen trembles as memories flash—a forgotten hobby, a strained relationship, a childhood dream.  

The next question materializes not on paper but in the air, glowing faintly: *"How do you measure regret?"* Before you can react, the exam hall dissolves. You’re now standing in a vast library filled with mirrors, each reflecting a version of yourself at different crossroads in life—some triumphant, others desolate. A clock on the wall ticks backward, and the floor beneath you cracks like thin ice.  

Panicked, you grab a mirror shard to write your answer, but it bleeds ink that pools into a dark ocean. Voices of teachers, family, and friends churn in the waves: *"You’re running out of time."* Suddenly, the exam booklet floats by, its pages blank except for one phrase: *"Choose your question."*  

You wake with a gasp, the taste of saltwater on your lips, your alarm blaring. The sun slants through the blinds. For a moment, you’re unsure if the exam was a dream—or if today is the dream.
