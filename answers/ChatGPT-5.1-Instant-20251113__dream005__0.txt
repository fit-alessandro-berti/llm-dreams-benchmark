…each group seems to be in the middle of a conversation you feel you *should* understand, but the words slide away like water when you try to focus.

One circle of people laughs uproariously at something you didn’t hear. When you step closer, they turn toward you in perfect unison, smiling politely but expectantly—as if you’re supposed to deliver a punchline you don’t remember learning. Before you can say anything, someone taps your shoulder.

You turn, but no one is there.

Farther ahead, a different cluster of guests is gathered around a table covered in objects that look vaguely familiar: a key that feels warm when you pick it up, a postcard from a place you’ve never been yet somehow recognize, a feather that glints like metal. They invite you to choose one. When you reach for the postcard, they nod with solemn approval.

The postcard’s picture shifts in your hand. First it shows a quiet street at dusk, then a sunlit field, then finally a crowded room—this room. And in the corner, half-hidden behind a pillar, is the one person you know.

You look up. The pillar is across the hall, but now the crowd seems to thicken, people drifting into your path even as they pretend not to see you. You try weaving through them, but the space stretches and contracts as if you’re walking through a dream made of rubber.

Then someone steps into your way: a stranger holding a tray of drinks. Their eyes are kind but knowing.

“They’re waiting for you,” the stranger says, tilting their head toward the pillar. “But you have to decide what you want to say when you find them.”

The room hushes. The postcard in your hand grows heavy.

And the crowd parts, leaving a clear path—straight toward the person you came here for.
