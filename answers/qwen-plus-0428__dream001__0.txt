You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panic, your heart racing as you try to remember any landmarks or signs that might have been familiar from your waking life. You glance around, taking in the towering buildings, narrow alleyways, and the hum of distant traffic. The air is thick with the scent of rain and something else—something electric, almost alive.

You step forward, hesitant, and notice a strange glowing sign at the edge of a street. It flickers faintly, casting an eerie light across the pavement. Your pulse quickens as you approach it, curiosity overriding your fear. The sign reads: **"The Convergence."**

You follow it, stepping into a shadowy tunnel beneath the city, where the lights dim and the world becomes a blur of color and sound. As you walk, the city seems to shift around you—buildings twist, streets curve, and the sounds of the city become a symphony of echoes. You feel a strange pull, as if the city itself is guiding you toward something unseen.

Then, you see it—a massive structure at the center of the city, a towering spire of glass and steel, its surface shimmering like liquid light. At its base, a large circular platform stands, surrounded by ancient symbols carved into the stone. The air here is different—charged, humming with an energy you can’t quite name.

You step forward, feeling the weight of the moment. This is it—the place where everything changes. You reach out, and the symbols glow brighter, their light pulsing in rhythm with your own heartbeat. You feel a surge of clarity, a sense of purpose. You are not just going to the meeting—you are *here*.

You take a deep breath, and the city begins to shift around you again, folding back on itself like a living thing. You are no longer in the city. You are in the meeting. And you are ready.
