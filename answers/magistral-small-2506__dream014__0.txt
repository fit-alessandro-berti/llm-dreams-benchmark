accept their help with gratitude. As they lead you through the city, they share stories of their own journeys—some funny, some poignant—and you realize that everyone around you is carrying their own invisible burdens. The city, once overwhelming, now feels alive with shared humanity.

One of them points to a small, hidden garden tucked between skyscrapers. "Sometimes," they say, "you just need a quiet place to remember who you are." The garden is peaceful, filled with flowers and a bench where you can sit. For the first time in a while, you feel at ease.

As night falls, they invite you to a nearby rooftop where they gather to watch the stars. Someone brings out a guitar and starts playing, and others join in with their voices. The city hums below you, but up here, you feel connected to something greater.

In the dream, you understand that being lost isn’t about the place—it’s about finding the right people to walk with you for a while. When you wake up, you carry that warmth with you, knowing that kindness and connection are always waiting to be found.
