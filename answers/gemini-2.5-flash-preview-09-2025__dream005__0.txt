You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and...

...the first group blocks a wide, marble staircase. They are dressed entirely in various shades of gray, speaking in low, reverent whispers about the optimum trajectory for a discarded paper airplane. I try to push past, mumbling an apology, but their conversation instantly turns to me:

“Are you adequately weighted?” one man asks, his glasses catching the low light.

“For what?” I ask, feeling suddenly heavy, as if my pockets are full of wet sand.

“The trajectory, of course,” a woman replies, holding a miniature, perfectly folded piece of parchment. She taps my shoulder and the whisper intensifies, forming a low, humming drone that fills my teeth. They do not seem to possess actual faces, only approximations of earnestness. I manage to slip around them just as they begin measuring the angles of my shadow.

The search leads me into a brightly lit conservatory where the air is thick and smells powerfully of rain and polished wood. The next group is gathered around a single, massive clock that has no hands. They are laughing in sharp, brittle bursts—laughter that sounds exactly like breaking glass. They are all wearing identical, oversized silver rings.

I spot a profile that looks vaguely familiar—it could be the person I know, Sarah—but as I approach, the figure turns, and it is merely a mannequin wearing Sarah’s distinctive lavender scarf. The laughter instantly stops.

“You’ve arrived at the wrong hour,” one woman states, tilting her head. She holds up a sheet of music written entirely in numbers.

“Where is Sarah?” I ask, my voice sounding weak and high against the silence.

“She left a directive,” a small man announces, stepping forward. He gestures toward a large, sealed jar on a nearby pedestal. Inside the jar, a single goldfish swims in circles. “You must correctly guess the fish’s name before the lights change.”

The lights, which have been steady white, start to shift rapidly through impossible colors—chartreuse, burnt orange, a pulsating shade of electric blue. I stare at the fish, feeling the pressure mount. *Marcus? David?* The fish looks strangely judgmental.

Finally, I blurt out the first thing that comes to mind: “It’s called *The Missing Cord*!”

The lights stop instantly on a deep, velvety black. The group cheers in sudden, deafening applause.

The darkness collapses the conservatory walls. I am no longer inside; I am standing on a narrow, polished wooden dock that stretches far out over an inky, motionless sea.

At the very end of the dock, there is a single chair facing away from me. Seated in the chair is the person I know.

I walk toward them quickly, relieved, but as I draw closer, I realize they are exceptionally small—like a perfectly rendered doll. They don’t move.

When I reach the chair, I reach out and turn the figure around.

It is not Sarah, or Marcus, or anyone I know. It is my own face, frozen in a look of profound, dull disappointment. The miniature figure holds a small, tightly rolled scroll in its lap.

I carefully pick up the scroll and unroll it. The message is written in my own familiar handwriting, but it makes no sense.

***

*The key is in the forgetting, but the lock requires butter. Wait for the sound of the fourth bell, or perhaps the seventh.*

***

As I read the last word, the motionless sea begins to heave. The dock beneath my feet dissolves like sugar in tea, and the tiny figure of myself floats away, still looking disappointed. I try to hold onto the message, but the paper turns to foam and drifts up, up, until it settles against the ceiling of my bedroom, dissolving into the texture of the popcorn plaster just before I open my eyes.
