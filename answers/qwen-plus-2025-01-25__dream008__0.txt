feel a wave of pressure washing over you. The room seems to grow quieter, as if the world is holding its breath, waiting for your next move. You glance at the clock on the wall—it ticks louder with each passing second, mocking the tight timeline set before you.

You turn to your colleagues for help, but they seem distant, absorbed in their own tasks or avoiding eye contact altogether. Your boss stands nearby, arms crossed, watching intently. Their expression is unreadable, but there's an underlying expectation that weighs heavily on your shoulders.

As you sit down at your desk, the project brief materializes in front of you—a thick stack of papers filled with intricate diagrams, complex instructions, and vague requirements. It’s overwhelming, almost like it’s written in a language you only partially understand. You flip through the pages quickly, trying to make sense of it all, but every page reveals more questions than answers.

Suddenly, something strange happens: the documents begin glowing faintly, and words start rearranging themselves right before your eyes. Deadlines shift, numbers change, and new sections appear out of nowhere. You try to focus, but the text keeps slipping away, refusing to stay still long enough for you to grasp its meaning.

Desperate for clarity, you stand up and walk toward your boss, hoping to ask for guidance. But as you approach them, their form blurs, morphing into someone else entirely—someone familiar yet unrecognizable. They smile faintly, then hand you another document, this one even thicker than the first. "This will explain everything," they say, their voice echoing strangely.

Confused but determined, you return to your desk, spreading out both sets of documents. As you pore over them, patterns begin to emerge. Shapes form from the chaos of letters and numbers, revealing hidden meanings. A map? A code? Or perhaps...a puzzle?

Just as you think you're close to understanding, the lights in the office flicker ominously. Shadows stretch unnaturally across the walls, and whispers fill the air—soft murmurs urging you to hurry, warning you that time is running out. The clock now ticks faster, each tick louder than the last, until it feels like a countdown to some unknown catastrophe.

Your heart races as you work feverishly, piecing together fragments of information. Slowly, a solution begins to take shape in your mind. But just as you’re about to present your findings, the dream shifts...

And you wake up, gasping for air, clutching a pen tightly in your hand, realizing the impossible deadline was never real—but the feeling of urgency lingers, lingering like an afterimage burned into your consciousness.
