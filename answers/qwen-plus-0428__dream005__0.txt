You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and **feel the weight of their presence**, each one more intimidating than the last. You glance around, trying to spot the person you know — but they’re not there. You glance again, then again, and again. The room is crowded, filled with laughter, clinking glasses, and the hum of conversation. You feel like an outsider, lost in a sea of strangers.

Then, a voice breaks through the noise. “Hey, stranger.” You turn, and there they are — your only friend from high school, the one who always seemed to know everything. They smile, and for a moment, it feels like everything is okay. But as they speak, you realize the truth: this is not just a dream. It’s a *reality*.

And you’re not alone.
