scramble to gather your materials, but as soon as you reach for your laptop, it morphs into a thick, ancient book filled with indecipherable symbols. Your boss stares at you expectantly, tapping their foot. 

Panicked, you flip through the pages, hoping to find something useful, but the words start shifting and rearranging before your eyes. The letters detach from the paper and float around you like fireflies. You try to grab one, but it slips through your fingers like mist.

The office around you begins to dissolve, the walls stretching into an endless hallway lined with doors. Your boss is still there, but they seem unaware of the change. They repeat, "The deadline is now," their voice echoing strangely.

You choose a door at random and push it open, only to find yourself in a completely different world—one where your coworkers are seated at their desks, but they’re all wearing masks, their faces hidden. They type furiously on keyboards that aren't connected to anything.

Then, the strangest part: You look down at your hands, and they are not your hands anymore. They're made of glass, reflecting the shifting lights of the dreamscape. 

And then you hear a voice—your own, but distant—whispering, **"Wake up before it’s too late."**

What do you do next?
