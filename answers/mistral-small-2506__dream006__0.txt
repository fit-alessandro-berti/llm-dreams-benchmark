speak with confidence, your voice steady and clear. The words flow effortlessly, as if guided by an unseen force. The audience leans in, captivated by your every word. Suddenly, the stage beneath you begins to tremble, and the lights flicker wildly. The crowd gasps as the walls of the auditorium dissolve into swirling mist, revealing a vast, star-filled sky. You realize you’re no longer on a stage but floating in the vastness of space, your speech now a cosmic whisper carried by the wind of distant galaxies.

The stars around you rearrange themselves into familiar shapes—faces from your past, symbols from forgotten dreams. A voice, both yours and not, echoes through the void: *"You’ve been speaking to the universe all along."* The dream shifts again, and you find yourself standing in a quiet, sunlit meadow, the speech now a memory, the audience gone. A single book lies open on the grass, its pages blank. You reach for it, and as your fingers touch the paper, the words of your speech appear, glowing faintly, as if written by the dream itself.

Then, with a soft sigh, the dream dissolves into waking. You wake with the lingering sense that the speech was never meant for an audience—but for you.
