...hesitate, right before speaking. There's a strange, cotton-mouthed feeling clinging to the corner of my mind - like I *know* I shouldn't take this. But my voice obediently spills, "Okay. Right, yes. Ready to begin."

My fingers twitch, nervously fidgeting with the lanyard around my neck as my boss smiles expectantly. Their smile isn’t unpleasant – more a forced attempt at encouragement. It doesn't reach their eyes. They outline the project – redesigning the company’s entire data structure, incorporating a revolutionary new AI integration, and compiling a full financial projections report… all within thirty-six hours.

A tiny, almost translucent green hummingbird zips in front of my eyes during their description of requirements. It blinks slowly, and the numbers in my head start swirling like falling leaves in a gale. 

Suddenly, the "workplace" isn't quite right. The walls are shifting, made of flickering screens displaying lines of code I don't recognize. My desk is overgrown with ferns and mushrooms. Other colleagues I recognized from earlier are now... distorted. Mr. Henderson from Finance has a pineapple for a head. 

And *they's* all nodding. Expectantly. As if this chaotic environment is absolutely normal. 

A clock ticking above the doorway - the numerals made of buzzing bees - leaps ahead. Three hours already gone, and the buzzing intensity is growing. The hummingbird returns, hovering over the project brief, transforming from a tiny bird to a vast, shimmering projection of fractal algorithms. 

Panic tightens in my chest. I try to speak, to push back, to ask for adjustments. Nothing. My mouth works, soundless. Frustrating clicks and pops are all that escape. The world is rapidly deforming. Colors become supersaturated, textures ripple and twist, and everyone is staring - those pineapple-headed colleagues, that unwavering boss, even tiny, judgmental gophers wearing tiny business suits. 

Driven by an instinct I cannot ignore, I reach out – toward the hummingbird projection of algorithms - and *grab* a spinning pixel. 

It doesn't hurt. It *resonates*. 

And everything shatters.

Except for me. 

Now I am standing on a vast plain of polished amethyst. The sky glows a gentle, ever-shifting indigo. I can still dimly sense the pressure of the project, the expectation… but it is muffled, remote, like a persistent low hum in the distance. 

A single dandelion grows directly in front of me. From where it springs is emerging.... *a rabbit*. A very nonchalant rabbit munching clover, ignoring my presence. 

But its collar tag reads simply: “Deadline Adjuster.”

He looks up and yawns, “You weren’t listening to your gut instincts then, were you? Happens. You’re lucky I showed up. Let's reset.” Before he can finish speaking, the amethyst plain bursts into flowers...



Then the jarring sensation of hitting the ceiling of my own bed pulls me awake.
