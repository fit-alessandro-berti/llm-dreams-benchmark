**The Dream Continues...**

You tighten your grip on the ship’s helm, your knuckles white as the horizon tilts violently. The air reeks of salt and fear, but your voice booms over the roar of the tempest: **“Reef the sails! Man the bilge pumps—*now*!”** The crew scrambles, their faces etched with terror, but your steadiness anchors them. Lightning splits the sky, illuminating the monstrous wave looming astern. 

A young sailor shouts, **“We’ll never outrun it, Captain!”** For a heartbeat, doubt claws at your chest—*What if we founder? What if I fail them?*—but then you remember your father’s words, whispered years ago in another storm: **“The sea doesn’t respect strength. It respects resolve.”** 

**“Hard to port!”** you bark. The ship groans as you steer its battered hull *into* the wave, defying instinct. The crew locks arms, bracing as the wall of water crashes over the deck. The world dissolves into chaos—splintering wood, screaming wind, the taste of brine—but the ship holds. 

When the wave passes, the storm breaks. Dawn bleeds gold through thinning clouds, and the sea sighs into uneasy calm. The crew stares at you, soaked and shaking but alive. You nod, voice soft but firm: **“We sail on.”** 

As the dream fades, you feel the weight of the helm in your hands—not as a burden, but a covenant. Leadership, you realize, isn’t about calm seas. It’s about finding north stars in the dark. 

The storm, the crew, the choice… they dissolve. But the resolve remains.
