# Dream Continuation

You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and **the trees begin to bend in ways trees shouldn't bend—sideways, then spiraling like corkscrews. The sky darkens to a deep purple, but instead of rain, luminescent leaves start falling upward, defying gravity.**

**You notice your hands are translucent now, and you can see the forest path through them like looking through colored glass. A deer approaches, but it has too many legs—or perhaps the right number, you can't quite count them as they shift and multiply when you try to focus.**

**The storm speaks to you, not in words but in feelings that taste like copper and childhood memories. You realize you need to reach the center of the forest, though you've always been there, standing beneath a tree that grows both up and down simultaneously, its roots reaching into the clouds.**

**The wind carries whispers of people you haven't met yet, telling you secrets about yesterday. You're not afraid—the storm is somehow yours, or you are somehow its. Lightning cracks horizontally through the trees, leaving trails of frozen light you can touch like solid ribbons.**

**Then you remember: you have somewhere important to be, though you can't recall where or why...**
