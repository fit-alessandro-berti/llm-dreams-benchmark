...and you feel a wave of relief so profound it almost makes your knees buckle. You nod, unable to speak, and take the hand of the person closest to you. Their hand is warm, and surprisingly, it feels like they are made of softly packed earth and moss.

They don't ask where you're going; it seems they already know. They simply begin to walk, and you are swept along in their gentle current. As you move, the city begins to change. The cacophony of sirens and horns softens, blending into a gentle, rhythmic hum, like a city-sized cat purring. The cold glass and steel of the skyscrapers begin to shimmer, their sharp edges blurring. They stretch and sway, not like buildings in an earthquake, but like ancient trees in a slow breeze, their lights twinkling like captured stars.

The pavement beneath your feet is no longer hard and unforgiving. It becomes soft and springy, like a path in a deep forest. Streetlights drip honey-colored light that pools on the ground and doesn't burn.

The strangers don't speak with words, but you understand them perfectly. Their thoughts feel like warm breezes and familiar melodies in your mind. One of them offers you a small, smooth stone, and when you take it, it thrums with a faint, happy pulse. Another hums a tune that sounds like forgotten lullabies.

They lead you not to a street or a subway station, but to a small, unassuming wooden door set into the side of a shimmering glass wall. It looks completely out of place, yet utterly right.

The one holding your hand gives your fingers a final, reassuring squeeze and points toward the door. "You're not lost anymore," they say, and their voice is the sound of turning pages in a beloved book. "You were just on your way here."

You turn the cool, brass knob. The door swings open not onto a room, but onto a feeling—the specific, unmistakable comfort of being home. A soft, golden light spills out, smelling of rain on dry earth and clean laundry.

You step across the threshold, and the feeling of being found is so complete, so absolute, that you begin to wake up.
