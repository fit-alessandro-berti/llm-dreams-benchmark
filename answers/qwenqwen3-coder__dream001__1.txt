...start to panic as you notice your phone is dead and you can't even remember the address. The city seems to shift around you - street signs are in a language you don't recognize, and the buildings keep changing their shapes when you're not looking directly at them.

You begin to run through the winding streets, your footsteps echoing strangely, as if the city is trying to swallow the sound. People pass by, but when you try to ask for directions, they speak in whispers that turn into wind chimes, or their faces blur before you can read their expressions.

The sky above pulses between twilight and dawn, and you notice that your shadow is pointing in a different direction than where you're walking. Following your shadow instead, you discover it leads you to a towering clock face embedded in a wall - but the hands are spinning wildly, sometimes moving backward.

As you watch, mesmerized and confused, the clock face begins to crack, and through the cracks, you can see glimpses of familiar places - your childhood home, your workplace, your friend's apartment - all layered on top of each other like transparent film...

What happens next in your dream?
