panic for a moment, your heart racing as you look around at the towering buildings and bustling streets. The air smells faintly of rain, and the sound of distant thunder rumbles in the background. You clutch the small piece of paper with the address scribbled on it, but the handwriting is smudged and barely legible.

Desperate for help, you approach a street vendor selling umbrellas and ask if they know where the building might be. They shake their head apologetically but point toward a nearby subway station, suggesting that it could get you closer to the right area. As you descend into the dimly lit underground tunnel, the walls seem to close in around you, and the hum of the trains grows louder.

At the platform, something strange happens: instead of waiting for a train, you notice a peculiar door tucked between two advertisements. It’s slightly ajar, glowing faintly with an otherworldly light. Curiosity overtakes your anxiety, and you push the door open cautiously. On the other side, you find yourself standing in what appears to be a library—but not just any library. This one stretches infinitely in every direction, filled with shelves upon shelves of books that shimmer like starlight.

A figure approaches—a librarian dressed in flowing robes who seems both ancient and wise. "You're running out of time," they say calmly, their voice echoing softly. Before you can respond, they hand you a book bound in leather so dark it almost looks alive. When you open it, the pages are blank except for one sentence written in golden ink: *The meeting will take place wherever you believe it to be.*

Suddenly, everything shifts. The library dissolves, and you're back in the city, though now it feels smaller, more manageable. The address on the paper becomes crystal clear, and without hesitation, you begin walking. Each step feels lighter, as though the dream itself is guiding you. Eventually, you arrive at a modest office building, its entrance marked by a single golden plaque bearing your name.

Inside, you enter a room where people await—familiar faces from parts of your life you hadn’t thought about in years. There's no table, no agenda, just a sense of connection and understanding. One person speaks: "We've been waiting for you." And though you don’t fully understand why, you feel a deep sense of belonging, as if this was always meant to happen.

Then, just as suddenly, the scene fades, and you wake up, realizing the entire experience was a dream. But the feeling lingers—a quiet certainty that sometimes, even in dreams, we find exactly what we need.
