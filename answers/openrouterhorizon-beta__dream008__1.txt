…open your mouth to protest, but no sound comes out. The office lights flicker to a deep ocean blue, and the cubicles stretch into a horizon like a maze that keeps generating new turns. Your computer boots itself with a soft chime that sounds like your name being whispered. The project brief is a single sentence that keeps rearranging: “Finish everything before it starts.”

Your boss taps a watch that isn’t on their wrist. “We’re already late,” they say, smiling too widely, as if their teeth are copy-pasted.

You click the mouse, and the cursor turns into a hummingbird, flitting across the screen, pecking at icons that bloom into flowers and then into spreadsheets. The spreadsheet cells fill themselves: columns of weather, columns of memories, rows of passwords you’ve never made. The cells begin to overflow, numbers spilling out onto the desk like beads, pattering to the carpet and rolling under every chair. Everyone pretends not to notice.

The office printer begins to purr like a cat and disgorges pages that fall slowly, hovering in the air like jellyfish. Each page is stamped “DUE YESTERDAY,” but when you touch one, it becomes soft and warm, like bread out of the oven, and the ink smells like rain. You stack the pages in your arms, but they melt into a single smooth stone etched with a deadline: 8:08. You look at the clock. It only has the number 8 on it, in every position. The hands spin, then fold like origami cranes and fly away.

“Any questions?” your boss asks, except their voice comes from the ceiling vent. You try to nod, but your head feels like a helium balloon on a string, bobbing against the softly thunderous hum of fluorescent lights. The hum syncs with your heartbeat until the whole room breathes with you.

You stand. Your chair sighs with relief and floats up like a lifeguard chair, scanning the office with binoculars. You gather your courage like files and go to the whiteboard, which is now a window looking out onto a city made of graph paper. Streets are lined with sticky notes that flutter like leaves. The “impossible deadline” sits on the skyline as a sunset—close enough to touch, too far to reach. It pulses whenever you blink, getting closer each time your eyes open.

“Start where?” you ask, and the floor politely tilts, rolling you toward a door you’ve never noticed—a door shaped like a question mark. You push it open and step into a conference room that’s actually a train car. Everyone from your department is seated, faces calm and blank as envelopes. The train is moving without tracks, gliding over a carpet of quiet applause.

A conductor in a vest made of calendar pages clips your ticket, which is also your to-do list. With each clip, items vanish: Outline, Draft, Revise, Approve, Send. Relief brushes your shoulders like a wind. The conductor leans in. “We arrive precisely when you begin,” he whispers, and hands you a pen shaped like a compass.

You look down. The project is now a small plant in your palm, a tight green coil with a note attached: “Water with attention.” You ask for a glass and someone hands you a megaphone. You pour attention through it anyway. The plant uncurls, grows leaves made of emails you meant to send, blossoms into little desk lamps that wink on one by one, lighting a path along the train car’s aisle.

Your boss appears at the far end of the car, applauding soundlessly. You take a step, then another, and realize the aisle is actually a balance beam strung between Now and Now. You don’t fall. Your feet remember a certainty your head forgot. The hummingbird cursor lands on your shoulder, a warm tickle. “Begin here,” it whispers, tapping your collarbone. “Begin now. Begin again.”

You sit, the plant settling into the empty space on your lap, roots threading through your fingers like gentle threads tying you to the moment. You open the pen-compass. Instead of ink, a small river pours out onto the page, smooth and continuous. The page doesn’t get wet. It becomes a landscape, and your handwriting carves valleys. The train windows lift, revealing sky after sky, each labeled with a different hour that all read the same: Enough time.

You write the first line, and the deadline in the distance breaks apart into a flock of birds. They circle once, twice, then perch on the rafters and become ordinary shadows. Your boss’s smile softens into something human. “There it is,” they say, and their voice is back in their mouth. “You’ve started.”

You look down to find that the plant has grown into a small tree with a clock nested in its branches. It ticks steadily, kindly. Every tick is a step you’ve already taken. Every tock is a step that’s already waiting for you to meet it.

You exhale. The maze of cubicles shrinks back to a room. The hummingbird settles into your palm and becomes the cursor again, blinking patiently. The page welcomes the next sentence, and the next, as if they were always here, waiting behind the door shaped like a question. And when you glance up at the impossible deadline, it’s just a horizon—still far, still glowing, but no longer a wall. It’s a sunrise disguised as a finish line, and you are already walking toward it.
