…turn back to your desk, but it’s no longer your desk. Instead, it’s a narrow wooden table floating in the middle of a vast, still lake under a sky shimmering with strange pink clouds. A half-finished cup of coffee sits beside you, but instead of steam, faint birds made of light rise from it, fluttering away and disappearing into the air.

Your boss is still there, standing on the water as if it’s solid ground, tapping a clipboard impatiently. The “project” is now just a single sheet of paper with one cryptic sentence written in ink that keeps rearranging itself into different shapes and languages. You lean in to read it, but every time you get close, the letters drop down through the page like they’re falling into another world.

Around the lake’s edge, coworkers you’ve never met are quietly hammering on typewriters made of glass, and every key they press sends ripples across the water toward you. The ripples move through your body like a tingle — strangely calming — but you realize they’re making your fingers type by themselves. Words you don't understand are spilling onto your own sheet, and your boss nods solemnly, as though this is exactly what they wanted.

Somewhere far away, a clock begins ticking down. With each tick, the horizon draws closer.  

Do you want me to **finish the dream in a calming way, or in an unsettling way**?
