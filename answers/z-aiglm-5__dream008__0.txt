...feel your feet rooted to the carpet, unable to move. The fluorescent lights above seem to hum louder, a low drone that vibrates in your teeth.

Your boss is staring. Waiting. His face is patient, unreasonably patient, and that's somehow worse than anger. He holds out a manila folder, but when you reach for it, your hand passes through it like smoke.

"I need this by Tuesday," he says.

Tuesday. You know with sudden, dream-certainty that today is Monday. That the folder contains something impossible. A building to design. A code to write. A translation of a language that doesn't exist.

You look down at your desk. Your computer screen shows a document already open, the cursor blinking, and you realize you've been typing for hours without knowing it. The words on the screen aren't words. They're small, neat drawings of doors.

"We're all counting on you," your boss says, and now he's not alone. The whole office is behind him. Your coworkers. People you don't recognize. A dog, sitting patiently by the water cooler.

The fluorescent light flickers.

You try to speak, to explain about the time, about the impossibility of it all. But when you open your mouth, a single crisp apple falls out, rolls across the desk, and lands softly in your boss's waiting hand.

He takes a bite.

"Good," he says, nodding slowly. "This is a good start."
