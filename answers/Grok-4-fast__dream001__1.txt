You start to wander the labyrinthine streets, where skyscrapers twist like vines toward a sky that's equal parts twilight and aurora, pulsing with colors that shouldn't exist. Your phone—wait, do you even have one?—buzzes faintly in your pocket, but when you pull it out, the screen shows a map that's alive, rivers of ink flowing backward, labeling buildings with names like "The Clockwork Regret" and "Whispers' End." Panic bubbles up, sweet and fizzy like champagne gone wrong, but then a street vendor materializes from the steam of a glowing cart, hawking "Directions to Anywhere, One Wish Extra."

You hand over a coin you didn't know you had—it's warm, etched with your childhood home's address—and he points to a alleyway that wasn't there a second ago. "Follow the shadows that sing," he says, his eyes like shattered mirrors. You plunge in, and the walls breathe, murmuring half-forgotten secrets: the plot twist from that book you never finished, the lyrics to a song from a dream within this dream. The alley spits you out onto a rooftop plaza where clocks melt into puddles and reform as birds, all ticking in reverse.

There, across a table set with teacups full of stars, sits the person you're meant to meet—not a boss or colleague, but a version of yourself from ten years ago, grinning like they know the punchline. "You're late," they say, but their voice is yours, echoing with laughter. The meeting? It's about rewriting the rules of gravity, or maybe just ordering pizza that delivers from the future. You sit, the city unfurling below like a map you finally understand, and as the aurora sky cracks open to reveal an ocean of fireflies, you realize: in dreams, the only deadline is waking up. But for now, the conversation flows eternal, and the hour stretches into forever.
