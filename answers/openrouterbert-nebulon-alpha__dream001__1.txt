**The Dream Unfolds—**

You’re standing at the edge of a towering, labyrinthine city—its streets twist like veins, pulsing with neon and shadow. The air hums with a low, electric thrum, as if the buildings themselves are alive, breathing. You check your pockets: no phone, no map, just a crumpled business card with a single word scrawled in ink that smudges when you touch it—*"Echelon."*

A clock tower looms in the distance, its face cracked, the hands spinning wildly. *Fifty-eight minutes left.*

You start walking, but the sidewalks shift beneath your feet. A street that was empty a second ago now teems with faceless figures in long coats, their whispers rising like static. One turns toward you—its mouth is a smooth, featureless void—and says, *"You’re late, but not in the way you think."*

A flicker of movement: a child in a red hoodie darts past, holding a lantern that casts no light. She tosses you a key. *"For the door that isn’t there yet,"* she giggles, before vanishing into an alley that wasn’t there a moment ago.

The key burns in your palm. You turn it over—engraved on the bow is a symbol: a spiral with an eye at its center.

A voice crackles from a rusted intercom on a nearby wall: *"Proceed to the intersection of Never and Always. The meeting is in the space between."*

You look up. The street signs above you read:
**NEVER ST.**
**ALWAYS AVE.**

But the intersection doesn’t exist. The two streets run parallel, stretching into infinity, never touching.

Then—*a door.* A plain, wooden door, standing alone in the middle of the sidewalk. The key fits. You turn it.

The door swings open not into a room, but into *another city*—this one made of glass, where the sky is a mirror reflecting a version of you that’s already sitting at a long table, sipping coffee. The *other* you looks up, smiles, and says:

*"Took you long enough. The meeting started the moment you realized you were dreaming."*

Behind them, the table stretches endlessly, filled with versions of you from every possible timeline—some in suits, some in pajamas, one in a diving helmet, another with no face at all. At the head of the table sits a figure wrapped in shadows, their voice like wind through a tunnel:

*"We’ve been waiting. The question isn’t where the meeting is. It’s *when* you’ll finally show up."*

The clock tower chimes. The hands stop.

**You wake up—**

—gasping, your sheets tangled, the taste of ozone in your mouth. Your phone buzzes. A calendar alert:

**"Meeting with [REDACTED] – 9:00 AM – Location: TBD."**

And on your nightstand, half-buried under a stack of unpaid bills, is a single key.

You don’t remember putting it there.
