…you feel a storm approaching and the air goes strangely still, as if the forest is holding its breath.

The leaves stop rustling. Even the insects go quiet. A thin, metallic scent—rain on stone—slides into your lungs. You look up through the canopy and the sky has turned the color of bruised water, heavy and unreal, like someone painted it too dark on purpose. Far off, thunder doesn’t boom so much as *purr*, low and patient.

The first drop hits your forehead—cold enough to sting. Then another. Then a sudden handful, like the clouds have tipped a bucket. The path you were on begins to shine, each pebble reflecting a dim, shifting light.

You start walking faster, not exactly running, because your legs feel as if the ground is gently moving under you, as if the forest floor is a slow conveyor belt. The trees seem closer than they were a moment ago. Their trunks stretch upward in elegant, impossible angles, and every time lightning flashes, the bark looks briefly like veins under skin.

A gust of wind comes through, sharp and purposeful. It doesn’t just push rain—it pushes *sound*. You hear something inside it: a word you can’t quite understand, spoken in a voice that feels familiar in the way your own name feels familiar. The wind says it again, and you realize it’s not a word, it’s a direction.

You follow it.

Branches knit together overhead, making a tunnel. The rain thickens, but it doesn’t soak you. It hangs in the air in bright beads, suspended for a heartbeat too long, and you pass through them like a curtain of cold pearls. Your hair rises as if charged with static, and the hairs on your arms lift in anticipation.

Lightning cracks—white, close—and for an instant everything is daylight. In that flash you see it: a small door set into the base of an oak, no bigger than a book cover, with a brass handle polished by invisible hands. There’s no reason for it to be there, which is exactly how you know it belongs.

Behind you, thunder finally speaks loud enough to feel. It rolls through your ribs like a warning. The wind urges you forward again, gentle now, almost pleading.

You kneel. The door is warm beneath your fingertips, warm like sunlit wood even in the storm’s shadow. You hesitate just long enough for another flash of lightning to reveal a faint carving above the handle: a spiral, a closed eye, a river that turns back into itself.

You open the door.

Instead of darkness, there is a narrow staircase descending into a glow the color of early morning. You step inside, and the storm’s roar cuts off as if someone has shut a window.

Your feet meet dry stone. The air smells of moss and paper and something sweet—like apples sliced thin. As you go down, you begin to hear a different kind of rain: not falling, but *tapping*, as if droplets are writing on glass.

The staircase ends in a room that shouldn’t fit inside any tree. It’s wide as a small library, ceiling lost in mist, shelves curving around the walls in a spiral. Books lie open on tables. Some pages are blank, waiting. Others are filled with handwriting you recognize as yours, though you don’t remember writing a single word.

At the center of the room sits a shallow pool, perfectly still. No ripples. No reflection of the ceiling. Only a reflection of the forest above—storming, shaking, alive.

A figure stands on the far side of the pool, half-hidden by the dimness. Their outline shifts like a shadow deciding what it wants to be. When they speak, their voice is quiet, but it lands inside you with the weight of certainty.

“You brought the storm with you,” they say, not accusing, just stating a fact.

You try to answer, but your mouth feels full of rainwater. You swallow and manage, “I didn’t mean to.”

They nod, as if that’s what everyone says at first.

They gesture to the pool. The surface remains glassy, but the image within changes: you see yourself on the forest path from above, small under towering trees. Lightning strikes again in that scene, and instead of burning, it blossoms into white flowers that open and close in time with the thunder.

“The forest doesn’t mind storms,” the figure says. “Storms are how it remembers.”

You lean closer to the pool, and the air above it cools your face. In the reflection, you see the tiny door you just came through. In the reflection, it is already closed. In the reflection, there is no handle.

A soft panic rises, then fades, replaced by a strange calm—as if the dream has decided you no longer need to be afraid.

On a nearby table lies a book with a cover the color of wet earth. It isn’t titled, but you know it’s yours. The pages flutter on their own, turning to a place marked by a pressed leaf. When the book stops, you see a sentence written in fresh ink, still glossy:

*To leave the storm, you must name what it wants.*

The figure watches you carefully, like a teacher waiting for you to solve a problem you’ve been solving your whole life without knowing it.

You think of the wind’s not-word. You think of the hush before the first raindrop. You think of how the forest felt like it was listening to you.

And then, without planning to, you speak aloud—not to the figure, not to the room, but to whatever is moving behind the weather.

“I want to be forgiven,” you say.

The pool shivers.

The storm in the reflection falters, as if surprised by your honesty. Thunder softens into distance. The lightning becomes slow, gentle, as though it’s no longer trying to warn you, only to show you the way.

The figure exhales, and for the first time you can see their face clearly—only to realize it keeps trying to become a different face: yours as a child, yours as you are now, yours with tired eyes and a steadier mouth. It settles for something close to you, but not quite.

“That’s one name,” they say. “But storms are greedy. Listen again.”

You close your eyes. The room fills with that tapping sound—rain writing on glass—and you understand, in the way dreams make you understand, that it isn’t rain at all.

It’s countless small decisions you didn’t make. It’s words you swallowed. It’s apologies that never found their way out of you. It’s the quiet pressure of being almost-brave, almost-honest, almost-ready.

You open your eyes and look at the book. The ink is drying.

“I want to stop running,” you whisper.

This time the pool doesn’t just shiver—it releases a ripple that travels outward and touches the stone edges like a bell being struck. The shelves tremble. A few books sigh open as if relieved.

Above, in the reflection, the storm breaks. The clouds part, not into blue sky, but into a soft, luminous gray like the world right after rain. Sunlight falls through the canopy in slow beams. Every leaf glows.

The figure steps back and points, not to the stairs, but to another door you hadn’t noticed—taller, made of woven branches and pale bark. It stands where there was only wall before. Its handle is a simple loop of vine.

“Go,” the figure says. “Not back the way you came. Forward the way you meant to.”

You hesitate, glancing at your book, at the pool, at the stillness that feels earned.

“What happens if I forget?” you ask.

The figure smiles, small and sad and kind at once. “You will. That’s why the forest keeps doors.”

You walk to the new door. When you touch it, it opens into brightness—not blinding, but warm. You step through.

You are back in the forest, but everything has been washed clean. The air is sweet and cool. Raindrops cling to spiderwebs like necklaces. Somewhere a bird tests its voice, one note at a time.

The path ahead is different. The trees are the same, yet spaced in a way that makes room for you. And as you begin walking, you realize you are leaving footprints that fill with tiny clear water, each one reflecting sky.

Behind you, far away, thunder murmurs once—content, like an animal turning over to sleep.

You walk on, and the light between the leaves starts to look less like sunlight and more like the pale glow of morning through closed eyelids.

Just before you wake, you hear the forest breathe out. In that breath is the not-word again, finally understandable, spoken in your own voice:

“Begin.”
