speak, but the words feel stuck in your throat. A wave of nervousness washes over you, and instead of your rehearsed opening line, a birdlike chirp escapes your mouth. The audience exchanges confused glances, and you clear your throat, determined to regain control. 

Suddenly, the microphone in your hand transforms into a blooming flower, its petals glimmering with colors you’ve never seen before. The stage beneath your feet begins to ripple like water, and the crowd blurs into a kaleidoscope of shifting shapes and hues. You feel a strange sense of calm as the room dissolves, and you find yourself floating in a serene, starlit sky.

The stars sparkle brighter, and you realize they are forming words, spelling out the exact speech you were meant to give. You instinctively "read" it from the constellations, your voice now carrying a melodic tone that resonates perfectly in this dreamlike space. The audience, though no longer visible, seems to cheer and clap from somewhere far away, their ovation echoing through the cosmos.

Just as you feel a surge of triumph, a shooting star zips toward you, growing larger and brighter until it envelops you in light. When it fades, you find yourself back on the stage, the audience on their feet, applauding wildly. But you’re left wondering—did you actually deliver the speech, or were they simply clapping for the unspoken magic of the moment?

You turn back to the microphone, now just an ordinary object again, and take a breath to speak—for real this time—but suddenly you wake up.
