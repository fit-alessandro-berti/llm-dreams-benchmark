The landscape is rural, with rolling hills and a nearby forest. People are dressed in simple, rustic clothing, indicating a pre-industrial era.

As you walk towards the village center, you notice a blacksmith hammering away at his forge, children playing with wooden toys, and women carrying baskets filled with goods. You decide to approach a friendly-looking elderly woman sitting in front of a thatched-roof cottage, weaving a basket.

With a sense of purpose, you decide to clear the area and study the carvings more closely. Perhaps this structure holds the key to both understanding this era and returning to your own. The dream continues as you work to unravel the mysteries of this ancient stone structure, hoping it will lead you back home...
