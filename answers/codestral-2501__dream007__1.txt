It seems like we're in the middle of a heated argument, and the tension is palpable. Your friend is standing across from you, their eyes narrowed in concentration, and their hands clenched at their sides. The room is quiet, except for the occasional rustle of papers or the soft hum of the air conditioning.

You take a deep breath, trying to calm your racing heart. "I just don't understand why you can't see it," you say, your voice steady despite the turmoil inside you. "This is what's best for us, for our future. We need to make this change."

Your friend leans in, their expression serious. "And what about my needs, my dreams?" they counter, their voice just as firm. "We can't just ignore them. We need to find a way to make this work for both of us."

The room is silent, the only sound the ticking of the clock on the wall. You feel a pang of guilt, knowing that you've been so focused on your own goals that you've overlooked your friend's. But you also know that you can't keep living like this, that you need to make a change.

You look at your friend, seeing the determination in their eyes. You know that this is going to be a long conversation, but you're ready to listen, to understand, and to find a way forward together.

What do you do next?
