...you gratefully accept. They don't speak my language, not with words anyway, but their smiles are universally understood. One, a woman with eyes the color of warm honey, takes my hand, her touch surprisingly firm and reassuring. Another, a young man with a mischievous glint in his eyes, points down a cobbled street, miming the act of walking with exaggerated steps, a wide grin splitting his face.

The city, which moments ago felt like a suffocating maze of noise and anonymous faces, starts to soften. The strangers guide me through winding alleyways that smell of exotic spices and blooming jasmine, past vibrant market stalls overflowing with fruits I’ve never seen before. They laugh at my astonished expressions, their laughter like wind chimes in the gentle breeze.

And then, a deeper understanding dawns: *this* feeling, this connection, is what I was searching for all along. It wasn't a place I needed to find, but a feeling. And in this dream, in this hidden garden, with these kind, silent strangers, I have found it.

The ruby-red liquid is poured into a small, intricately carved cup. I lift it to my lips, and as the sweet, slightly tart liquid touches my tongue…I begin to float, gently, upwards, the courtyard shrinking below, the city lights twinkling like fallen stars… and then… I…
