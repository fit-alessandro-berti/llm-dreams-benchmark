...step back from the words for a moment.

Something strange happens. The room begins to breathe.

The walls — your friend's living room, you think, though the furniture keeps shifting slightly — start to slowly expand and contract, like the walls are lungs. The argument is still happening. You can feel it in your chest, that tight, compressed feeling of wanting to be *right* so badly it almost hurts.

But now you notice your friend's face is doing something extraordinary.

It's cycling. Very slowly. Through every expression you've ever seen them wear. Age seven, laughing so hard they fell off a bicycle. Age sixteen, crying in the back of someone's car. Last year, when something good happened and they called you first.

You realize you've forgotten what you're arguing about.

Not in the frustrating way — in the *dissolving* way.

You try to reconstruct the argument and find only the shape of it. Something about loyalty. Something about a choice one of you made. The content keeps slipping through your fingers like warm sand.

Your friend is still speaking. Their voice has become something like music — you can hear the *feeling* of it clearly, even as the words blur.

What you hear is: *I needed you to understand.*

What you hear underneath that is: *I was afraid.*

You open your mouth and what comes out isn't your argument anymore.

It's just their name.

And the walls stop breathing.

And the room holds very, very still.
