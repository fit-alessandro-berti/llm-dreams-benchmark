…and I almost don’t believe it at first. The city is too loud—the sirens, the flicker of neon, the river of faceless people pushing past. But then one of them rests a gentle hand on my shoulder like she’s steadying a spinning compass.  
   
“Which way are you trying to go?” she asks, and her voice is softer than the subway brakes, softer than doubt.  
   
I try to answer, but all I have is the shape of a name on my tongue; it slips away like steam. Another stranger—an older man in a paint-splattered coat—unfolds a paper map no one uses anymore. The creases are cracked white, like lightning across boroughs.  
   
“We’ll triangulate,” he jokes, and somehow that word feels like a promise.  
   
They form an effortless constellation around me: the map-man, the woman with the steadying hand, a cyclist still clipped into toe cages, a kid balancing a cello case, a drag queen who flashes me stage-light confidence. A taxi idles; the driver rolls down the window and waves us in even though we’re six people without the right change.  
   
When I hesitate, the cyclist shrugs. “Cities grow new arteries at night. We just ride the pulse.”  
   
So we ride. Manhattan recedes into a glaze of reds and blues, Queens lifts like a paper cut-out, and the kid with the cello names bridges like poems: Throgs Neck, Triborough, Verrazzano. Each name loosens the knot in my chest.  
   
We cross water because sometimes being lost is just a matter of choosing the right river. Somewhere over the Harlem, the drag queen fixes a smear of eyeliner I hadn’t noticed—her thumb warm, precise—and tells me, “Every compass breaks until someone takes the time to spin it true.”  
   
Next stop: Brooklyn, where the night market leaks cinnamon steam and the air smells like trust. The strangers trade glances; decisions ripple among them without words. The map is abandoned; instead, they begin handing me pieces of themselves—a subway token, the spare key taped under the cyclist’s seat, a paper crane folded from the map after the man tears it in half with theatrical flair.  
   
“Assembling a new map,” he explains. “You’ll only need the edges that matter.”  
   
We follow small things now: a green neon pharmacy cross reflected in a puddle, the distant tinny echo of a reggaetón melody playing two streets over, the smell of onions from a 24-hour bodega. With every cue, a corner of the city lights up.  
   
And then, impossibly, I see it: a stoop with a chipped sky-blue railing—my grandmother’s old house transplanted onto this Brooklyn block like some impossible vine had dragged it across boroughs while I blinked. The flag with the cherry stains is still tied to the rail. I haven’t seen that house since childhood, since the last time I knew exactly where I belonged.  
   
I turn to thank them, but they’re already dissolving back into ordinary urban noise, urban kindness: the cyclist clipping into traffic, the cello kid hefting his instrument toward the F train, the drag queen giving a twirl that sends a shimmer of sequins floating like startled pigeons. The map-man folds the fragments into my pocket. His grin is the final coordinate.  
   
“Remember,” he says before he’s gone, “getting found is just another word for letting the city love you back.”  
   
I climb the stoop. Below the city keeps breathing—loud, enormous, mine.
