**You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you—**

—stand at the helm, gripping the wheel with white-knuckled determination. The wind howls like a vengeful spirit, and the waves rise like mountains, their crests slamming onto the deck with a force that shakes the very bones of the ship. The crew scrambles to secure ropes, batten hatches, and brace themselves against the chaos.

You raise your voice above the storm, not in panic, but in command. "Batten down the hatches! Hold fast! We ride this out together!"

The first mate nods, his face streaked with rain and salt, but his eyes steady. The crew moves in unison—some to the rigging, others to the pumps, all trusting in your leadership. The ship groans as another wave crashes over the bow, but you hold firm.

Then, through the howling wind, you hear something else—something not of the storm. A distant, eerie singing. It weaves through the chaos, hypnotic and unnatural. The crew exchanges uneasy glances. One young sailor, his face pale, points starboard.

"There—!"

A shape emerges from the mist. Not another ship, but something older, something that doesn’t belong in the waking world. A ghostly vessel, its sails tattered, its deck crowded with figures who are not entirely human. Their hollow eyes lock onto yours, and the singing grows louder.

The first mate grips his pistol. "Captain?"

You exhale, steeling yourself. The storm rages, the dead draw near, and the choice is yours alone: fight, flee, or choose a third path—one whispered in the language of dreams.

What do you do?
