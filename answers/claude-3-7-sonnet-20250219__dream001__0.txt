You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panic, but take a deep breath and decide to explore methodically. The architecture around you is a strange blend of Art Deco and something almost organic—buildings with flowing curves that shouldn't be possible with concrete and steel.

As you walk, you notice that your shadow doesn't quite match your movements. When you turn to look at it directly, it behaves normally, but in your peripheral vision, it seems to move with a slight delay.

A street vendor selling glowing blue fruits calls out to you. "Lost?" she asks with a knowing smile. Her eyes shift color as she speaks, from amber to violet. "Everyone is, their first time here. The city remembers you, even if you don't remember it."

She hands you a fruit without asking for payment. "Eat this. It helps with the remembering."

The fruit tastes like childhood memories and déjà vu. As you swallow the last bite, street signs that were previously in an indecipherable script suddenly make perfect sense. You now know exactly where your meeting is—in the Spiral Tower at the city's center.

But as you approach the tower, you realize that everyone entering is wearing elaborate masks. You don't have one, and the stern doorkeeper is turning away the unmasked. From an alleyway, you hear a whisper: "Need a face for the occasion?"

A figure draped in shadows holds out a mirror. In its reflection, you see yourself wearing a beautiful mask made of clockwork and moonlight. When you touch your face, you feel nothing there, but somehow you know that others will see the mask.

You enter the tower, riding an elevator that moves in impossible directions—not just up and down, but somehow sideways and through time. When the doors open, you're exactly on time for your meeting.

And that's when you realize who you're meeting: yourself, but from tomorrow, ready to pass on crucial information that only you would understand...
