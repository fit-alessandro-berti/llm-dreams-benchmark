feel a wave of panic wash over you. The office around you begins to warp and distort, the walls bending inward as if they’re closing in. Your desk is suddenly piled high with papers, each one stamped with urgent red ink that seems to pulse like a heartbeat. Your computer screen flickers, displaying an endless stream of emails, each one more demanding than the last.

You try to speak, to tell your boss that the deadline is impossible, but your voice comes out as a faint whisper, barely audible over the growing hum of the office. Your boss, now towering over you, doesn’t seem to hear. Their face stretches into an unnatural grin, and they say, “You’ll figure it out. You always do,” in a voice that echoes unnaturally, reverberating inside your skull.

Suddenly, the floor beneath you begins to crumble, and you’re falling through layers of the building, each floor a different scene from your past—old classrooms, childhood bedrooms, forgotten arguments with friends. You land with a thud in a vast, empty warehouse, the project papers still clutched in your hands. The deadline looms like a storm cloud above you, crackling with lightning that spells out “DUE NOW” in jagged letters.

But then, a figure approaches from the shadows. It’s someone you haven’t seen in years—maybe an old mentor or a childhood friend. They smile calmly and say, “It’s not as hard as it looks. Break it down.” They hand you a pair of scissors, and as you cut the massive stack of papers into smaller, manageable pieces, the storm cloud begins to dissipate. The warehouse transforms into a serene meadow, the papers turning into wildflowers that sway gently in the breeze.

You feel a sense of relief, but just as you’re about to thank the figure, they vanish. The meadow starts to blur, and you hear a faint beeping sound growing louder. It’s your alarm clock. You wake up, heart still racing, wondering if there’s a project you’ve forgotten about, but relieved to find it was all just a dream.
