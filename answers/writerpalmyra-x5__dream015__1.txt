...start a library.

Not a grand one—just a cracked plastic tarp stretched between two rusted I-beams, fluttering like a tired flag. Beneath it: books. Water-stained, spine-broken, some missing pages. A child’s primer on botany. A dog-eared novel about love on Mars. A cookbook with recipes for banquets no one will ever eat. I collect them wherever I can—half-buried in dust, clutched in hollowed-out hands, traded for a day’s worth of filtered water.

People think I’m crazy. “What good is a story when you’re starving?” they ask. But I’ve seen a man weep after reading three pages of poetry. I’ve watched a girl learn to spell her name by candlelight, then write it in the dirt like a spell to bring back the world.

So I keep walking. Collecting. Teaching. Believing that as long as someone remembers how to imagine something better, we’re not truly lost.

Do you think that’s foolish? Or have you, too, been saving something small you believe the world might need again?
