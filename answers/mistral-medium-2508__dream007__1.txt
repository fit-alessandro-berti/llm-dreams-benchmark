walk away—not in anger, but with a heavy, aching silence. The air between you feels thick, like the moment before a storm breaks. You step outside into a city street that isn’t quite familiar, though it hums with the echoes of places you’ve been before. The buildings stretch upward, their windows glowing with warm, golden light, but the sidewalks are empty, as if the world has paused just for you.

You turn a corner and find yourself in a narrow alleyway lined with doors—dozens of them, each slightly different in color and texture. One is weathered oak with a brass knocker shaped like a lion’s head; another is painted a faded blue, peeling at the edges. A third is sleek and modern, its surface reflecting your own tired face back at you. A whisper—your friend’s voice, but softer, sadder—floats from somewhere unseen: *"You always leave when it matters."*

Your hand hovers over the blue door. You know, somehow, that opening it won’t lead you back to the argument, but somewhere else entirely. Maybe to a memory: the two of you laughing under a bridge during a summer rain, or the time they showed up at 3 AM with your favorite book after your heart was broken. Or maybe it’s a future—a version of you both who figured out how to hold space for disagreement without letting it swallow the love.

But before you can choose, the alleyway shifts. The doors multiply, then dissolve into mist. You’re standing on the edge of a vast, glassy lake under a sky streaked with auroras—greens and purples rippling like silk. Your friend is there, too, on the opposite shore. They’re not yelling anymore. They’re just… waiting.

The water isn’t cold when you step in. It carries you effortlessly, as if the lake itself is deciding whether to pull you under or deliver you safely. Halfway across, you realize you’re not swimming—you’re walking on the surface, the ripples holding you up. Your friend starts toward you, doing the same. When you meet in the middle, neither of you speaks at first. Then they say, *"I don’t want to lose you over this."*

And you understand, suddenly, that the argument wasn’t about the thing at all. It was about the fear of being unseen, of mattering less than the idea of being right. You reach out, and your hands meet between you—not to pull, not to push, but to *anchor*.

The auroras above you swirl into a single, brilliant pulse of light. When it fades, you’re back in the room where the argument started, but the air is lighter now. Your friend is looking at you with the same exhaustion, the same hope. They sigh and say, *"So… pizza and bad movies?"*

You laugh, and the dream unravels like a held breath, leaving you with the quiet certainty that some things are bigger than being right.
