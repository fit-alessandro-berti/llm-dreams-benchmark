You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and—  

—a brush floats toward you, its bristles shimmering with liquid starlight. The moment your fingers close around its warm, humming handle, the canvas inhales. Not a sound, but a *pull*, like the world holding its breath.  

You dip the brush into the air—and the air *gives*. Thick, swirling paint wells from nothingness: cobalt blue mixed with the scent of rain, molten gold humming a low C-sharp, violet streaked with the echo of a forgotten lullaby.  

You touch brush to canvas.  

The instant the first stroke lands, the landscape *shatters*. Not into pieces, but into *possibilities*. The trees behind you sprout clock faces that drip honeyed light. The sky folds itself into origami birds that sing in reverse. Your footprints bloom into phosphorescent mushrooms that whisper your childhood secrets to the wind.  

But the canvas… the canvas drinks your colors and *answers*. Where you paint a river, a real current surges beneath your feet, carrying petals that dissolve into fireflies. Where you sketch a door, the air cracks open—a hallway stretches infinitely, lined with mirrors showing versions of you wearing crowns of thorns, halos of smoke, wings woven from static.  

You realize: this isn’t *your* dream anymore.  
The canvas is dreaming *through you*.  

And it’s hungry for more.  

*(Do you paint your deepest fear? Your truest desire? Or do you drop the brush and run—knowing the canvas will follow, unraveling reality with every step?)*
