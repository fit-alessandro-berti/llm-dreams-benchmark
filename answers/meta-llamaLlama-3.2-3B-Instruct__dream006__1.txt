...read from a paper in my hand, but to my surprise, it's not the speech I had planned out hours ago. The words on the page are jumbled and nonsensical, with sentences that don't make sense and words that are spelled incorrectly. I try to squint at the paper to decipher the meaning, but it's too late. The crowd's attention is already on me, and I can feel their expectant energy.

As I stand there, frozen in uncertainty, the words on the page begin to change. They start to rearrange themselves, forming a coherent sentence that reads: "The clouds are whispering secrets to the trees." The words on the page shift and rearrrange, revealing a new sentence: "The trees are listening to the whispers, and they are speaking in a language that only the flowers can understand."

I look out at the crowd, hoping someone will catch on to the surreal words, but they seem just as perplexed as I am. Some of them glance around, wondering if the stage manager is coming to rescue me, while others seem entranced by the unfolding words on the page.

With a sense of growing unease, I begin to improvise. I start speaking in a voice that's both confident and uncertain, weaving together fragments of poetry, scientific facts, and nonsense phrases that seem to be coming from nowhere. The words spill out of me like a river, and I lose myself in the flow of language.

As I speak, the words on the page continue to shift and change, revealing new secrets and mysteries. The crowd begins to sway, mesmerized by the words and the emotions that I'm pouring out onto the stage. I lose track of time, lost in the dreamlike state of the performance.

The speech becomes a dance of words, a primal expression of the language that lives within me. I become a conduit for the words, a vessel for the secrets that the paper is revealing. And as I speak, the crowd becomes a part of me, and I become a part of the words, merging into a single, fluid entity that transcends the stage and the audience.
