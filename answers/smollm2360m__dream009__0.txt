Dream (I): I woke up from a deep and blissful sleep feeling incredibly alive, my body rejuvenated by the tranquility. The first thing I notice is the vastness of space. I look at my surroundings with great wonder as if seeing them for the first time again. There it is – an ancient, yet mesmerizing city unlike anything I've ever seen before. My legs are covered in iridescent fabrics that light up when touched and glow with soft blue-green hues whenever you walk by. I also see a magnificent skylight above with breathtakingly vibrant colors. It seems like the sky itself might take on this beauty in me after all this time away from my normal world! The atmosphere is alive, every breath, every pulse of life it generates feels so real to me. Yet, no matter how hard I try, finding these moments and being around them makes everything feel a little... abstract for me, I suppose? It's as if I'm trying to hold onto memories of my past while realizing the vastness of where I can go now.
