take a step back from the intensity of the moment. You feel your heart racing, your voice rising, but something inside you clicks—there’s no need to push harder or dig deeper into the anger. Instead, you pause, breathe deeply, and look your friend in the eyes.

“Hey, I know this is important to both of us,” you say calmly, “but maybe we’re not going to see eye-to-eye right now. Let’s take a break, cool off, and come back to this later when we’re both clearer.”

Your friend hesitates for a moment, their expression softening as they realize the tension too. They nod slowly, understanding that this isn’t about winning or losing, but about preserving the relationship. Together, you agree to revisit the conversation another time, when emotions aren’t running so high.

As you walk away from the argument, you feel a strange sense of relief. The dream shifts, and instead of lingering on the conflict, you find yourself in a quiet park. The sun is setting, casting a warm glow over everything. You sit down on a bench, feeling lighter, more at peace. In the distance, you hear the faint sound of laughter—maybe it’s your friend, maybe it’s someone else. Either way, the air feels easier now, and you realize that sometimes, stepping away from an argument can be the best way to find clarity.

In the distance, a dog runs by, chasing after a ball, and you smile, knowing that not every problem needs to be solved in the heat of the moment.
