…take a walk to cool down. The night air is dense and humming, like a song you almost remember. Streetlights lift out of the pavement like flowers and tilt their faces toward you as you pass. Your friend’s footsteps echo ahead of you—too many footsteps for one person, then just one, then none at all.

You turn a corner and the argument follows, still speaking in your friend’s voice but now coming from the trees, from the curb, from the small orange cat waiting at the crosswalk. The cat blinks and says the exact sentence you’ve been avoiding: “You never listen unless you’re ready to leave.” You start to protest, but your throat opens and moths flutter out, each one carrying the word “but” on its wings.

You both end up at the park that used to be a parking lot, or maybe the parking lot that used to be a park. It’s hard to tell. Benches float a few inches off the ground, tethered to the grass by strings of dandelions. Your friend is already sitting on one, feet swinging lazily above the shadows. Their face is both familiar and unfamiliar—older around the eyes, younger around the mouth—and it shifts when you try to focus. They pat the space beside them, and the bench drifts closer of its own accord.

“I think we keep arguing because it’s easier than admitting we’re scared,” your friend says, and the fountain nearby nods in a spray of silver leaves. The water climbs instead of falls, collecting in cupped hands of air before pouring back into itself. Your chest feels like the moment right before a lightning strike. You want to say you’re sorry, you want to say you’re right, you want to say you would rather be here with them than anywhere else, even though the path home is unraveling behind you into loose threads of road.

So you decide to do something simple and impossible: you hold out your hand. The air thickens—honey or warm glass—and your friend’s hand meets yours, fingers fitting like they practiced it when you weren’t looking. For a heartbeat, the whole argument softens, folds itself into a paper crane, and flies up to perch on the lamppost. You both watch it tilt its head, listen to it make that tiny creak that means it’s alive.

“I’m scared too,” you say. The moths return to your mouth and settle there like quiet thoughts. “But I don’t want to win. I want to understand.”

The sidewalks, relieved, draw a straight line between you. The cat steps onto the crosswalk, and the painted stripes ripple like a lake. The signal changes to a symbol you don’t recognize but somehow trust. Your friend laughs, unexpected and bright, and the benches let go of their dandelion strings and float up, like applause that finally took a breath.

“Okay,” they say. “Then ask me what you’re afraid to ask.”

You ask. The question is a ladder that extends from the tip of your tongue into a sky that opens like a book. Your friend climbs as they answer, and you climb after them, and the ladder keeps building itself out of everything you’ve said to each other and everything you didn’t. Below, the park folds into a pocket, the streetlights close their eyes, and the cat curls into a comma at the end of the night.

When you both reach the top, there isn’t a top—just a clear place where the air is thinner and your voices sound like bells dropped in snow. You sit with your legs dangling over the edge of the unfinished question. The argument is so small now it can ride the wind without falling apart. You look over, meet your friend’s shifting, steady face, and you both start to laugh—because of how fragile it was, and how strong, and how you carried it all this way to set it down.

The sun arrives from the wrong direction, quiet as a secret. You decide to hold onto this feeling when you wake, knowing that you won’t, but also that some part of you will remember: the way a hand can become a bridge; the way a word can turn into a wing and choose, finally, to fly in the same direction.
