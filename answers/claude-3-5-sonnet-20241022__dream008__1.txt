Let me continue this anxiety dream scenario:

I find myself paralyzed with a mixture of panic and determination. As I try to speak to my boss, I notice my voice comes out as a whisper, and the office around me begins to shift and distort. The walls seem to breathe, and my computer screen displays symbols I've never seen before.

Desperately trying to meet the deadline, I begin working, but every time I complete a task, three more appear. My desk starts expanding endlessly into the horizon, piled with papers that need my attention. The clock on the wall spins wildly - sometimes forward, sometimes backward.

My coworkers walk past me, but their faces are blurred, and they move in strange, jerky motions. I try to ask them for help, but they dissolve into wisps of smoke whenever I get close.

Suddenly, I realize I'm working on my laptop underwater, yet somehow I can breathe. Fish swim through the office carrying urgent memos, and my boss has transformed into a giant octopus wearing a tie, still waiting expectantly for the project's completion...

(This is how I would imagine this classic work anxiety dream might continue, incorporating surreal elements typical of dream logic and anxiety about workplace performance)
