…hesitate at first, unsure if you can trust them. But something in their eyes—an unspoken warmth—makes you take a step forward. They guide you through twisting alleyways that seem to shift and rearrange themselves, the buildings bending and stretching like they're listening to your footsteps.  

As you walk, the noise of the city grows distant, replaced by the gentle hum of voices sharing stories you somehow already know—stories about you, about choices you haven’t made yet. You begin to realize that they’re not just helping you find your way through the city; they’re leading you somewhere deeper, somewhere hidden.  

You turn a corner and arrive at a small, glowing courtyard, impossible to imagine in the middle of the city. In the center is a fountain, its water flowing upward into the sky like liquid light. One of the strangers, a woman with hair the color of twilight, whispers, *"This is where you choose."*  

The others quietly fade away into the shadows, leaving you alone with the fountain and the sound of your own heartbeat.  

Do you want me to continue this dream into its ending, or turn it into something more surreal and symbolic?
