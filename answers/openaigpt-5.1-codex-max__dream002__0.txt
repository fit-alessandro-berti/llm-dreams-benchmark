…and the trees seem to lean in as if they too are listening. The sky, which had been a gentle blue a moment before, bruises purple and green, and a low rumble rolls through the earth and up into your bones. Leaves lift and dance around you, not falling but spiraling upwards, caught in an invisible current.

Instinctively, you look for shelter, but instead of fleeing, your feet root to the damp moss and you realize you are not afraid. The wind wraps around you like a familiar cloak. The first drops fall, but they are not wet; they are cool sparks that fizz on your skin, tiny luminescent beads that burst into butterflies on contact. Thunder cracks again, and for a heartbeat the entire forest is illuminated in white, every twig and fern outlined with light as thin as spider silk.

Then the storm breaks open completely. Sheets of silver pour down, except they don't hit the ground. They hang in the air around you, strands of rain like harp strings. When you reach out and run your fingers through them, a sound blooms — notes of music that you have always known but could never hum when awake. Lightning doesn't strike; it curls lazily down like a ribbon, wraps itself around a tree, and turns into a ladder reaching up through the churning clouds.

Curious, weightless, you climb. Each rung vibrates under your palms, humming with the heartbeat of the storm. Above the canopy, you emerge into a sea of mist shot through with stars. The storm is no longer outside you; it pulses from your chest, a swirling galaxy of light and thunder. Below, the forest is a living patchwork of emerald and shadow. Above, the sky tears open into a million shimmering eyes.

You take one more step into the cloud and you are falling, flying, dissolving into rain and wind and music. Just before you disappear, you laugh, because you remember that you are dreaming, and in this dream you are the storm.
