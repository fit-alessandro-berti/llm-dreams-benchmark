### **Dream Continuation:**

---

You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to **feel a strange mix of excitement and dread.** The lights are blindingly bright, and the microphone in your hand feels unusually heavy, as if it’s pulling you down with invisible weight.

You glance down at the paper in your other hand—your speech notes—but the words have started to **melt into swirling lines of color**, like ink dissolving in water. You try to focus, but the faces in the audience begin to shift. One moment they are strangers, the next they are **familiar faces from your past—teachers, old friends, people you’ve lost touch with.** Some smile encouragingly; others stare with silent judgment.

You raise the microphone to speak, but your voice catches in your throat. When you finally manage to make a sound, it doesn’t come out as words—it’s a **low, resonant hum that echoes strangely across the room**, filling the space with a vibration that seems to shift the air itself.

Suddenly, the stage begins to **tilt.** You lose your balance and stumble backward, and for a moment, you’re sure you’ll fall into the void behind you. But instead of falling, you **float.** You’re lifted gently into the air, hovering just above the stage, suspended like a leaf in a breeze.

From this new vantage point, you see the audience not as individuals, but as **trees in a vast forest**, each one rooted in their own quiet world. And above you, the ceiling of the venue has vanished, replaced by a **limitless night sky** dotted with stars that pulse in rhythm with your heartbeat.

A voice—not yours, but one that feels like it’s coming from everywhere and nowhere—speaks:  
> “You do not need words to be understood. You only need to be seen.”

And then, without thinking, you **open your arms wide** and begin to **glow.** The light doesn’t blind—they illuminate, casting gentle radiance over every face below. The crowd, once silent and still, begins to **nod in unison**, their eyes softening, their expressions shifting from expectation to peace.

You realize now that the speech was never about convincing them—it was about **connecting.** And in this moment, above the stage, above the noise, above the fear, you finally **understand.**
