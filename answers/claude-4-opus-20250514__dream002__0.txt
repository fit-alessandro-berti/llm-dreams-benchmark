...the trees begin to whisper in a language you somehow understand. The wind carries their words: \amer returns.\ instead of white, it pulses in deep purples and golds. Each flash reveals that the forest is transforming—the bark of the trees is becoming translucent, showing galaxies swirling within their trunks.

You realize you're not getting wet despite the rain. Looking down, you see the raindrops are actually tiny silver fish, swimming through the air around you. One brushes against your hand and suddenly you remember—you've been here before, in another dream, in another life.

The storm intensifies, but you feel no fear. Instead, you spread your arms wide and let yourself rise with the wind. As you float upward through the canopy, you see that the entire forest is actually growing from the shell of an enormous sleeping turtle, drifting through an ocean of stars.

Thunder rolls, but it sounds like laughter. The turtle's ancient eye opens, meeting yours, and you understand that you are both the dreamer and the dream. The storm was simply the universe's way of welcoming you home.

You continue floating higher, becoming one with the cosmic rain, knowing that when you wake, a part of this peace will remain with you.
