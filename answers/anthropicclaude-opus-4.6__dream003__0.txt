# The Dreaming Box

You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and symbols etched into the dark wood — spirals that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them, constellations you almost recognize, and a script that feels like it's on the tip of your tongue but belongs to no language you've ever studied.

Your fingers trace one of the spirals, and it's **warm**.

The box hums — not audibly, but somewhere behind your ribs, like a second heartbeat syncing with yours. The symbols begin to rearrange themselves, flowing like mercury across the surface, and you realize with dream-certainty that **the box is reading you**.

It's not looking for a key. It's looking for an *answer*.

The patterns settle into a single question mark that looks ancient and alive. And then a voice — not heard but *understood* — asks:

*"What have you carried so long you've forgotten it isn't part of you?"*

The answer rises before you can think. Not a word but a feeling — something heavy and familiar that's lived in your chest for years, something you'd mistaken for just... the weight of being yourself.

You whisper it.

The box **unfolds** — not opens, *unfolds* — like an origami flower blooming in reverse-time, each panel revealing another impossible layer beneath. Inside, there is light — not golden, not white, but a color you can only see in dreams and will ache to remember when you wake.

Resting in that light is... something small. Something you lost so long ago you forgot it existed.

You reach for it.

Your fingertips brush its surface — and you feel, for one perfect and unbearable moment, **exactly like yourself.**

*The dream is already dissolving. The color is fading. But your hand is closed around something, and even as you surface toward waking, some part of you is whispering:*

*Don't let go. Don't let go. Don't let—*

*You wake up. Your hand is empty.*

*But lighter.*
