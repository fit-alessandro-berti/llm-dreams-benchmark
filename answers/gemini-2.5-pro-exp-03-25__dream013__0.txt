Okay, sinking deeper into the dream...

You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, you **begin to notice the logic itself is becoming fluid, almost slippery.** What worked for one puzzle door – a sequence of prime numbers, perhaps – is useless on the next, which seems to demand an answer based on the *feeling* of colours or the rhythm of your own anxious heartbeat.

The stone walls of the maze cease to be just stone. They shimmer faintly, textures shifting under your fingertips from smooth obsidian to coarse, breathing moss. The air grows thick, not with dust, but with the scent of forgotten memories and ozone, and you hear faint whispers that seem to echo the frantic calculations inside your own head, twisting them into riddles.

You start to lose track of time, of self. The intense concentration required warps your perception. Are the puzzles reflections of your own mind, becoming more abstract and personal as you delve further? Or is the maze itself alive, learning you, adapting its challenges not just to test your logic, but to probe your fears, your hopes, your very sense of reality? The goal – escape? The center? – becomes hazy, less important than the hypnotic, unnerving process of engaging with the next impossible lock, the next shifting corridor, feeling less like you are solving the puzzles, and more like the puzzles are fundamentally rewriting *you*. The further you go, the less certain you are that you want to wake up.
