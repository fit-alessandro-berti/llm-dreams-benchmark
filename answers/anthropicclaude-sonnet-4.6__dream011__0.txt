...written in a language you've never seen before. Not quite Latin, not quite anything. The letters seem to breathe, subtly rearranging themselves each time you blink.

You look around the exam room. Everyone else has their heads down, pencils scratching confidently across paper. The fluorescent lights hum at a frequency that feels personal, almost accusatory.

You look back at your paper.

Somehow, you understand the first question now.

*"Describe the weight of a decision you never made."*

Your pencil moves before your mind does. Words pour out of you in handwriting that isn't quite yours — slightly more elegant, slightly more honest. You write about a door you stood in front of once. You never mentioned it to anyone. You barely admitted it to yourself.

You turn the page.

The second question is a diagram. You are supposed to label its parts. The diagram appears to be **you** — not your body exactly, but something structural. The architecture of how you became who you are. There are blank arrows pointing to things like the summer you were eleven, and a specific Tuesday in your twenties, and something labeled only *"the almost."*

You label them all. It takes no time at all, because you already know.

The third question simply reads:

*"What are you afraid the answer is?"*

The room gets very quiet. Even the fluorescent lights hold their breath.

Your pencil hovers.

And outside the window — which shouldn't exist because you're on the fourteenth floor of a building you've never been in — a bird lands on the sill and looks at you with an expression that suggests it has *all the time in the world.*

You realize, slowly, that the exam isn't testing what you know.

It's testing whether you're willing to **write it down.**

Your hand begins to move...

*What does it write?*
