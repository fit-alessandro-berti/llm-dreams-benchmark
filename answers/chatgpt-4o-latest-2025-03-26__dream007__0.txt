step outside to cool off. As you leave the room, the door doesn't lead into the hallway like it normally should—it opens into a vast, starlit field, soft grass glowing faintly under your bare feet. You hesitate, but something pulls you forward.

Your friend follows, the argument momentarily forgotten as the surreal landscape washes over both of you. In the distance, a tree made entirely of crystal hums with an unearthly melody, the wind carrying whispers in a language you almost understand.

You and your friend walk side by side in silence for a while. Then, without quite knowing why, you both begin to laugh—quietly at first, then louder, the remnants of the argument dissolving into stardust around you. The tree pulses once, sending a gentle wave of light that briefly connects your hearts, making everything else feel small and far away.

You turn to your friend to speak, but your voice is a song instead, and they respond with a chorus of color flowing from their hands. Communication without words. Understanding without explanation.

And just as you begin to remember what the argument was about…

You wake up.
