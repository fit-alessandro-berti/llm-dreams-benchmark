You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **adapt quickly or perish in this unforgiving medieval world**.

The air is thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth. Cobblestone streets wind between timber-framed houses, and villagers in rough woolen tunics haggle over baskets of turnips and loaves of coarse bread at a bustling market square. No smartphones, no cars—just the clip-clop of horse-drawn carts and the distant clang of a blacksmith's hammer.

Your modern clothes draw suspicious stares. A burly guard with a halberd eyes you warily, muttering about "outlandish garb." Hunger gnaws at your stomach, and your pockets yield only lint—no wallet, no ID. You spot a tavern spilling raucous laughter and the gleam of tankards. Survival demands cunning.

Slipping into the crowd, you barter a shiny button from your shirt (ripped from your jacket) for a hunk of bread and watery ale. The barkeep squints: "Stranger from afar? Got skills?" Desperation sparks an idea—you recall half-forgotten history lessons. Feigning confidence, you claim to be a traveling tinker with "wondrous knowledge from the East."

By nightfall, you've bartered stories of "flying ships" (airplanes, reimagined) for a straw pallet and a rusty dagger. Whispers spread: you're a sage, a wizard even. But danger looms—a shadowy figure in the alley watches, fingering a poisoned blade. Is it a thief, a spy for the local lord... or something from your own subconscious?

As you huddle by a flickering hearth, plotting your next move—forge alliances, invent gunpowder basics, or seek a way home?—the world blurs. The tavern spins into mist. You jolt awake in your bed, heart pounding, the echo of medieval chants fading. Just a dream... or was it?
