My boots slipped on the deck, the rain stinging my face. Around me, the storm raged, flinging the ship like a toy in the tumultuous waves. The men, faces pale beneath the lantern light, struggled to keep their footing, their expressions a mixture of fear and adrenaline-fueled determination.

I clung to the helm, the wood slick beneath my hand. "Hold fast!" I roared above the howl of the wind, the words plucked by the crashing waves, "Captain needs to see the stars!"

The hum of fear turns into a murmur of something like dread as the first mate, a grizzled veteran named Finn, raises an eyebrow over my ridiculous orders.

"Aye, Captain," he grits out, his grease-painted face etched with disbelief, "but the skies are blacker than the hold." 

He was right. The relentless storm had swallowed the sun, leaving behind a sky the colour of stormy slate.

"Then clear a path to the stars!" I shout back, my frustration battling the salty wind. My voice is hoarse, punctuated by fits of coughing.

Finn has followed me for years, his skepticism waning as the storm grows stronger. He's seen worse, I remind myself, eyes darting to the churning waves before returning to the vast, starless expanse above. This, above the howling wind and the smell of impending rain, is different from the fear that gripped the crew in past storms.

This, I see now, looking at Finn's hardened gaze, this calm amidst the storm… this is something new.

He complains, "There ain't no stars in this weather, Captain. Not even the gulls can see through this thick fog."

I smile. "See, Finn, my jibe was effective. They're all lookin' up to the Captain now, eh? Well, then, navigate to it, old friend. The Captain trusts your instincts will push through. Just like they always do."

I pat him on the shoulder, the gesture warm despite the storm swirling around us. The rain, surprisingly warm on Finn's weathered face, finally parted, revealing a canvas of stars above, shimmering through the drying storm clouds. "Light up the path to the squid, lad! Us veteran sailors will show 'em how it's done!" 

My words were a joke, a release valve for the tension, but there was no feathered laughter from Finn or the thirty weathered men who made up our crew. Only grim, silent faces, looking wearily at a last chance of a clear finary sky, excluding the occasional flicker of lightning, illuminating the angsty faces of my weary crew. 

There was a spark of something in his eyes, though, a fleeting flicker of defiance that morphed into something deeper, something like fearlessness. The same unyielding bravery that allowed him to navigate us through the thickest fogs, the gloomiest nights. The creaking and groaning of the ship was deafening now, and every man on board could feel the ship trembling before the first mate timidly placed his hand on my shoulder, a surprising warmth radiating from his gruffness, and nervously said, "But Captain, what if there aren't any stars overhead?"

He glances towards the front, fear now widening in his eyes, "There wouldn't be a ship up here that can trust my hunch"

My heart sank. The thought of the crew doubting his judgement, the wind whipping around us a reminder of his own stubborn questions about nautical myth versus scientific truth can't distract me. We were heading into a realm where myth rained true – the Kraken Sea filled with perpetual fog. This was not a place for folklore, not if the aim is to believe only in what's real.

"The Kraken Sea, that's wherever the Captain fears not." Maya, a young cabin girl, banged her tankard on the table, breaking the silence. "We need wood for the ship, aye Captain?" The men nodded grimly, doubt etched on each of their faces. 

I looked at them, at Finn, their body language mirroring their unease. I knew he wanted to restrict the curse.

. "Aye," he whispered, the storm finally seeming to echo the tempest inside of him. "The Kraken Sea, prime hunting grounds for truth, aye? Seems the old tales are right."

Then, the sun, a faint sliver peeking through the clearing clouds, hurt the eyes, yet it was the things beneath it, hidden in the churning seas below the deck that the majority of their fear lay with.

As they mutter about moving onward with their quarry, the seagull's gaze falls upon the fog parting outside, the Attic as a whole started to flinch. How could they fail to see that the hesitation of the others offered no comfort to those staring into the drenched, cold night at the seemingly monstrous shape surfacing from the depths beneath them?

I leaned down, staring at the Captain's anxious face. "They're afraid of the stories, Hamachi," I said, my voice even gentler than the first mate's usual gruff tone. "Although they may not believe them, they fear them nonetheless. See, the legend is true, see?" I pointed to the massive twig jutting out of the water," said they struggled with a gnarled, wooden leg. Against the deck, formed by the milling shadows of the plethora of boats amidst the chop of the sea, Horatio, a grizzled monstrosity of a ship, chipped in with a splintery groan as ata

I felt a pang of pity for the flimsy vessel, his heart overflowing with fear and their imaginations," he said, his burly hand unconsciously tightening around the nets on the ship's mast. They understood the sea’s whims on a far deeper level. I felt a strange sense of humility facing the legend they feared.  "The Kraken isn't something to be trusted." He growled.

I hand him a rusty, yet beautiful, lantern.

"The legends speak of whispered rumors" he whispered which is to use to fuel your lamp. Lamplight, ages ago, was said to drive it away. Something isn't right. It’s…when I mentioned your name…the gargantuan Kraken, whispering like the ghosts of the very sea we sail," began the story says a revelation, a shivering whisper creeped to her throat. The laughter of the master,"I had only rigged this poor ship to fear my fascination with the sea.

Please provide a clear, and golden rays of the sun, they warned.



And so, the dying light faded to a dull red as the Kraken lanes slashed the surface. "The wind is strongest here, in the northern atmosphere," called Jim, clenching onto her voice. "There’s such a thing."

This, however, wouldn't be the ideal fishing trip," you snip back, leading the Captain away from the railing.

"Better not believe the fish too, ain't it?" with the truth.
