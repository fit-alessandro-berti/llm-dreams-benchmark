The air in the grand hall is thick with the scent of perfume and a low, warm hum of a hundred conversations. You remember your friend's text: "Look for the red tie." A simple instruction, now feeling like a map to a single star in a crowded sky.

You drift past a cluster of people debating animatedly, their hands clutching wine glasses that catch the light. One of them catches your eye and offers a polite, questioning smile. You smile back, a tight, fleeting gesture, and keep moving, a ship on a quiet current.

Next, you hover at the edge of a group laughing uproariously at a story you can't hear. Their unity feels like a wall. You search for a flash of red among them—nothing—and your own solitude sharpens in contrast.

Then, you see it. A splash of crimson silk, partly obscured by a potted fern near the tall windows. Relief washes over you, a cool wave. You maneuver through the crowd, your path finally clear.

But as you round the fern, you stop.

It's not them. It's a stranger, a man with a red tie, talking earnestly to someone else. The disappointment is a physical weight, dropping into your stomach. You turn away, disoriented.

And that's when you hear it—your name, called with familiar delight. You spin around.

There they are, your friend, smiling from across the room. And they are not wearing a red tie at all. They are wearing a vibrant, emerald-green scarf. They wave you over, and as you move toward them, you catch your own reflection in a dark window.

You are the one wearing the red tie.
