You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you… felt a strange calmness settle over me. It wasn’t bravery, not exactly. It was…recognition. I’d been here before. Not on *this* ship, not with *these* faces, but in a dream like this, facing a similar fury. 

The waves were monstrous, clawing at the *Sea Serpent’s Kiss*, our brigantine. Rain lashed down, blinding even with the oilskins pulled tight. Old Man Hemlock, our first mate, a man who’d weathered a hundred storms, gripped the railing, his knuckles white. He shouted over the roar, “Captain! We need to reef the topsails! She’ll capsize if we don’t!”

I nodded, but didn’t issue the order. Instead, I walked to the ship’s wheel, my hands finding the worn wood with a familiarity that surprised even me. I didn’t *steer* so much as *listen*. The wood hummed beneath my palms, a low thrumming vibration that resonated in my bones. 

“Hold fast!” I bellowed, my voice somehow cutting through the storm. “Don’t touch the sails! Don’t bail! Just…hold fast!”

A murmur of confusion rippled through the crew. Hemlock looked at me like I’d lost my mind. “Captain, with all due respect…that’s madness!”

I ignored him. I focused on the humming in the wheel, letting it guide my hands. It wasn’t a logical course, not one charted on any map. We weren’t fighting *against* the storm, we were…dancing with it. I felt the ship lurch and groan, but not in protest. It was a yielding, a bending, a flowing with the chaos.

Then, through a momentary break in the rain, I saw it. Not land, not another ship, but a swirling vortex of light, a shimmering, iridescent eye opening in the heart of the storm. It wasn’t frightening. It was…inviting. 

The ship, as if guided by an unseen hand, began to turn, slowly, inexorably, towards the light. The turbulence didn’t lessen, but it *changed*. It felt less like destruction and more like…cleansing. 

As we drew closer, the light intensified, and the ship began to *dissolve*. Not break apart, but become…less solid. The wood felt warm, almost liquid. The faces of my crew blurred, their expressions shifting from fear to wonder. 

I closed my eyes, bracing for…something. A crash? Oblivion? But instead, I felt a sensation of falling, not downwards, but *inwards*. A feeling of being pulled apart and reassembled, of shedding layers of myself I didn’t even know I possessed.

Then, silence.

I opened my eyes. I wasn’t on the *Sea Serpent’s Kiss* anymore. I wasn’t even on the sea. I was standing on a beach of black sand, under a sky filled with two moons. And beside me, looking equally bewildered, stood Old Man Hemlock, his oilskins gone, replaced by simple linen clothes. 

He looked at me, his jaw slack. “Captain…where…where are we?”

I looked at the strange, alien landscape, and a slow smile spread across my face. “I don’t know, Hemlock,” I said. “But I have a feeling this is where we were *meant* to be.”



And then, a voice, not from anywhere and everywhere, whispered in my ear, “The storm wasn’t the destination, Captain. It was the key.”



And I knew, with a certainty that defied logic, that the real journey had just begun.



Then, my alarm clock blared, and I woke up, heart pounding, the scent of salt and something…else, something ancient and unknown, lingering in the air.
