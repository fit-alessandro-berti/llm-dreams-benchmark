...freeze, transfixed by the sudden stillness of the room. The fluorescent lights overhead buzz with the sound of angry hornets, and the calendar on the wall is cracked, with the days simply melting down the glass like candle wax.

Your boss taps his fingers against the glass surface of his desk—his hands are transparent, flickering like ghostly flames whenever he touches down. He slides a thick, heavy manila folder across the desk to you. It looks heavy, but when you try to pick it up, it feels light as a feather and smells faintly of ozone and rain. You open it, expecting a list of tasks, but inside you find only a single, pulsating, black stone that seems to hold your reflection. The stone throbs in time with your own heartbeat.

"We need to finish this before the hourglass runs dry," he says, but his mouth doesn't move; the voice vibrates through the floorboards, rattling your teeth.

You stare at the stone, the pressure of the deadline feeling like a physical weight on your chest. But then you notice the floorboards are dissolving into clear blue water. Instead of reaching for a pen, you find yourself sitting cross-legged on the floor. The water rises, covering your ankles, then your knees.

A bizarre sense of calm washes over you. You realize the project isn't something you can do; it's something you have to *be*. With a deep breath, you stop trying to solve the impossible equation on the screen and simply start to breathe. As you breathe, your office transforms into a vast, deep ocean. The ceiling vanishes, replaced by a bright, golden sun. You drift backward, weightless, letting the current of the dream take you, finally free from the constraints of the schedule, floating into a world without time.
