…dart through the neon-lit streets, heart pounding as the minute hand sweeps closer to the appointed hour. The city around you pulses with strange energy—towering spires blink like watchful eyes, and enormous holographic signs scroll messages in alphabets you almost recognize but can’t quite read.

You quicken your pace, weaving between a parade of impossibly tall pedestrians whose shadows stretch like ribbons down the sidewalks. Every corner brings a new challenge: a market square where vendors barter floating orbs of light for promises; a silent plaza dominated by a fountain that sprays luminous mist instead of water; a narrow stairway that seems to ascend into the clouds only to fold back on itself.

As you glance at your wrist, the timekeeper’s hand flickers—eight minutes to go. You realize you’re clutching nothing but a crumpled, half-visible address scrawled on a scrap of paper. You race on, turning left at a colossal archway shaped like an open book, then ducking under a glass canopy where raindrops fall upward. Each footfall echoes with an uncanny resonance, as if the city itself is guiding you.

Suddenly you come upon an intersection of mirrors: four giant panes set like crossroads, each reflecting a different version of yourself—confident, confused, triumphant, and forlorn. You pause, breathless, and a whisper ripples through the glass: “The path reveals itself when you stop seeking.” Heart thudding, you step back—and in that instant, one mirror swings aside like a secret door.

Behind it is a narrow corridor lit by softly glowing runes in a language you somehow understand: “The Council Room—Level Zero.” Relief floods you. You hurry in, and the corridor opens onto a soaring hall where dozens of figures sit around a long, iridescent table. Their faces blur and shift—some human, some animal, some entirely unfamiliar. They turn in unison as you enter, and a hush falls.

You cross to the head of the table. All eyes are on you. In your hand, the scrap of paper flutters open, revealing the company logo you recognize, the tagline you rehearsed. Though your pulse races, a calm settles over you as you place it down. You realize you have exactly thirty seconds before the meeting begins.

Then, just as the first question is about to be asked, you bolt upright in bed—heart racing, with the dawn light streaming through your window. An hour has passed in the real world. You check your phone:—you’re right on time. And somehow, you know exactly where to go.
