...a blank canvas and a single, shimmering paintbrush resting beside it.

The brush seems to call to you. It's not made of wood, but of solidified moonlight, and the bristles are woven from what looks like captured whispers. The chaos of the shifting world around you—the mountains that melt into rivers, the sky that pulses with shades of bruised purple and liquid gold—seems to quieten, focusing on this stark, silent white.

You feel an inexplicable compulsion. You pick up the brush. It feels warm in your hand, humming with a gentle vibration. There are no paints, no palette, but you know that doesn't matter. You lift the brush to the canvas, intending to paint something, anything, to give this silent space a voice.

The moment the tip touches the surface, the canvas doesn't take a color. Instead, a ripple spreads out from the point of contact, like a stone dropped in a placid lake of milk. The white surface becomes liquid, swirling softly. A face begins to form in the milky depths—your face, but not quite. It's a version of you made of starlight and forgotten melodies, its eyes holding a deep, ancient calm.

The starlight face smiles, and you feel a gentle pull. The world of shifting shapes and colors dissolves into a roar as you fall forward, tumbling *through* the canvas.

The landing is soft, like falling into a cloud of quiet thought.

You are now in a gallery of moments. All around you are frames, but they don't hold pictures. Each frame holds a feeling, a sound, a scent. One frame holds the warmth of the first truly sunny day after a long winter. Another emits the low, comforting rumble of a cat's purr and smells of old books. A third contains the sharp, bittersweet ache of a goodbye, shimmering as a single, sustained violin note.

You walk through this hall of your own history, a museum of your soul. You are both the visitor and the exhibit. At the end of the long hall, the starlit version of you is waiting. It doesn't speak, but it holds out the moonlight brush to you once more.

A new, empty frame materializes on the wall beside it.

The understanding dawns on you, clear and peaceful as the space you're in: the chaotic, shifting world outside was just the noise. This place, this gallery of your own making, is the truth. And you have a choice. You can add a new moment to the wall, paint a new feeling into existence.

You take the brush. You don't dip it in any color. You simply turn to the empty frame. You think of the future, of a joy you haven't felt yet, of a peace you hope to find.

You lift the brush, and as you do, the gallery begins to fade. The scent of old books and the warmth of the sun-drenched frame dissolve into the familiar weight of your blanket. The single, sustained violin note of goodbye becomes the gentle hum of the morning world outside your window.

You open your eyes, and for a moment, the quiet morning light seems to hold a faint, shimmering color you've never seen before. The blank canvas of the day awaits.
