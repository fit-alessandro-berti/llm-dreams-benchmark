…written in a language that keeps shape-shifting.

The first line looks like English—“What is the substance of memory?”—but before you finish reading it the letters wobble into Cyrillic, then smear themselves into Arabic calligraphy, then melt into musical notes that hang humming in the air above the page. You glance around the auditorium: every other student’s desk is glowing with a soft halo, their questions still and legible, while yours continues its restless metamorphosis.

The proctor is a tall figure in a charcoal gown who never shows a face. They drift past your row, robes rustling like dry parchment. A hand appears—neither old nor young—delicately placing an hourglass on your desk. The sand inside it is not sand at all; it’s miniature snowflakes, each flake etched with a word you almost recognize. They’re falling up instead of down.

You take a breath that tastes of ink and thunderstorm, look back at the page, and realize the question has finally settled, but only because it has become a mirror. In it you see yourself, younger, sitting cross-legged on the floor of a childhood bedroom you’d forgotten, building a city from alphabet blocks. Each time you fit a letter to another, a spark jumps, and the city grows a rooftop taller.

The mirror-question ripples. A voice—your own, but many years wiser—whispers from its surface: “Build your own vocabulary. Time is a syllable.”

You reach to touch the page. The moment your fingertip brushes the glass, the exam room fractures like an ice sheet. Desks slide away like floes. The other students disappear one by one—each becomes a constellation on the dark ceiling. Only the hourglass remains, bobbing gently beside you on an ink-black tide that smells of heated metal.

Now there is only you, the mirror-question, and the drifting flakes of up-falling words. You understand suddenly that you must answer by rearranging the snowflakes before they touch the top of the glass. You pluck one from the air: the word “ember.” Another: “arrival.” The two cling together, forming a small, warm star between your fingers. The mirror brightens.

As you reach for the third flake—whatever word it carries—you feel gravity tilt. You are no longer taking the exam; you are becoming the exam, a living manuscript the universe is reading out loud.

Somewhere behind the dark tide you hear a bell ring, not marking an ending but a beginning, and the gown-robed proctor’s voice, gentle for the first time: “Welcome, graduate of your own design.”
