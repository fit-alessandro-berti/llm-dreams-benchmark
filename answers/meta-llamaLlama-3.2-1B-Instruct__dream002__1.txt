...you can hear the distant rumble of thunder and the snapping of branches as the wind picks up. The trees, once swaying gently in the breeze, now creak and groan in the gusts, their leaves rustling and releasing tiny, grey feathers into the air.

As you quicken your pace, the storm begins to gather around you. Dark clouds roll in, their bases blown out by strong gusts, and the rain starts to fall in sheets, drumming against the forest floor. You feel a shiver run down your spine as the wind howls through the trees, causing the branches to sway violently, and leaves to swirl around your head like tiny, dancing dervishes.

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning illuminates the dark sky, casting an eerie glow over the forest. You feel a jolt of fear as you stumble upon a narrow, dark path that winds its way through the trees. The path seems to lead deeper into the forest, and you can feel a sense of foreboding emanating from it.

You try to run, but your feet feel heavy, as if rooted to the spot. The storm rages on, growing stronger and more intense by the second. The lightning flashes again, and you feel a burst of energy course through your veins. You raise your arms, and to your amazement, you find that they can carry you across the churning waters of the forest stream that flows at your feet.

With a jolt of exhilaration, you take a leap of faith and sprint towards the stream, your feet pounding against the water. The storm rages on around you, but you feel a sense of freedom and exhilaration as you splash into the icy waters and begin to swim towards the safety of the stream's edge.

As you emerge on the other side, gasping for air, you see a figure waiting for you on the forest's edge. It's a woman with long, dark hair and piercing green eyes, her skin glistening with rain. She reaches out a hand and touches your forehead, and you feel a sudden surge of clarity and understanding flood through your mind.

The storm begins to recede, the sun breaking through the clouds and casting a warm, golden light over the forest. The trees stand tall and still once more, their leaves rustling softly in the gentle breeze. You look up at the woman and see that she's smiling at you, her eyes sparkling with a hint of mischief.

"Welcome to the forest," she says, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've been waiting for you."
