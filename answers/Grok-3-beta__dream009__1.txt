adapt quickly to survive. The air feels thick with the scent of woodsmoke and earth, and the distant sound of clanging metal echoes through a village square. You glance down at your clothes—somehow, they’ve transformed into rough, hand-stitched garments that itch against your skin. People bustle around you, their faces weathered and their hands calloused, speaking in a dialect that’s strangely familiar yet hard to grasp.
You realize you’re in some medieval hamlet, far from the hum of electricity or the glow of screens. Your stomach growls, and you notice a market nearby, alive with the barter of goods—loaves of coarse bread, bundles of herbs, and freshly slaughtered game. You have no phone, no wallet, nothing modern to trade. A grizzled farmer eyes you suspiciously as you linger near his cart, and you understand that you’ll need to find a way to earn your keep.
Instinct kicks in. You spot a blacksmith hammering away at a forge, his apprentice struggling to keep up. You approach, gesturing to offer help, and though your words stumble, your willingness to work seems to get through. The blacksmith grunts, tossing you a heavy apron, and points to a pile of firewood that needs splitting. As you grip the axe, feeling its weight, you start to piece together a plan—learn their ways, blend in, and figure out how you ended up here. The dream swirls on, pulling you deeper into this rugged, unfamiliar life.
