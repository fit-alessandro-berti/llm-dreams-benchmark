You start to walk briskly down the cobblestone street, the sounds of the city wrapping around you—street vendors calling out in a language you somehow understand but can't place, the distant hum of a tram, and the rustle of papers carried by a wind that smells of rain and fresh bread.

The buildings around you are a strange collage: Art Deco towers stand beside medieval stone churches, their spires piercing a sky that shifts between twilight and dawn like a clock that can't decide what time it is. You check your pocket and find only a crumpled receipt and a brass key with no tag.

A passerby—a woman in a green coat—catches your eye. "You're lost," she says. It isn't a question.

"I'm not lost," you reply, even though you are. "I'm looking for a meeting."

She smiles knowingly. "Everyone here is looking for something. The question is whether you'll find it before the hour runs out."

She points down a narrow alleyway lit by lanterns that have just flickered to life. "The building has no number, but you'll know it by the door. It only appears to those who remember why they're looking."

You thank her—or start to—but when you turn back, she's already gone, absorbed into the crowd that moves like water around you.

You have forty-three minutes.

The alley stretches before you, and you step into its shadows, the city's noise fading to a distant murmur. Somewhere ahead, a door is waiting.

What do you do?
