You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. Emerald grass ripples into sapphire, then dissolves into a field of pulsating orange triangles. Buildings twist and unfurl like blooming flowers, their facades shifting between geometric patterns and recognizable faces that melt before you can truly see them. It’s disorienting, exhilarating, and strangely peaceful. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and…

…a single, silver paintbrush. It doesn’t feel cold to the touch, but vibrates with a low hum, like a sleeping engine. The canvas itself isn’t stretched fabric, but a shimmering, opalescent surface that seems to *breathe* with the same rhythm as the world around you. 

Hesitantly, I reach for the brush. As my fingers wrap around the handle, a voice, not audible but *felt* within my mind, whispers, “What do you miss?”

Miss? The question hangs in the shifting air, heavy with meaning. I hadn’t realized I *was* missing anything, lost as I was in the constant flux. But now… a pang. A longing for something solid, something *known*. 

I dip the brush into… nothing. There’s no paint, no pigment. Yet, as I bring it to the canvas, a color begins to bloom. Not a color I’ve ever seen before, but one that resonates deep within my chest. It’s the color of my grandmother’s garden, the scent of honeysuckle and warm earth. 

I paint a single, perfect rose. 

As the last petal takes form, the rose doesn’t just *appear* on the canvas. It extends, three-dimensional, its velvety texture real enough to touch. And with it, a wave of memory washes over me – the feel of my grandmother’s hand in mine, the sound of her laughter, the taste of her raspberry jam.

Encouraged, I paint again. This time, a worn, leather-bound book, the one my father used to read to me before bed. It materializes, smelling of old paper and pipe tobacco. Opening it, I find the familiar illustrations, the stories unfolding before my eyes as if I were a child again.

Each stroke of the brush doesn’t create an image, it *reconstructs* a memory, a feeling, a lost piece of myself. The canvas isn’t just a surface for art, it’s a portal to everything I’ve ever cherished. 

But as I paint, I notice something unsettling. The world around me is beginning to *fade*. The vibrant chaos is dimming, becoming muted, almost grayscale. The voice whispers again, “To create, you must choose. To remember, you must let go.”

The realization hits me with a chilling clarity. This world of constant change, of endless possibility, is fueled by forgetting. By letting go of the past. And by bringing the past back, I’m… unraveling it. 

Do I continue to rebuild my memories, to hold onto what I’ve lost, even if it means the destruction of this extraordinary, if unsettling, reality? Or do I put down the brush, embrace the flux, and let the colors and shapes continue their endless dance?



The silver brush feels heavier in my hand now, the weight of a choice I don't know how to make. And then, a single, iridescent tear rolls down my cheek, landing on the canvas, and…



…I wake up.
