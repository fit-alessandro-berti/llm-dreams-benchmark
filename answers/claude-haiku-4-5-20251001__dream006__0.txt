# The Speech

...open your mouth, but instead of words, soft music emerges—a melody you've never heard before but somehow always known. The audience doesn't seem to mind. They're swaying now.

As I look down at the podium, I realize it's made of water. My notes are dissolving, but that's okay because I can see the words floating up into the air like luminous fish, reorganizing themselves into something I actually need to say.

A woman in the third row smiles at me, and I notice she has my mother's eyes—except my mother is sitting two rows over, also smiling. They're both waiting.

I open my mouth again. This time, I speak—not words exactly, but colors. Deep blues and warm ambers spill out, and somehow everyone understands perfectly. They're nodding, laughing, some are crying.

The stage begins to shift beneath my feet. It's no longer a stage—it's a bridge, and there's a river below that glows softly. I'm no longer nervous. I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, saying exactly what needs to be said.

Someone in the crowd starts clapping, and the sound echoes like bells...

*What happens next in your dream?*
