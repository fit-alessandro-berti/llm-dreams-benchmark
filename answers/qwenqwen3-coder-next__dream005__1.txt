You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and—  

…a child in a yellow raincoat, standing utterly still in the center of a sun-dappled courtyard, whispering to a flock of pigeons that hover just above their shoulders, wings flickering like folded paper. The child turns, not with surprise, but with recognition, and points not at you, but *through* you, toward a wrought-iron gate that wasn’t there a moment ago. Beyond it, the rest of the crowd dissolves into watercolor—their voices softening to distant piano notes, their faces blurring like brushstrokes in wet paint.

You follow the gesture, heart thudding, and step through the gate—only to find yourself in a library suspended among ancient trees, their roots coiling around towering shelves. Dust motes swirl in shafts of amber light. There, by a window framing a sky streaked with the colors of a dying sunset, stands your one friend—except now they’re wearing your face.  

They smile, not mockingly, but warmly, like you’ve finally arrived at a long-delayed appointment. “Took you long enough,” they say—and their voice is unmistakably yours, yet layered with something older, quieter. “The real gathering starts now.”

The shelves behind them begin to hum, glowing faintly gold, and the spine of every book pulses with a soft, rhythmic light—*like a heartbeat made visible*.  

You wake—just as your own hand lifts, as if drawn by the light, toward the nearest open book.

*(The dream doesn’t end. It waits.)*
