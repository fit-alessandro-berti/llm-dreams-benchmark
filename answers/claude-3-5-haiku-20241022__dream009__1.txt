I'll continue the dream narrative:

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to adapt quickly to survive. The landscape is unfamiliar - rolling hills covered in tall grass, with distant mountains and a small wooden settlement nearby. Your clothing feels rough and handmade, unlike anything you've worn before.

You notice a leather satchel near you with some basic tools: a knife, a flint, some dried herbs, and what looks like a hand-drawn map. The air is crisp and clean, filled with sounds of distant wildlife and the occasional clanging of metal from what seems to be a blacksmith's workshop.

Your first priority is to understand where - and when - you are. The clothing and tools suggest you might be in medieval times, perhaps in a rural European setting. You'll need to gather information, find shelter, and figure out how to survive in this completely alien environment.
