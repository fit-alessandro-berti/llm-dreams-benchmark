You start to ask passersby for directions, but every time you open your mouth, only bubbles come out—like you’re underwater, even though the air feels perfectly normal. People glance at you politely and keep walking, as if silent bubble-blowing strangers are just part of big-city life.

Frantic, you pull out your phone to check the mysterious calendar invite that simply says “THE MEETING – don’t be late.” The address field is blank except for a single emoji: 🌀. When you tap it, the map app opens and the blue dot that’s supposed to be you starts spinning in frantic circles, faster and faster, until the whole screen turns into a whirlpool and sucks the phone out of your hand. It vanishes with a soft *plop*, like it dove into an invisible pool.

Now properly panicked, you sprint down the nearest street. The buildings begin to lean inward, their windows blinking like curious eyes. Street signs twist and rewrite themselves as you approach: “Turn Left to Definitely Make It On Time” becomes “Turn Left to Maybe Make It On Time” and finally “Turn Left to Regret Everything.” You ignore them and keep running.

Eventually you skid into a massive plaza dominated by a single clock tower. The hands are racing backward. A small child holding a balloon shaped like a briefcase tugs your sleeve and whispers, “You’reedn’t worry. The meeting is wherever you are when you stop looking for it.”

You blink, and suddenly you’re seated at a polished obsidian table in a room with no doors. Across from you sits… yourself, but wearing a sharp suit and an expression of mild disappointment.

“You’re late,” dream-you says, tapping a watch that has no hands. “We were supposed to discuss why you keep scheduling things with yourself and then forgetting where you put them.”

You open your mouth to explain—no bubbles this time—but before a word comes out, the alarm clock on your real-nightstand blares and the city dissolves into ceiling plaster and morning light.

You wake up sweaty, heart pounding, and immediately check your calendar.

There really is a meeting in an hour.

The location just says 🌀.
