...feel the deck lurch beneath your boots as a wall of black water rises against the starboard side. The lantern swings wildly from the mast, casting jagged shadows across the faces of your crew — each one pale, rain-slicked, eyes wide with something between trust and terror.

You grip the helm so tightly your knuckles ache, but your voice comes out steady — steadier than you feel.

**"Reef the mainsail! Secure the cargo hold! I need every hand on the lines — NOW!"**

The crew scatters into the howling dark, and for a moment you are alone with the storm. The wind screams something that almost sounds like words — like the sea is *asking you a question* you don't quite understand.

Then something strange happens.

The ocean below begins to glow — a deep, phosphorescent blue, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath the waves. The compass on the helm spins wildly, then stops, pointing somewhere that isn't north. Somewhere *below.*

Your first mate stumbles up beside you, gripping the railing. She shouts over the wind: **"Captain — that's not natural. We should turn back."**

But you *know* — the way you know things in dreams — that turning back leads nowhere. The port you left is gone. The map is blank behind you.

The only way is *through.*

You lash yourself to the wheel and steer directly into the heart of the glowing water. The ship groans. The crew shouts. The sea opens —

— and suddenly, silence.

The storm vanishes. The ship drifts into an impossible calm — a cathedral of mist where the water is glass-still and the sky is full of unfamiliar stars. Islands float in the air above you, trailing waterfalls that fall upward. A whale breaches in the distance, but it moves through the sky, not the sea.

Your crew stares in stunned silence.

Your first mate looks at you, breathless. **"Where are we?"**

You release the wheel. Your hands are trembling, but you smile.

**"Somewhere the maps forgot."**

And deep down, beneath the wonder and the fear, you feel something you haven't felt in a long time — the sense that you are *exactly* where you're supposed to be. That every storm you've ever weathered was leading here.

The ship drifts forward on its own, as if the water itself knows the way.

And you — *you let it.*
