# The Dream Job Competition

As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and realize each one peels away a layer of what you *thought* you wanted, revealing something deeper underneath.

The first challenge seems straightforward: give a presentation to a panel of judges. But when you step up to the podium, you discover there's no podium at all—just a vast, empty stage that keeps expanding. Your notes dissolve in your hands like tissue paper in water. Yet somehow, words flow from you effortlessly, not the rehearsed speech you'd planned, but truths you didn't know you carried.

The second challenge takes place in a room with infinite doors. Behind one is your dream job. You open door after door: one reveals you at a desk drowning in golden light but unable to move; another shows you celebrated and applauded but completely alone; another displays a version of you that looks successful but whose eyes are empty.

Then you notice a door that's different—smaller, weathered, almost hidden. It doesn't gleam like the others. When you open it, you see yourself doing something you'd forgotten you loved, something you'd dismissed as "impractical" or "not impressive enough." But in this vision, your face is alive. You're surrounded by people. You're *present*.

The final challenge: the judge asks you what your dream job actually is.

And as you open your mouth to answer, you realize the competition itself has changed you. The prize you came for no longer exists—because *you* are no longer who you were when you arrived.
