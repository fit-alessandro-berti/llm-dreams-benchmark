embark on a journey to find a rumored safe haven, a place whispered about in the survivors' tales—a lush, hidden valley where clean water flows and food grows in abundance. You gather what little you have: a tattered backpack, a half-empty canteen, and a rusty knife you scavenged from an abandoned camp. The sky above is a dull gray, streaked with ash, and the wind carries the distant echoes of crumbling structures.
As you set out, you encounter a small group of fellow wanderers—three others, each as wary as you are. There’s Lila, a sharp-eyed woman with a makeshift bow slung over her shoulder; Marcus, a burly man clutching a dented metal pipe; and Tali, a quiet teenager who clutches a worn journal like it’s her lifeline. They’ve heard the same rumors you have, and after a tense standoff, you agree to travel together, strength in numbers outweighing the risks of betrayal.
The first leg of your journey takes you through a skeletal forest, trees stripped bare by years of neglect and toxic rain. You hear rustling in the underbrush and freeze—Lila notches an arrow, her breath steady. Out stumbles a gaunt figure, not a predator but a man, wild-eyed and desperate. He begs for food, but your supplies are already dwindling. Marcus steps forward, pipe raised, but you intervene, offering the stranger a few sips of water instead. He mutters something about “the valley” and points west before collapsing from exhaustion. You leave him with a scrap of cloth for shade, unsure if he’ll survive the night.
Days blur into weeks as you traverse cracked highways and dodge roving bands of scavengers. One night, under a rare glimpse of stars piercing the smog, Tali opens her journal and reads aloud a sketchy map her father left her—a path to the valley. It’s incomplete, but it aligns with the stranger’s gesture: west, past the shattered city, toward a jagged mountain range. Hope flickers in your chest, fragile but alive.
The dream shifts as you reach the city’s edge. Towering ruins loom like broken teeth against the horizon, and a storm brews overhead. Lightning reveals a silhouette—a massive, makeshift gate guarded by figures in ragged armor. They demand a toll: half your supplies or your weapons. Lila grips her bow tighter, Marcus shifts his weight, and Tali looks to you, wide-eyed. You realize the choice is yours—fight, barter, or flee—and the valley’s promise hangs in the balance.
What do you do?
