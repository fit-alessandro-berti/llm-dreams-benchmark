I'll continue this dream sequence:

I start to frantically check my pockets, only to find that instead of my phone, I pull out a compass that glows with an ethereal blue light. The compass needle doesn't point north - instead, it spins and points toward different buildings as if responding to my thoughts about the meeting.

I follow the compass through winding streets where the architecture seems to shift and morph when I'm not looking directly at it. The buildings stretch impossibly tall, their tops disappearing into cotton candy clouds that swirl in impossible patterns.

As I walk, I notice that my footsteps leave glowing ripples in the pavement, like stones dropped in a pond. Other people on the street don't seem to notice - they're all walking backwards while reading books that appear to be written in light.

The compass suddenly pulls strongly toward a building that looks like it's made entirely of stained glass and flowing water. I enter through a door that feels like walking through a warm summer breeze, only to find myself in a room where gravity seems optional, and business people in suits are floating around a conference table like astronauts, casually passing coffee cups that pour upward instead of down.

Someone waves to me from across the room - it's my own reflection in a mirror, but it's wearing different clothes and gesturing for me to hurry. I realize I'm right on time, even though all the clocks in the room are melting like Salvador Dalí paintings...
