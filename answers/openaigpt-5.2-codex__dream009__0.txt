…figure out how to survive and, if possible, how to get home.

At first everything is just color and noise: thatched roofs, a dirt path, the smell of smoke and livestock. You try to speak, but the words feel wrong in your mouth. A passing farmer squints at your clothes, then looks away as if you’re a ghost. You tuck your shirt in, smear your face with dust, and follow the cart tracks toward a cluster of huts. Hunger and the weight of not belonging settle in your stomach.

Days blur. You trade small tricks—tying stronger knots, showing how to boil water—for a place by a fire. A potter teaches you their language in exchange for a simple wheel you carve from scrap wood. Somewhere between waking and sleeping, you realize you’re no longer just passing through. You could change things. You could introduce a spark, a blade, a song.

One night, a star falls and lands in a field, humming like a modem. You chase it and find a piece of glass that glows with the blue light of your phone screen. When you touch it, the world stretches and bends like taffy. The villagers, the fires, the sky—all of it pulls into a single point.

You wake up in your own bed, heart racing, your hand still curled as if holding something that isn’t there. For a moment, you can still taste woodsmoke.
