The darkness swirls around you like a living fog, each step deeper into the maze sharpening the edges of your thoughts. The walls are shifting—some stretch like transparent glass, others crumble into shifting sand. The puzzles don’t just test logic; they challenge you to remember fragments of forgotten dreams, each one a hidden answer.

A voice whispers from nowhere, guiding you forward.  
**"Patience is the key."**

You press on, solving riddles etched into crumbling tiles, unraveling walls that whisper secrets only the wise can understand. With every revelation, the maze becomes less maddening, more like a cathedral of meaning.

Finally, you reach the center—a mirror filled with the reflections of your thoughts. In its depths, you see not just yourself, but all the paths you’ve taken. And from it, the maze begins to whisper:

**"You are the solution."**

The dreams fade—not with clarity, but with the weight of a truth you carry inward.
