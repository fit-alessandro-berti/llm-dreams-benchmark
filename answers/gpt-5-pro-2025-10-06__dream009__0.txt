…learn how to be from before.

You wake to the scrape of a wooden shutter and the sweet-acrid breath of smoke and damp straw. Something knocks against your foot—your bag—and you pat it like a talisman. No zipper hum. No cold rectangle of a phone. When your hand finds it, it is only a smooth river stone with a sheen like an old screen, reflecting your face as a smear of light.

Outside: a lane of rutted earth, plank doors latching with leather, geese muttering around a spilled basket of greens, a dog with burrs in its fur regarding you like a riddle. Above, timbers cross and sway, roofs stitched with thatch and moss. At the end of the lane, something like a bell rings not by electricity but by an arm and a rope. The sound carries across low fields and a gray river that moves as if it remembers other names.

The first person who meets your eyes is a woman carrying a bundle of sticks. She has ash on her cheek, and her hair is bound in a blue cloth that once was a dress. She looks at your clothes with a furrow that is not yet suspicion. She says a word. You don’t know it, but somehow you do. Or the dream obliges. You answer. Your voice works in a time that isn’t yours. You ask where you are, but it is the wrong question. She points to the sky and the bell and the bread hung to cool, and you understand: where is here.

As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to stop waiting for a siren or a ringtone to pull you back. There is no grid humming underneath this place. If you want a signal, you will have to make your own.

You inventory your pockets like a ship’s hold: a folded receipt with the words already bleeding into the fiber; a key that does not fit anything; a stick of gum softened into a crescent; two bandaids that will be gone the moment you need them. Nothing converts to bread. Nothing converts to time.

At the river someone has lashed a wheel to pilings, and it turns and then stalls, groaning. The men at the bank curse and poke and wade, their trousers darkening up to the knee. You know pulleys and leverage the way you know the layout of your apartment in the dark. You step into the water that takes your breath away and wedge a branch here, a wedge of river stone there, and the wheel catches again, the whole thing waking with a shudder. The men call to one another, astonished, then clap your back as if they’ve always known you. You learn the first true thing: utility is a kind of passport.

You learn to say yes to what your body already knew how to do: lift, knead, carry. You learn that soap here is not a bottle but a smell and a caustic slickness in a wooden trough, and that hands, just hands, can make a place kinder. When a child coughs until his ribs rattle, you do not have pills or beeping machines. You have boiled water and clean cloth and the sense that fear is contagious if you let it out. You have the idea of willow bark from a corner of your memory, and you brew something bitter and hope, and the child sleeps at last with his mouth open in a perfect O of trust. The mother crosses herself or perhaps she is drawing the shape of a wind on her chest; you do not ask which because it doesn’t matter. She presses bread into your hands, bread that is still singing from the oven.

You accumulate names the way the day accumulates corners of shadow. There is Tomas, whose mallet leaves a rhythm in the air. There is Elske, the girl who tucks a red thread into your sleeve “for luck,” she says, and it is the same shade as your old flat’s standby light. There is the old man who calls you a word that might be “wanderer” or “warning,” and laughs because, “wandering is a kind of telling, too.”

When the evenings come, people gather by the hearth that eats wood slowly and tells you what time it is by the way the smoke snakes. You tell them stories because language is technology, too. You tell of a tower that talks to the sky and the sky that answers in storms of light. You tell what it was to sit before a pane of glass and see a friend a thousand miles away, and they look at one another and decide whether this is a parable. “We used to do that,” says a woman with a scar like a comma. “With mirrors.” She smiles. “We have not forgotten everything.”

But while you can make yourself useful, something gnaws. It isn’t homesickness, exactly. It’s a line you once read about how, if you need to cross a river and there is no bridge, you become one. The thought returns like a migratory bird: if you cannot be pulled back, can you leave a way forward? You realize you need to plant something that will not rot or be burned for fuel. You need to write to the only person you can reliably reach: yourself.

You walk to the building site where stone is being stacked into intention. The church—or maybe it is a hall for grain—does not care what you name it; it intends to outlast everyone you know. You offer your back and your wrists to the work, and the mason accepts without questions because this is an economy of labor, not paperwork. All day you pass stones up like questions and they come down as answers in the wall. At dusk the mason gives you a shard of fired tile and a nail like a thin thorn.

That night by the light of a fat tallow candle, you scratch into the tile. Not your whole name—names change in a hundred years like riverbanks—but a mark only you would recognize even if you had forgotten yourself: the small constellation of three and then three, angled like a belt and then a sword. You draw the river as it kinks, and the hill where the bell rope answers the sky, and the tree that leans so far it should have fallen five winters ago but did not. You carve: “Under the second stair of the east door.” You hesitate—east depends on a sun that might go missing in your fear—and you add a second instruction for a world without a compass: “Where the shadow falls at noon on the longest day.”

You press your thumb into the wet soot on the candle cup and make your print in the corner, the whorl like a spiral galaxy truncated. The print looks both ridiculous and holy.

When no one watches, you slide the tile into the lift of stones as if you are tucking a letter into a sleeve. The wall takes it. The wall does not mind secrets; walls are made of them. The mason smears mortar like silence. You stay long enough to tamp down your panic with the thud of the mallet. Your hands learn their new map: palm, callus, crescent of dirt that won’t wash out.

Time in dreams is a book with torn pages, and you turn them without knowing it. It is harvest, and a festival, and the river is low enough to walk across without getting your hem wet. It is winter, and everyone’s breath makes the lane into a landscape of fog. Elske threads the red string into your hair now, because your hair is long, and says you look like saints in a picture. Someone dies and someone else is born and neither announces itself with fanfare, only change of a chair at the hearth and a wail that insists we are not done yet.

You are in the nave of the church two lifetimes later and also you are in a hard hat with a sticker peeling off it that says your name in block letters. Your colleagues are debating a layer of fill and whether to broaden the trench when the trowel clicks not against stone but against intent. You kneel. You brush. Dust rises that smells like the inside of someone else’s memory.

A shard of tile emerges. On it, soot preserved like a fossil of night. Three and then three. A kink in a river. Your own thumbprint reaching back to lay its whorl over yours. For a moment the world is a perfect hinge.

Your heart does not thunder like a charge but like footsteps on the other side of a door. There is laughter nearby that belongs to the people you ate with and also to your team, who do not yet know what they have found. Detached, you hear someone—yourself in the hard hat—say a series of practical things about documentation. “Photograph, record, bag.” Your own voice wears the cadence of authority you once wished for and did not know how to bear.

In the dream you are allowed to be both the burier and the one who digs. You are allowed to be the bridge and the river. For a moment you are a sentence written across centuries, and you make sense.

You sit back on your heels. The tile in your palm warms the way a living thing does. Someone touches your shoulder like the bell rope tugged at last, and the sound inside you rings and rings. You look up through a timeline of scaffolds and rafters and roofs that no longer exist, through dust motes that are also stars, and you think: so that was what I needed—to become my own message, to be useful where I fell, to believe the future could find me if I left it something to hold.

The dream closes on the same lane. The dog is older, or it is another dog with the same tired wisdom. The river carries a boat made of reeds, and on it lies a bundle that could be a baby or a loaf or your old life. You do not reach for it. You stand and turn toward the bell. You have work in both directions, and your hands know the way.
