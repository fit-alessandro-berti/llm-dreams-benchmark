... find a way to contact my friends. Where was I? I couldn't say. Cobblestone streets stretched before me, horses pulling carts down narrow lanes, the air thick with the scent of woodsmoke and something deliciously sweet...cinnamon? ...and then, a sharp, metallic scent, cold and heavy...something that brought back a visceral memory of the blacksmith's forge back in that one history museum exhibit: Steel.  

Memories of my childhood fascination with the blacksmith's scorching breath on the metal, the rhythmic clang of hammer against iron, filled me with a strange, nostalgic anxiety. I hastily looked around, heart pounding. This wasn't the museum. I didn't even recognize the language on the signs hanging outside the buildings. Raw, clumsy, wooden carts jostled by in the street, and people in roughspun clothing hawked wares I'd never dreamed of: spun wool, medicinal herbs, blacksmith-forged tools.

It was a cobbled-together image, like a poorly reconstructed palimpsest. A blacksmith's cough reverberated between the buildings, the rasp echoing through the centuries. Pulling me out of my daze, a little girl with eyes as bright as the ribbons in her braided hair, clutched at my pant leg, a worried frown creasing her brow. 

"Papa merci, petite dame?" she asked, tugging on my trousers.

I looked down at the girl, my mind reeling. "Merci?" I repeated, confused by the unfamiliar word.

A frown wrinkled across the little girl's face. I suddenly recollection: Her eyes were wide with fear. I'd seen that look before.

"Papa Ethan, I'm cold!" she complained, her voice small and trembling.

That's when it hit him. "Papa?"

The girl's frown deepened, as if I'd just offended her. "They call you Ethan?!" she exclaimed, "I could've sworn they said they wouldn't let you remember until I was older...they," her voice caught again, "they said there was no need to know them. The doctor, the blacksmith..."

She wanted more, needed more. My past self, the man this little girl thought I was, wanted more.

"I forgot their names, their faces," Ethan lamented, his voice strained. "I can just feel it, like a pain in the back of my mind, that a secret map of the world of menus is not designated for me."


From here, I could:

1. **Embrace the Deception:** Continue to play along with the little girl, "helping" her remember her salvaged vocabulary of culinary vocabulary from our shared past life, live in the moment, and learn to navigate this new reality.
 
2. **Reject the Game:** End her speech, the little girl's dismay. So the dream morphed into something different, something distant. Instead of the past, a blurry image began to appear.

"But I'm trying to remember **what** I've got," the girl continues, her voice small but firm, "Because **the Bakery**, they said, **it all starts with the cake.**"

This sentence echoed in the air, catching my attention, pulling me from my hazy amusement at my confusion to the wave of shocking clarity that washed over me. This 'past' wasn't what we know, not the kitchens of a bygone era... this was about her being wrong, and I, no, 'Papa', was in this world. **The season starts with figs.**

The option to reject the hall of mirrors of my past flashed before my eyes, but how can you reject your own life? The girl, with a name she couldn't remember, was right. We must dig deeper into this...

Let me know if you're ready to explore what happens next in the dream.  Which option would you like to see?
