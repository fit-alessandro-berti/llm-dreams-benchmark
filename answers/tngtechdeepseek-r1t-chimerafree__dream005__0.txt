**Dream Completion:**  

As you weave through the bustling crowd, the air hums with laughter and fragmented conversations, yet you feel oddly detached. The first group you approach—a circle of elegantly dressed strangers—turns toward you in unison, their smiles too wide, eyes glinting with an intensity that makes your chest tighten. They beckon you closer, but their words dissolve into static as you mutter an excuse and slip away.  

Next, a cluster of people huddled around a flickering firepit catches your eye. Their faces glow warmly, and one offers you a drink. For a moment, you feel at ease—until you notice their features shifting subtly, like melting wax. You step back, disoriented, as their voices warp into echoes.  

The crowd thickens, bodies pressing in until the room feels labyrinthine. You catch fleeting glimpses of the person you’re seeking—a familiar laugh, a flash of their coat—but they vanish each time you draw near. Panic rises as the walls begin to pulse, the ceiling dripping like wet paint.  

Finally, you spot them across the room, their back turned. Relief floods you as you push forward, but when they face you, their expression is hollow, their eyes voids. You reach out, only for them to crumble into ash.  

You wake with a gasp, the dream’s residue clinging to you: a haunting blend of longing and the uncanny, as if your subconscious whispered, *Connection is just beyond your grasp.*
