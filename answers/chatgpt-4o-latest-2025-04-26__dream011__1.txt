written in a language you don't recognize — looping symbols and shifting letters that seem alive on the page. You blink and rub your eyes, but the symbols keep moving, forming puzzles instead of questions. A soft hum fills the air, and when you look up, you realize the other students are not people at all, but shimmering outlines, like sketches half-erased.

Panic starts to rise, but then your desk gently floats upward, lifting you into a vast open sky above the exam hall. Below, the floor is a patchwork of memories — childhood drawings, forgotten conversations, missed chances — all stitched together like a quilt. A voice you can’t see whispers: *“Remember, you already know the answers.”*

You glance back at the exam, and the shifting symbols have stopped. Now they are mirrors, reflecting scenes of you succeeding, failing, trying again. Each answer you write doesn't come from knowledge, but from feeling — a deep certainty, like recalling a dream you hadn't realized you were having.

As you finish, the paper folds itself into a small bird and flies from your hands, soaring into the endless blue.

Would you like me to continue this dream even further? 🌙
