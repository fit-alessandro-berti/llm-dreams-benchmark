...panic, but then a strange calm washes over you. The city around you begins to shift. The skyscrapers, which were a chaotic jumble of steel and glass, start to subtly realign, their windows catching the light in a way that forms a shimmering, golden path in the air, like a ribbon of sunlight. It’s pointing down a specific avenue.

You don't question it. It feels as natural as knowing your own name in a dream. You follow the path. The sounds of the city—the honking cars, the distant sirens, the chatter of the crowd—morph into a rhythmic, melodic hum, a soundtrack to your journey. The faces of the people you pass are blurry and indistinct, but they all seem to nod in encouragement as you go by.

The golden path leads you to a building that wasn't there a moment before. It’s an old, ornate library squeezed between two modern banks. The heavy oak door swings open without you touching it. Inside, it’s impossibly vast, with bookshelves stretching up into a starry sky instead of a ceiling. You know, with absolute certainty, that your meeting is here.

A small, white cat with eyes like opals brushes against your legs, then trots ahead, leading you through the labyrinth of shelves. You arrive at a circular clearing with a single, simple table and two chairs. Sitting in one chair is a version of yourself, smiling warmly.

"Ah, you made it," your dream-self says. "We have a lot to discuss."
