...begin to notice something unsettling: the walls themselves are breathing.

Not metaphorically. The stone exhales in long, slow rhythms, and each breath nudges the corridors — just slightly — so that the map you've been mentally constructing keeps *shifting at the edges*. You pull out a piece of chalk and mark an X on the wall beside you, and within thirty seconds the X slides three inches to the left, as though the maze is politely but firmly disagreeing with your attempt to anchor yourself.

The first puzzle was simple enough — a panel of colored tiles you had to press in a sequence that mirrored the Fibonacci pattern. The second required you to reroute water through a series of copper pipes so that the pressure balanced perfectly on both sides of a scale. Satisfying. Clean. The kind of problem that has a bottom.

But now, deeper in, the puzzles have started to *bleed into each other*.

There's a chess problem carved into a stone table, but the pieces are also words, and moving the knight changes a sentence on the wall behind you, which changes the water level in a pool ahead, which reflects light onto a mirror, which illuminates a new section of the tile floor — and suddenly you understand that **every puzzle has been one puzzle**.

You stand very still.

The maze is not a collection of challenges.

The maze is an *argument*. A single, enormous logical proposition that you've been walking through from the inside, solving clauses with your feet, with your hands, with your choices about which corridor to take. You realize with a lurch of vertigo that turning left twenty minutes ago was a *premise*. You committed to it. The whole structure downstream of that moment assumes it to be true.

You backtrack mentally — you can't physically backtrack, the corridors have sealed themselves with the gentle finality of an exhalation — and you stress-test the premise. Was it sound? You think of the tiles, the pipes, the chess pieces. Yes. It holds. The argument is valid so far, but validity isn't truth, and you still don't know what the maze is *trying to prove*.

Then you reach a room with no puzzles at all.

Just a mirror.

And in the mirror you don't look like yourself — or rather, you look like a version of yourself that has been here much longer. The reflection has chalk dust on its hands and a particular expression you recognize: the one that appears on your face in waking life when you've been working on a problem so long that you've stopped being a person and become a function. Input, process, output. The reflection looks efficient and a little hollow.

It raises one hand — *before you raise yours* — and points to a door to your left that you somehow didn't see until this moment.

You understand that this is the last puzzle.

Not a riddle. Not a sequence or a balance or a pattern. The question the maze has been building toward, through every corridor and every clicking mechanism, is simply:

**Do you trust what you see, or what you know?**

Your reflection is pointing left. Your chalk marks — the ones that slid but never disappeared — form a trail that curves right.

You notice your hand is already raised, reaching toward the door on the left, mirror-logic pulling at you.

You stop.

You think about the breathing walls, about premises, about the difference between a maze that wants to be solved and a maze that wants to *teach you something about how you solve*. You think about how every puzzle in this place rewarded the second look, the assumption questioned, the variable you forgot to account for.

The reflection's expression doesn't change. It is very patient. It has been here longer than you.

You turn right.

The corridor opens into a vast underground garden — impossible, lit by bioluminescent moss — and at the center is a simple wooden table with two chairs and a cup of tea that is still steaming, as though someone just set it down and stepped away.

On the table is a note.

It says: *Not because the mirror was lying. Because you remembered that you are not a reflection of yourself.*

*The maze is complete. You may wake up now.*

And you almost do — you feel the dream thinning at the edges the way dreams do, reality pressing its cold nose against the glass —

but first you sit down, and you drink the tea, and it tastes exactly like the color of the bioluminescent moss looks, which is to say it tastes like a question you're glad you asked.

Then you wake up.

And for just a moment, before the morning reassembles itself around you, you are absolutely certain that the answer you found in the maze is still in your hands — warm, specific, true — even if you can't quite remember the shape of the question.
