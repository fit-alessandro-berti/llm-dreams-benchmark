...barter for shelter before the heavy city gates slam shut for the night. The problem is, you have no coin—only the strange, synthetic clothes on your back and a digital wristwatch that glows faintly in the twilight.

As you hesitate in the bustling cobblestone square, a hooded merchant catches sight of the illuminated face of your watch. His eyes widen, not with curiosity, but with superstitious fear. He whispers something in a dialect you barely recognize, pointing a trembling finger at your "sorcerous device." You realize quickly that you need to hide your technology before the town guard notices, because in this era, being different isn't just a social awkwardness—it's a crime punishable by the dungeon. You pull your sleeve down, duck into a narrow alleyway, and pray you can remember enough history to navigate this night alive.
