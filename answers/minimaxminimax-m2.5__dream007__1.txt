You decide to **speak the unspoken**—to finally say the thing that has been hovering at the edge of your thoughts like a half‑remembered song. The words rise from somewhere deep inside you, trembling at first, then gaining strength as they leave your lips. You tell your friend that the real issue isn’t the debate itself, but the fear that you’ve been drifting apart, that the distance you both feel is slowly turning into a chasm neither of you knows how to cross.

Your friend’s eyes widen, the fire in their gaze softening into something raw and vulnerable. For a heartbeat the air between you seems to shimmer, as if the dream itself is holding its breath. The hallway behind you morphs into a vast, twilight‑colored garden, each flower glowing faintly with the hue of a memory: the late‑night talks, the shared jokes, the promises you made when you were younger and less afraid.

As you speak, the argument doesn’t disappear—it transforms. The words you’ve hurled at each other become the wind that stirs the petals, the thunder that rumbles softly in the distance. You realize that the disagreement was a mask, a way to avoid the more terrifying truth that you both needed to be heard, not just to win. 

The friend steps closer, and the garden’s vinescurl gently around your ankles, as if anchoring you both to this moment. “I’m scared too,” they whisper, and the words fall like dew onto the leaves. The dream shifts again; the garden fades into a soft, golden light, and you feel a warmth spread through your chest—not the heat of anger, but the comforting glow of understanding.

You both stand there, bathed in that luminous glow, the argument now a distant echo. The dream invites you to hold onto this feeling, to carry it with you when you wake. As you do, the world around you begins to dissolve into a gentle mist, and you hear a distant chime, like a door opening somewhere far away, inviting you to step through and continue the conversation in the waking world. 

And just before the dream slips entirely away, you feel your friend’s hand reach for yours—steady, warm, and ready to walk forward together, no longer as adversaries, but as companions ready to face whatever comes next.
