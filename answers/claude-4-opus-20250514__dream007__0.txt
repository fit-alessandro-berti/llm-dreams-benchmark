...walk away and climb the spiral staircase that suddenly appears beside us, winding impossibly high into clouds that smell like cinnamon. Each step I take changes color beneath my feet - blue to gold to deep purple. My friend's voice follows me up, but it's transforming into wind chimes.

At the top, I find myself in a glass room suspended in nothing, where all our past conversations are floating as soap bubbles. I reach out to touch one - the time we laughed until we cried at 3am - and it pops, releasing the sound of that laughter. 

My friend is suddenly there too, but we're both children now, sitting cross-legged on the glass floor. Between us, the thing we were arguing about has become a small origami crane that unfolds itself over and over, revealing different words each time: \,\ at each other and realize we can't remember what we were fighting about. The crane becomes a door, and through it, we can see our future selves having coffee together, gray-haired and still talking. The argument dissolves like sugar in rain.

I wake up with the taste of cinnamon still on my tongue and text my friend: \ to get coffee?\
