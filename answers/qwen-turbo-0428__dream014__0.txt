You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you feel a warmth spread through you, like the first light of dawn after a long night. They speak with gentle voices, their eyes full of empathy, and they don’t just give you directions — they share stories of their own journeys, of times they too felt lost, and how they found their way back.

One of them, a woman with silver hair and a warm smile, hands you a small, folded map she says was once her grandmother’s. “It always leads people home,” she says, and when you unfold it, the streets shift and rearrange, as if guided by something unseen. The others walk with you, not just to show the way, but to remind you that you are not alone.

As you walk, the city seems to change around you — the noise becomes softer, the lights more golden, and the people seem kinder, as if the dream itself is responding to the kindness you’re experiencing. You realize that this isn’t just about finding your way through the city — it’s about finding your way back to yourself.

And then, as you reach a familiar place — a park, a café, a quiet street you’ve never seen but somehow know — the strangers stop, smile, and fade into the mist, leaving you with a sense of peace and purpose. You turn around, and for the first time in a long while, you feel ready to keep going.
