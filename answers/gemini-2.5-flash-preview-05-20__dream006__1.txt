You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to...

...feel your throat tighten, your prepared words dissolving into a jumbled mess in your mind. You open your mouth, ready to push through, but instead of sound, a single, perfectly formed rose petal flutters out. Then another. And another.

They are vibrant, impossibly delicate, in shades of deep crimson, soft pink, and creamy white. They drift silently from your lips, catching the stage lights as they fall. A ripple of murmurs goes through the crowd, not of confusion or mockery, but of quiet anticipation, as if this is exactly what they had come to see.

You try to force words, but the petals keep coming, a soft, silent cascade from your mouth. They begin to pile up around your feet, a growing mound of fragrant beauty. Panic should surge, but it doesn't. Instead, there's a strange, profound sense of peace. The stage lights soften, bathing everything in a warm, golden glow. The air fills with the sweet, damp scent of a summer garden after rain.

The audience seems to lean forward, their faces no longer distinct, but a blur of serene contentment. You look down at your hands, and instead of skin, delicate green stems are beginning to unfurl, tiny buds forming on your fingertips. A whisper of a breeze, smelling of damp earth and honey, sweeps across the stage. You are no longer a speaker, but a silent, breathing part of something ancient and growing, your body becoming light, root-bound, and utterly calm. The last thing you see before the image dissolves is a single, large, dewy petal unfolding over your eyes, plunging you into soft, fragrant darkness.
