 …they’re breathing. Not in the mechanical rise-and-fall of lungs, but in the slow, tidal rhythm of continents drifting apart and colliding again. You lean closer—too close—and the swirls of bronze and midnight blue shift under your gaze, rearranging themselves into constellations you almost recognize from a childhood summer you never actually had.

Your fingertip hovers above the surface. When you finally press down, the metal isn’t cold. It’s warm, feverish, and yields slightly like skin over a pulse. The patterns flare, luminescent, tracing pathways that map the inside of your own skull—the whorls of your fingerprints reflected back at you, but older, as if they’ve been waiting since before you were born.

You realize then that the box isn’t locked because something is being kept out.

It’s locked because something is being kept *in*.

And it’s knocking.

Three raps, precise and patient, vibrating up through your palms. With each knock, the room around you loosens at the seams. The walls become translucent, then gauzy, then gone entirely, replaced by a vast grey beach where the tide is made of clock gears grinding against one another. The sky is a mirror; you see yourself looking down at yourself looking down, an infinite regression that makes your teeth ache with déjà vu.

The patterns on the box begin to peel away like burning film, revealing not wood or iron beneath, but a door. Your door. The one from the apartment you lived in when you were seven, the blue paint chipped by the cat you’ve never owned but somehow miss with a visceral, bone-deep sorrow.

You don’t have a key, but you have a memory.

You press your palm against the knob—brass, sticky with humidity from that impossible summer—and turn.

The box opens inward, folding itself into dimensions that hurt to observe, and inside, nestled on velvet the color of forgotten lullabies, is a second box. Smaller. More intricate. The patterns on this one are moving faster now, desperate, spelling out words in a language you’re forgetting even as you read it.

You understand, with the liquid logic of dreams, that you will spend eternity opening boxes within boxes, each one closer to the center of a labyrinth that is also your own heart. And somewhere, in the smallest box of all—so tiny it fits between your atoms—you can hear the ocean, and someone laughing, and the sound of a key turning in a lock that was never there to begin with.

You reach inside.

The tide comes in.

You wake up with the taste of brass on your tongue, your hands curled as if around something that has already vanished.
