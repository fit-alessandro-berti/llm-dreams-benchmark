...clinch my hands tighter on the helm, the wood slick and cold beneath my clammy grip.  The wind screams like a banshee, whipping the sea into a frenzy. Waves, mountains of angry water, crash over the bow, stinging the faces of my crew with icy spray. Fear clings to them like the barnacles that encrust our hull; I can see it in the way their eyes dart nervously to the storm-tossed sails, the groaning of the ship's timbers echoing across their worried faces.

I don't blame them. This storm, it came on like a thief, stealing the tranquility of the voyage with sudden, snapping winds and a sky jealous with churning black clouds. The ship, the "Siren's Song," pitches and rolls violently beneath me, each lurch a reminder that I must make a decision soon.

"Captain! What are your orders?" bellowed the First Mate, his voice barely audible over the deafening roar of the storm. He clung to the rail, weathering the waves that now seemed to want to devour us whole.

I scanned the turbulent horizon, the commanding presence I usually tried to project powerless against the relentless fury of the storm.  

"We hold our course, William!" I yelled back, tightening my grip on the wheel. 

William, ever loyal but doubting my sanity, shot me a dubious look. "But Captain, the waves are too high for—"

I cut him off, feeling the wind threaten to tear the sails, "For," I emphasized, "for what? For questions?" A shiver, whether from the cold or the fear clinging to us, I couldn't tell. "These are storms we must ride through, not run from! We need to see this through."

He hesitated, then nodded, his face pale but determined. I knew my captain's gaze, sharp and unwavering. I had inherited a fire from him, a fierce, albeit stubborn, spark. Still, my hands feel cold and clammy from the frigid water lashing against my face as I write.

"Do we chart a course to take us to haven, for expediency? Or…" I squinted at the churning sea, “...do… we… sail… directly… into… its teeth."

Initially Charles and I argued for a safe route to shore, but now, I confess, I see reason in the psychology of th—" 

The ship lurched violently, salt water erupting over the deck in a roar, soaking me through. I (whoever I am in this dream) could almost hear the fear smashing against the hull with the waves. 

"No, Jonas (I hear the re-trim stake cracking, the deck tilting perilously - but I'm pretty sure I still know what I'm doing!). 

I braced myself, watching as the "Siren's Song" plunged forward, riding a monstrous wave that seemed to rise up like a wall of seawater.

The storm raged on, the sky a dark and angry canvas. I braced myself,

just as the "Siren's Song" was battered by a monstrous wave, a green slap of churning water that threatened to rip us from the deck. I held on to the railing, my knuckles white, as the timbers groaned and the waves crashed over the hull. This is it," I'd say.  "We aren't making it to shore the easy way. Load the port cannons!"

The "haven" was a shadow I wanted to flee to, my captain, the grandly dressed and bejewelled man who was clearly not a man of action, called to us, his voice almost drowned by the storm.

"Jonas?" he said. "The ship…the tempestuous ocean…" My knuckles tighten further.

"Aye, Captain," I yelled, turning the crimson tide of the salt spray to walk through the depths
of this storm, battling the waves with... a desperate hope that somehow you were literally just the First Mate to speak of sloshing to the water's creatures, the subtle dingoes within the incredible complexity of this ship,

The ship, battered but defiant, continued its voyage, launching itself time and again against the battered
port.

Now the ship is caught in a tempestuous, treacherous situation.

It doesn't continue for me, that's the end of the dream! Do you think it's good to keep going? Do you want to continue this story?"
