completely different from anything you studied or expected. Instead of technical jargon related to your field of study, they're filled with riddles, puzzles, and cryptic poems. You furrow your brows in confusion. 

The first question reads: "In shadows I dwell, yet consume nothing. I give light where there is darkness. Who am I?"

You scratch your head, not entirely sure how to answer this using the knowledge you've gained from hours of studying algorithms and data structures. You take a deep breath, trying to calm the nervous flutters in your stomach. 

The person next to you chuckles softly, already scribbling away with a wistful smile on their face. They finish the riddle in seconds: "Candle," they write. You watch them move on to the next question, feeling increasingly out of your depth. 

Then, you remember an ancient mythology class you took for fun during undergrad - perhaps it's time to draw on that unexpected knowledge? You hope the proctor won't notice as you start translating cryptic texts into modern answers, hoping for the best in this bizarre dream-exam.
