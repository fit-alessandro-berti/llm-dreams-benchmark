as you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people—laughter bubbling over, guitar strings humming, conversations stretching into poetry. But no where do you see the other person. It’s like looking for a song on a radio with static where the melody just out of reach.  

Then, halfway through this search, a beat catches your ear—sharp, unexpected, like a note cut from the silence. You turn, and there they are, clinging to a bamboo staff, serenading a crowd of faces—among them, yours.  

They look at you, and the static fades. You’re offered a hand, and when you reach out, the connection feels like time slowing. Everyone else in the room holds their breath, then laughs—soft, approving.  

With a single glance, understanding passes between you. No words needed. You walk toward them, the glow of new connection warming the foundry of strangers around you. The gathering fades as suddenly as it came, but something inside feels whole—and a little magical.  

And somewhere, in the hum of the crowd, you hear a voice ask:  
“Are you really here?”
