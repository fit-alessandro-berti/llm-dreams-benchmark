...realize that they are all speaking in a language that sounds like music, a melodic humming that vibrates in my chest rather than entering my ears. I push past a group of people wearing masks that look like my own face, their eyes following me as I move. 

The room seems to stretch; the floor tilts slightly, turning the simple act of walking into an uphill climb. I see a cluster of people passing around a large, glowing moon-like sphere, but when I look closer, the sphere is actually a giant, ticking pocket watch. 

I finally spot the person I know standing near a wall that is dissolving into water. I try to call out their name, but my voice catches in my throat, turning into a handful of dry autumn leaves that spill from my mouth. Before I can reach them, the crowd swells like a tide, sweeping me backward, and the person I know turns to look at me, their face blurring into a soft, radiant light just as the scene fades into the sensation of falling.
