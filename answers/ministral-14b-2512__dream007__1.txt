**Dream Continuation:**

The air between you and your friend crackles with tension, thick enough to taste—like the metallic tang of rain before a storm. You’ve said things you can’t unsay, and now the silence that follows is worse than the shouting. Your friend’s eyes, usually warm and familiar, are sharp as flint, reflecting something you don’t recognize: hurt, betrayal, or maybe even anger you didn’t know they were capable of.

You take a breath, your fingers curling into fists at your sides. The argument isn’t just about the *thing*—it’s about the way they looked at you when you brought it up, like you’d just stepped on something sacred. You want to explain, to make them understand, but the words twist in your throat. Instead, you reach out, your hand hovering between you like a bridge that might collapse.

Then—

A voice, not yours, whispers in your ear: *"What if you’re wrong?"*

The words hit like a splash of cold water. You freeze. Not because you’re afraid of the answer, but because you *don’t know*. The certainty you had moments ago—your righteousness, your conviction—suddenly feels like a house of cards. What if the argument isn’t about who’s right? What if it’s about something deeper, something you’ve both been avoiding?

Your friend’s voice cuts through the haze: *"You’re not listening."* Their tone isn’t accusatory—it’s exhausted. *"We’ve been dancing around this for years. Why now?"*

And just like that, the dream shifts. The room softens, the edges blurring. You’re no longer in the argument. You’re standing on a cliff at dusk, the wind tugging at your sleeves. Your friend is beside you, their shoulders tense but not turned away. The sun dips below the horizon, painting the sky in streaks of gold and violet.

*"Maybe we were both too scared to say it,"* they murmur.

You nod, because you *know*. The argument wasn’t about the *what*—it was about the *how*. The way you both loved the same thing but never dared to ask for it the same way. The dream unfolds like a secret you’ve been holding for years: not a fight to win, but a truth to uncover.

And then—you wake up.

But for the first time, the dream lingers. Not as a fight, but as a question.
