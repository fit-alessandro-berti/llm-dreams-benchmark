# The Dream Competition

...face various challenges and with each one, the rules seem to shift in impossible ways.

The first challenge appears simple: give a presentation about yourself. But as you step onto the stage, you realize the audience is made up of every version of yourself from different ages—yourself at 7, at 15, at 80. They all ask questions simultaneously, and somehow you need to give an answer that satisfies all of them at once.

You succeed, though you can't remember how.

The second challenge takes place in a building that shouldn't exist—floors that loop back on themselves, doors that open to rooms you've already left. You're told to find "what you've been missing," but the harder you search, the more the rooms multiply. Finally, you stop searching and simply sit down. That's when a door appears that wasn't there before, and behind it is a childhood toy you'd completely forgotten about. Everyone claps. You've passed.

The final challenge is the strangest: you're in a vast library, and you must write the perfect résumé. But every time you write something down, the ink rearranges itself into truths you haven't admitted to yourself. Your accomplishments become your fears. Your skills become your regrets. 

You realize, with that sudden clarity unique to dreams, that the competition was never about winning a job. Each challenge has been stripping away the performance, the persona, the polished version of yourself.

When you finally submit a blank page, you wake up—

—or do you? The interviewer smiles and shakes your hand. "You start Monday."
