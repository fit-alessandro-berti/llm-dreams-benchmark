a large paintbrush that seems to be floating in mid-air. The smell of vibrant hues fills your nostrils as you see various forms dancing on the canvas before you. There's a swirling vortex of blues and purples forming waves crashing against the edge of the image, and on its other side, majestic sunflowers shoot their tall stalks upwards towards the sky. You feel drawn to creating something in this world, as every color reminds you of your grandmother who taught you to paint with watercolors when you were just a child. Without further hesitation, you dip the brush into the canvas and begin painting - it's only you now that is changing this dreamscape one stroke at a time
