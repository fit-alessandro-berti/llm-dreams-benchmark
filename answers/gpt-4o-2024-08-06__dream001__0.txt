walk through the bustling streets, each one a maze of towering skyscrapers and glowing signs in languages you don’t recognize. The city is both fascinating and overwhelming, with a cacophony of unfamiliar sounds and faces that seem to blur together. You clutch a small slip of paper that contains the details of your meeting, but the addresses and landmarks mean nothing to you.

As you move through the streets, you notice something peculiar: the buildings seem to shift and change around you, subtly rearranging themselves like pieces of a puzzle. You pass by a café where time appears to slow, with patrons sipping coffee while suspended in mid-conversation, and a park where the trees sway to music only they can hear.

Desperate to find your way, you ask for directions from a passerby, who hands you a strange, glowing compass. The needle spins wildly before settling on a direction that feels oddly familiar. You decide to trust it, navigating the ever-changing streets with newfound confidence.

As you hurry past an array of fantastical storefronts and curiously curious creatures, you find yourself on a wide avenue lined with statues that seem to come alive with each step you take. The compass pulls you toward a grand building at the end of the street, its doors adorned with intricate carvings that shimmer like stardust.

Inside, an opulent yet serene lobby greets you. The air is filled with the scent of jasmine and whispers of ancient songs. A tall figure, cloaked in shadows, approaches and gestures for you to follow. Guided down a series of corridors that twist and turn like a labyrinth, you finally arrive at a large door that opens silently at your touch.

Within, a room filled with warm light and familiar faces awaits. You realize the meeting is with people dear to you, from different chapters of your life. They smile and motion for you to join them at the table, where a seat has been saved just for you.

In this moment, the anxiety of the morning's journey melts away, replaced by a sense of belonging and purpose. As the conversation begins, you understand that this meeting was not a chance occurrence but a pivotal moment in your ever-ongoing journey, reminding you of who you are and where you’ve been, guiding you toward what comes next.

Suddenly, you awaken, the dream still vivid in your mind, carrying with it the warmth and reassurance of those who welcomed you at the end of the impossible city.
