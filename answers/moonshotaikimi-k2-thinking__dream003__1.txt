...they begin to *breathe*. Not metaphorically—the carved grooves in the wood are actually rising and falling, as though the box itself has lungs. You pull your hand away, but your fingertips tingle where you touched it, and now you can see your own pulse glowing faintly beneath your skin, syncing with the rhythm of the patterns.

A low hum emanates from within, not through the air but through your bones. The box is *singing* to something inside you. The patterns rearrange themselves like sliding puzzle pieces, forming a constellation you recognize—not from any sky you've seen, but from a recurring dream you had as a child. The one where you fell upward into a starless dark.

You realize there *is* a key. It's been growing in your palm this whole time, a crystalline thing made from frozen breath and the memory of your mother's lullabies. When you try to close your fist around it, it melts, flows between your fingers, and re-forms on the box's surface—not as a key, but as a mirror.

In the reflection, you're not holding a box at all. You're holding a tiny, perfect house. And inside that house, someone who looks like you (but isn't) is examining a mysterious locked box with intricate patterns that are breathing, breathing, breathing...

The humming intensifies. The box begins to crack along its pattern-lines, but not breaking—*unfolding*. Like a flower, or a hand, or a secret you've been keeping from yourself.
