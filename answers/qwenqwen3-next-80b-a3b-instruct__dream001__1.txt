You start to walk—and the city shifts around you.

The streets are paved with liquid silver that ripples with every step, reflecting not your face, but memories you’ve forgotten: your mother singing off-key in the kitchen, the scent of rain on childhood pavement, the look in your dog’s eyes the day he left. Signs hang in midair, written in languages you somehow understand, yet each one contradicts the next:  
*“Meeting at the top of silence.”*  
*“You’re already late.”*  
*“The clock is breathing.”*

People pass you—some with no faces, others wearing masks made of clocks. One whispers, “The meeting is inside your heartbeat,” before dissolving into a flock of paper cranes.

You check your wrist. No watch. Just a tattoo of a compass, its needle spinning wildly—not pointing north, but toward your chest.

Panic claws at your throat. You run, but your feet barely touch the ground. The sky above is a mosaic of stained-glass windows, each glowing with a different version of your life: the one where you said yes, the one where you left, the one where you never woke up.

Then—silence.

A single door appears ahead, floating above a staircase made of stacked books. Each spine reads: *Your Last Promise.*

You climb. The air grows thick with the scent of old ink and ozone.

At the top, the door opens before you touch it.

Inside: an empty room, a single chair. A voice—yours, but older, calmer—says:

*“You were never late. You were always just afraid to sit down.”*

And then, as the chair vanishes beneath you, the dream doesn’t end.

It *unfolds.*

You open your eyes.

Your alarm is blaring.

It’s 7:00 a.m.

And on your nightstand, a single paper crane, folded in perfect silence, rests beside your phone.

It has your name written on its wing.

—And you suddenly remember:  
The meeting was with yourself.  
You were supposed to finally listen.
