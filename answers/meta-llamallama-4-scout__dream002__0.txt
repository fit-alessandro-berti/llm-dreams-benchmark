...the sky darkens to a deep, foreboding grey. The air grows thick with electricity, and I can smell the sweet, ozone scent of an impending thunderstorm. The trees around me begin to sway in the strengthening wind, their leaves rustling loudly as the gusts pick up. I quicken my pace, feeling a sense of unease creeping over me.

As I walk, the storm intensifies. The wind howls and the trees creak and groan, their branches swaying ominously. I hear the distant rumble of thunder, a low, menacing growl that seems to be getting closer and closer. The rain starts to fall, at first in gentle, fat drops, but quickly growing heavier and more insistent.

I look around, searching for shelter, but there's none in sight. The forest seems to stretch on forever, with no buildings or clearings in sight. I'm alone, and I feel a shiver run down my spine as the storm rages on.

Suddenly, a brilliant flash of lightning illuminates the forest, casting eerie shadows on the trees. The thunder booms and cracks, making me jump. I start to run, my feet pounding against the wet earth as I try to find some kind of refuge.

As I run, the forest around me begins to change. The trees seem to grow taller and more twisted, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. The wind and rain batter me, making it hard to see and breathe. I stumble, almost falling, and then...

...I see a faint light up ahead. It's a small, glowing cottage, nestled among the trees. Smoke drifts lazily from the chimney, and I can hear the sound of someone humming a gentle tune coming from inside. I burst through the door, slamming it shut behind me just as a loud crack of thunder splits the air.

I'm standing in a cozy, warm room, surrounded by soft candlelight and the comforting scent of baking. A kindly old woman looks up from her chair by the fire, a warm smile on her face.

"Welcome, traveler," she says. "Come in out of the storm. You're safe here."

As I catch my breath and warm up by the fire, I realize that the old woman is someone I know, but can't quite place. She's a friend from my childhood, or maybe a character from a favorite book. I'm not sure, but I feel a deep sense of comfort and familiarity in her presence.

The storm rages on outside, but inside, all is calm and peaceful. The old woman offers me a cup of tea, and as I sip it, I feel my worries and fears melting away. I'm safe, and I'm home. But as I look around the cottage, I start to notice strange things...
