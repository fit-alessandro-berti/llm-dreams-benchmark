You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel the weight of their gaze like a physical force. The clock above the desk ticks louder than usual, each second reverberating like a drumbeat in your skull. Your computer screen flickers to life, displaying a document filled with gibberish—paragraphs of shifting symbols and upside-down numbers that dissolve when you try to focus. 

Your boss leans closer, their face blurred at the edges, their voice a distorted growl. “You’ll stay until it’s done,” they say, though their lips don’t sync to the words. The walls of the office begin to warp, cubicles stretching into infinity, the ceiling sagging like wet cardboard. You grasp your keyboard, but the keys melt under your fingertips, pooling into a silver liquid that drips onto your lap. 

Panic surges. You scramble to open a drawer for pen and paper, but inside are only writhing earthworms and broken watch hands. Your colleagues, once familiar, now sit motionless at their desks, their chairs bolted to the floor. One turns slowly, their eyes hollow voids. “It’s never enough,” they whisper, their voice echoing from far away. 

The room temperature plummets. Frost creeps across your monitor as the deadline countdown—*3 HOURS REMAIN*—glows red, then flashes *2 HOURS 59 MINUTES*. You realize the numbers are bleeding through the screen, dripping onto your desk like wax. You try to scream, but your throat is sealed. Desperate, you hurl your chair at the window, only to watch it disintegrate into crows mid-air. 

Your boss’s shadow looms larger, their silhouette now towering, featureless except for a gaping mouth that yawns wider and wider. The floor tilts. You cling to the edge of your desk as the project files—now live, thrashing creatures—claw their way toward you. Somewhere, a phone rings. Once. Twice. 

And then you’re falling, the sound of shattering glass blending with your boss’s laughter, the document’s symbols swirling into a vortex as you— 

*Wake up, drenched in sweat, the echo of the clock’s ticking still buzzing in your ears.*
