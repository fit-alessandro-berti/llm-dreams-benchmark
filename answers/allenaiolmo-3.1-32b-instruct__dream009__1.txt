You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to find a way to communicate with the people here. Their clothes and tools are unfamiliar, and the language is strange yet oddly familiar. You notice a bustling marketplace nearby, and the scent of fresh bread draws you in. Deciding that food might be a universal language, you approach a stall and point at some bread, hoping to trade or buy. The vendor looks at you curiously and responds in a melodic tongue you don't understand. You gesture, miming eating and smiling, and the vendor grins, offering you a piece. As you share the bread, you begin to pick up simple words and gestures, realizing that curiosity, patience, and kindness might be your best tools in this new world.
