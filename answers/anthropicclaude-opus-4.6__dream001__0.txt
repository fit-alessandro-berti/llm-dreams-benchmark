# The Dream

You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to walk faster, pulling out your phone—but the screen is melting, the numbers dripping like wax down your fingers.

The streets keep shifting. A boulevard you were just walking down quietly becomes a narrow alley lined with doors in colors that don't exist in waking life—something between violet and the sound of a bell. You try one. It opens into a library that stretches upward forever, its shelves spiraling into a bruised sky where the ceiling should be.

"You're late," says a woman sitting at a desk made of stacked clocks, all showing different times. She has your mother's voice but a stranger's face.

"I don't know where I'm going," you admit.

She smiles and hands you a map, but when you unfold it, it's a drawing you made as a child—a crayon house with a yellow sun, a stick figure waving. Somehow you understand it perfectly.

You step back outside and the city has rearranged itself around you. The buildings are leaning in, whispering directions in a language you almost recognize. Your feet seem to know the way now. You're running—not with panic but with the effortless momentum of falling forward—and the pavement feels soft, like breathing.

You arrive at a door. Plain. Wooden. Familiar in the way a word becomes strange if you say it too many times, then suddenly becomes itself again.

You open it.

Inside, everyone is already seated around a long table. They turn to look at you, and with a slow, sinking clarity, you realize they all have *your* face—younger, older, versions you've been and versions you haven't yet. The oldest one, sitting at the far end with kind, tired eyes, gestures to an empty chair.

"We've been waiting," they say. "But you're not late. You're right on time."

You sit down. Someone slides a document across the table for you to sign. You look at it and see it contains every decision you've ever been afraid to make, written in your own handwriting.

You pick up the pen.

And just before you sign—just before the ink touches the page—you feel yourself beginning to wake, the edges of the room dissolving like sugar in water, all those faces blurring into morning light, and you're left holding onto a single feeling you can't quite name:

something between relief and readiness.
