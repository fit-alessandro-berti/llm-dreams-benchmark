…step outside to cool off. The instant you open the door, you aren’t in the familiar room anymore—you’re standing on a dock at the edge of a glassy, moonlit lake. Your friend is there too, but their words come out as flocks of birds that circle above you, and your own replies fall into the water as ripples that spread across the surface.

You both notice a small boat tied to the dock. Without speaking, you untie it and climb in, letting it drift. The lake carries you into a mist so thick you can’t see the shore, and in the silence the argument softens into a memory of why you care so much. When the mist clears, the boat has brought you back to the same dock, but now the lake is calm and the room beyond the door is full of warm light.

You step inside together, and the argument is gone—only the feeling that whatever the disagreement was, you’ll find a way through it. As you reach out to say something, you wake up with the echo of the lake still in your ears.
