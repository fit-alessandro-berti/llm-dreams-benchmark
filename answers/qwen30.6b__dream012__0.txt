**Dream Completed:**  

The storm raged like a beast, crashing like fury into the ship’s bow. Waves crashed over the deck, whispering secrets I could not hear. My crew gathered around me, their faces pale, eyes narrowed. They needed direction—this was our last chance to survive.  

"I’ve been thinking," I said, gripping my helm, "that the storm may not end now. It could *change* us." The wind howled, and I turned my gaze toward the horizon. "Our ship is at the edge of the world, and the storm is not just a storm—it’s *a test*."  

They followed my gaze, their voices low. I turned to them, "We trust each other, and we will not fear it. You all must lead, one by one." A silence followed as we stood together, the storm’s fury fading into a slow, quiet stillness.  

*Finally, the wind eased. The sea held on.*
