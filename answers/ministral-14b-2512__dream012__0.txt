**The Dream Unfolds:**

The wind howls like a living thing, tearing at the sails with jagged teeth. Salt spray stings your face as you grip the wheel, your knuckles white beneath the strain. The ship *groans*—a deep, mournful sound, as if the very timbers are debating whether to hold or break. Lightning splits the sky, illuminating the churning waves for a single, breathless second: black as ink, crowned with froth like the manes of drowned horses.

Your first mate, a grizzled woman with a scar across her palm, shouts over the storm: *"Captain! The starboard rigging—it’s snapping like twine!"* You don’t need to look. You *feel* it—the ship’s spine bending, the deck tilting beneath your boots. The crew moves like ghosts, lashing themselves to the rails, their faces pale with the knowledge that this storm is no ordinary tempest. It’s *hungry*.

Then—*a sound*. Not the wind. Not the creaking wood. A *voice*, carried on the gale, but not from the sky. From the *water*.

*"You should have turned back."*

The words slither into your mind, wet and cold as a drowned man’s kiss. You know that voice. You’ve heard it in the dark, in the spaces between heartbeats. It’s the voice of the sea itself—or what lurks beneath it.

Your second-in-command, a young sailor with hands too small for the weight of command, points a trembling finger toward the horizon. *"Captain… the water’s moving. *Wrong*."*

You squint. The waves aren’t just crashing—they’re *parting*. A swirling vortex, dark as a bruise, opens in the storm’s eye. And from its depths, something rises.

Not a ship. Not a whale. Something *older*. Its shape shifts between the glimpses the lightning grants: a mastless hull with too many eyes, a face stitched from kelp and bone, a mouth full of teeth that aren’t teeth at all but *hooks*, glistening with something that isn’t water.

The crew freezes. Even the storm seems to hold its breath.

Then the thing *speaks* again, and this time, the words are in your *bones*:

*"You took what wasn’t yours."*

And you remember.

Not the storm. Not the ship. Not even your name.

You remember *the choice*.

**What do you do, Captain?**

*(Do you fight? Do you bargain? Do you let the sea take you—or do you let it take* something *else?)*
