# The Dream

You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **plant a garden**.

It sounds absurd. You know it sounds absurd. The sky is the color of a bruise that never heals, and the wind carries dust that tastes like iron and forgotten cities. The others in your small band — Maren with her sharpened rebar, Old Kai who remembers *before*, the twins who never speak — they stare at you like you've finally cracked.

But you kneel in the cracked earth behind the collapsed overpass, and you dig with your bare hands.

You don't know where the seeds came from. You found them in a rusted tin inside a dead woman's coat pocket — little papery promises, each one a universe folded tight. You don't even know what they'll grow into. You plant them anyway.

Days pass. You guard the patch of soil like it's a sleeping child. You carry water from the brown creek half a mile east, filtering it through charcoal and old fabric. Raiders pass nearby. You stay quiet. The earth stays quiet too.

Then one morning — **a green thread pushes through the gray.**

Maren sees it first. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there, her weapon lowering slowly, and something in her face shifts — something ancient and involuntary, like a door opening in a room she'd forgotten existed.

Old Kai weeps. He doesn't explain why. He doesn't need to.

Within weeks, others come. Not to take — to *see*. Word travels in the wasteland like mycelium through soil: *someone is growing something alive.* They bring what they have. A woman trades ammunition for the privilege of sitting beside the garden for an hour. A scarred man arrives carrying a jar of honey he's protected for three years, waiting for something worthy enough to open it for.

The garden becomes a library, a temple, a embassy. Not because of what it produces — the yield is small, scraggly, imperfect — but because of what it **represents**. A declaration, stubborn and luminous, that the future is still worth investing in. That putting something in the ground and waiting is not naivety. It is the most radical act left.

One night you sit among the growing things and realize: you are not rebuilding the old world. You are composting it. Letting it decay into something that can nourish what comes next — something you won't live to see, something you can't control, something that will be **strange and green and entirely its own.**

The twins speak for the first time. They say the same word, together:

*"More."*

You hand them seeds.

---

*And then, as dreams do, the edges soften. The garden expands beyond what soil should allow. Vines climb the rusted skeletons of skyscrapers. Roots crack through highways. You look down at your hands and they are covered in earth, and the earth is warm, and you understand that you were never just planting a garden.*

*You were planting the question: **What if we still deserve to begin again?***

*And the ground answers yes.*
