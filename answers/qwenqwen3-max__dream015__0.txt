...build a library.

Not out of naivety, but defiance.  

The sky is the color of rust, and the wind carries ash that stings your eyes. Canned peaches ran out months ago, and the last working radio crackled its final warning three winters back. Raiders roam the skeletal remains of cities, and mutated coyotes howl under a moon that feels too close, too bright. Survival is a daily arithmetic of bullets, calories, and trust—none of which you have in abundance.  

But in the hollowed-out husk of an old elementary school, shielded by a collapsed gymnasium that blocks the worst of the dust storms, you start.  

You scavenge first: water-stained paperbacks from flooded basements, charred textbooks half-burned in abandoned classrooms, a child’s picture book fused shut by heat but still bearing the ghost of a giraffe on its cover. You trade a can of precious beans for a librarian’s salvaged card catalog—its drawers still intact, labels peeling but legible. You barter a hand-stitched bandage for a rusted but functional stapler.  

You don’t just collect. You *curate*.  

Each book is a lifeline you refuse to let sink. You dry pages over low coals, press warped covers under salvaged bricks, and transcribe crumbling poetry onto scavenged ledger paper with ink made from soot and rainwater. You label sections not by genre, but by what they offer the soul: *Hope* (botany guides, fairy tales), *Memory* (cookbooks, photo albums), *Warning* (history texts, engineering manuals), and *Dreams* (maps of places that no longer exist, star charts).  

One day, a gaunt teenager with wary eyes appears at the broken doorway, clutching a single, water-swollen copy of *The Wind in the Willows*. "They said you take books," she rasps, voice raw from thirst. "Not steal. *Take*." You nod, offer her clean water, and show her where the shelf for "Dreams" is. She stays to help repair spines with salvaged duct tape.  

Then others come. Not with guns, but with offerings: a diary, a manual on fixing bicycle chains, a stack of yellowed sheet music. They whisper stories in the quiet space between shelves—stories of what was, what could be. The library becomes a compass. A promise.  

The world outside is ending, again and again. But here, in the dust and the quiet, you are building an ark made of words. And arks, you remember, are meant to carry more than just one person through the flood.
