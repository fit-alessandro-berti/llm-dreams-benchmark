You start to wander through the city’s labyrinthine streets, the towering buildings shifting slightly as if the city itself is breathing. The sun hangs low, casting long shadows that twist into shapes you can’t quite name. You clutch a crumpled map that seems to change when you look away, its ink bleeding into the pavement. A voice echoes in your mind—*“The meeting is not where you think it is. It’s where you *are*.”*  

You pause, confused. The voice isn’t coming from anywhere specific, yet it feels intimately familiar. Suddenly, a child appears beside you, no older than five, wearing a coat made of starlight. They point to a door in a building that wasn’t there a moment ago. Inside, the room is filled with floating clocks, each ticking backward. A figure in a suit made of smoke stands at the center, smiling.  

*“You’re late,”* they say, though their tone is oddly calm. *“But time here is a suggestion. The meeting is about letting go of the need to know where you’re going.”*  

The clocks stop. The room dissolves into a field of mirrors, each reflecting a different version of you—some confident, some lost, some smiling. You realize the meeting isn’t about a physical location but a moment of clarity. The child nods. *“Find the mirror that shows you the truth. It’s the one that doesn’t lie.”*  

You search, and finally, one mirror shows you standing in the city square, holding a key. The key fits a door you hadn’t noticed before, leading to a room where the meeting is already happening: a group of people, including you, sitting in a circle, sharing stories. The “meeting” is a conversation about dreams, uncertainty, and the beauty of not knowing.  

When you wake up, you’re back in your bed, the city gone. But you feel a strange peace, as if you’ve attended the meeting all along. The key is still in your hand, warm and real.
