You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **blend in quickly or risk being burned as a witch—or worse, a demon spy from the stars**.

The air is thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth. Cobblestone streets wind between timber-framed houses, their thatched roofs sagging like weary eyelids. Men in woolen tunics and leather breeches haul carts of turnips and live chickens, while women in hooded kirtles gossip by a bubbling well, their eyes flicking toward you with suspicion. It's medieval Europe, maybe 14th-century England, judging by the distant toll of a church bell and the muddy banners fluttering from a stone-walled castle on the hill.

Your modern clothes—jeans, sneakers, that faded band tee—stick out like a glowing smartphone in a blackout. A grizzled blacksmith pauses his hammering to squint at you, muttering "Sorcerer's garb" under his breath. Kids scatter like pigeons, whispering "Stranger from the faerie realm!"

Heart pounding, you duck into a shadowed alley. First things first: improvise a disguise. You spot a laundry line strung with roughspun cloaks and snag a brown one, wrapping it around yourself like a toga reject. Your hair's a mess—good, it passes for "plague survivor chic." But hunger gnaws at you, and thirst is a desert in your throat.

Venturing to the market square, you barter clumsily with a toothless pie-seller, trading a shiny button from your pocket (ripped from your jeans) for a greasy meat pasty that tastes like mystery and regret. "Ye hail from the New Worlde?" she cackles. You nod vaguely, mumbling in what you hope is Old English: "Aye, far traveler."

As the sun dips, casting the world in bloody orange, you overhear tavern talk of a brewing war—barons clashing over a cursed crown. A hooded figure slips you a note: "The alchemist seeks one like thee. Midnight, under the oak." Opportunity? Trap? Your dream-self thrills with reckless curiosity.

You slip toward the oak grove, pulse racing, the era's dangers wrapping around you like fog. But as your fingers brush the tree's bark, the world warps—colors bleed, the ground tilts—and you jolt awake in your bed, sheets tangled, phone buzzing with notifications. Just a dream... or was it? The faint scent of woodsmoke lingers.
