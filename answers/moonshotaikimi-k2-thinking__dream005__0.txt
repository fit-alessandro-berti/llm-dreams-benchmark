...the first group you approach is laughing in perfect unison, their champagne glasses clinking at precisely the same angle. As you ask about your friend, their faces blur like wet paint, and suddenly they're all wearing her green coat—but none of them are her.

You back away and find yourself in a corridor that wasn't there before. The walls are made of murmuring voices, each whispering different directions. "She's by the ice sculpture," they sigh, but when you turn the corner, the sculpture is melting into the shape of your elementary school desk. A man in a tuxedo is sitting behind it, grading papers with a red pen that bleeds light.

Someone touches your shoulder. You spin around—it's a woman with your friend's laugh, but she's made of stained glass, and behind her ribs you can see a small fire burning. "We've been waiting," she says, but her voice comes from the chandelier above, which is now an enormous compass spinning wildly.

The room shifts again. You're suddenly in a garden of hands—hundreds of them, sprouting from the floor like flowers, each holding a glowing phone screen. The screens all show a text from your friend that says "here," but the timestamp keeps changing: 3 minutes ago, 2 hours from now, yesterday, never.

You run toward a mirror on the far wall, because you catch a glimpse of her scarf. But when you reach it, the reflection shows only you—except you're also the crowd, and the crowd is also the wallpaper, and the wallpaper is peeling away to reveal the sky, except the stars are all watching you with patient, familiar eyes.

Your phone buzzes. It's her: "Did you get lost?" But the message is written in your own handwriting, and the sender is " Kitchen Utensils." You look up and realize the whole gathering has become a single table, infinite in length, set for a dinner where every plate holds a tiny, spinning version of the party you're still trying to leave.

You take a step. The floor ripples. Someone who might be her waves from the end of the table, but the distance between you is measured in unsolved questions, and you're holding a map drawn in rain.
