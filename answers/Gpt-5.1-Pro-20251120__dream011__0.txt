…wrong.

Not just a little wrong—*completely* wrong.

The first question reads:

> 1. At what exact moment did you decide to become the person you are now?

There are four multiple choice answers, all of them absurd:

A. When you were three and misunderstood what “forever” meant
B. The first time you lied and nobody noticed
C. When you chose the window seat instead of the aisle
D. You never decided; it was decided for you

You flip the page, assuming this is some kind of elaborate preamble, but it only gets stranger.

> 2. Solve for **x**, where **x** is the number of days you’ve pretended not to be afraid.

The formula underneath is nonsense—symbols that look familiar from math, but rearranged like alphabet soup. Your brain tries to parse it anyway, the way dreams make you attempt the impossible with complete sincerity.

You look around the exam hall.

No one else seems bothered. They all bend over their papers, writing furiously. From where you’re sitting, you can’t quite see their faces; they’re blurred, as if someone smudged them with the side of a thumb on a charcoal drawing. But you hear the scratch of pens, the turning of pages, someone sighing with relief, someone else quietly panicking.

You glance up at the clock.

The hands aren’t moving, but the second hand is vibrating, buzzing in place like it wants to jump ahead but can’t. The time reads 9:00. It will keep reading 9:00, you somehow know, even when you’re out of time.

You look back at the exam.

> 3. Show your work: Explain why you abandoned the version of yourself who still believed anything was possible.

Below it, five blank lines.

Your pen feels heavy in your hand. You write your name at the top of the page, but the letters come out wrong—slightly shifted, like your name in another language you almost recognize but can’t pronounce.

A shadow falls across your desk.

You look up. The proctor is standing there.

You’d swear it was someone you know, but every time you try to fix on their face, it changes—teacher, parent, manager, stranger, back to teacher. Their expression is impossible to read.

“Is there a problem?” they ask.

The voice is calm, but the sound is slightly out of sync with their lips, like a dubbed movie.

“This… isn’t the right test,” you say, though you’re not completely sure what the right test *would* be.

The proctor tilts their head. “The test is always the same.”

They tap your paper with one finger. When their finger touches it, the ink on the page ripples, as if it’s written on water instead of paper.

“The questions are tailored,” they add. “You prepared for this.”

You try to remember what you studied. Textbooks? Notes? Slides? All you find in your memory is a blur of nights where you told yourself you’d start tomorrow.

You flip further ahead.

Question 7 is just a mirror printed in cheap grayscale: your own face staring back at you, eyes slightly off-center, as if the image was taken mid-blink.

Question 10 reads:

> 10. List three dreams you outgrew and three that outgrew you.

Question 15:

> 15. Without using any numbers, quantify your fear of wasting your life.

You skip to the end, desperate to find at least *one* normal question.

The very last one is:

> 50. Extra credit (mandatory):
>     If you didn’t have to prove yourself to anyone, what would you do next?
>     Be specific.

You stare at it. Every answer you think of feels like something you’re supposed to say. Something responsible, impressive, defensible. Not necessarily true.

The proctor is still at your side. “You’re losing time,” they say.

You point at the clock. “It’s not moving.”

They smile, but it’s not comforting. “It doesn’t have to move for you to run out.”

You try to write something—anything—but the pen suddenly doesn’t work. You shake it. A tiny crack opens on the tip, and instead of ink, sand begins to pour out, grain by grain, onto your exam paper, slowly burying the questions.

You brush it away, panicking, but the more you brush, the more it spreads.

Sand under your nails. Sand in the binding of the exam booklet. Sand in the seams of the desk.

The proctor steps back, watching, hands folded behind their back, as if this is all part of the process.

“I don’t know how to answer these,” you say, your voice cracking. “These aren’t on the syllabus.”

The proctor walks to the front of the room. With each step, the floor shifts from tile to beach sand. By the time they reach the podium, the entire exam hall has turned into a shoreline, desks half-sunk, legs buried.

Outside the window, the campus is gone. There’s only ocean, stretching out in all directions, slate-gray and endless. Waves rise and fall in slow motion, like someone playing the world at half speed.

The proctor clears their throat.

“To clarify,” they say to the room, “you wrote the syllabus.”

Everybody keeps writing, unfazed.

You look down at your exam again.

The questions have changed.

Now, in large bold letters at the top of the first page:

> FINAL EXAM: CHOOSING A LIFE
> Instructions: There are no wrong answers. There are only answers you’ll have to live with.

The sand on your desk is piling up faster. You realize it isn’t coming from the pen anymore; it’s leaking out from between the pages of the exam, as if the paper itself is disintegrating.

You stand up suddenly. Your chair scrapes against the floor, though you’re standing on sand now, not tile. Some of the other test-takers look up—just for a second. Their faces almost come into focus: a version of you at seventeen, another at nine, another from three weeks ago. All of them go back to writing.

“I’m not ready,” you say, to no one in particular.

The proctor looks directly at you for the first time. Their face finally settles—into something uncomfortably familiar.

It’s your own face. Older, maybe. Or just more tired.

“No one ever is,” they say. “You answer anyway.”

You look at the exam one more time.

Most of the questions are gone, buried. But three remain, visible between dunes of sand:

> 4. What are you pretending you don’t want?
> 5. When you are alone with your thoughts, what do they circle back to?
> 6. If you didn’t have to prove yourself to anyone, what would you do next?

You don’t know the *correct* answers. But you know the honest ones.

Your hand moves almost on its own. The pen writes smoothly now, though you’re not entirely sure what you’re writing until it’s already there on the page. Short phrases. A place. A person. A kind of work. Something you’ve been calling “impractical” for years. Something you’ve been telling yourself is for “later.”

The more you write, the slower the sand falls. Grain by grain, it eases, then stops.

The walls of the exam hall dissolve—quietly, like fog lifting. The other students fade, the desks evaporate. Even the proctor—your older self—begins to turn translucent, like light seen through rain.

“Time,” they say gently, though the clock above is now just a blank circle on the wall.

You expect to feel dread. Shame. That familiar squeeze of *I blew it*.

Instead, there’s just… space. A strange, raw lightness in your chest, like you’ve just exhaled after holding your breath for years.

You look back at the exam booklet.

It’s no longer covered in sand. It’s not even an exam anymore.

It’s a map.

Not a detailed one: just a rough outline, a few landmarks, an arrow pointing in a particular direction. Some of the lines are shaky where your hand trembled.

At the top, where your name should be, it says:

> THIS IS NOT FINAL. YOU MAY REVISE.

You pick up the map. The room is gone now; it’s just you, standing at the edge of something wide and undefined.

A wind rises from nowhere, catching the corners of the paper. For a terrified second, you think it’s going to tear it out of your hands and carry it away—but it doesn’t.

It just flutters.

The ocean has retreated. In its place is a long, sprawling shoreline, scattered with paths leading inland. Some are well-trodden. Some are barely visible. One of them matches the rough line you drew on the paper.

Behind you, a voice—your own, but from somewhere else—whispers, “You can still choose.”

You take a step forward, clutching the map.

The sand under your feet firms into ground.

You feel yourself starting to wake up, the dream fraying at the edges. The exam, the hall, the proctor, the ocean—they all pull away from you like scenery being rolled back.

As everything fades, only one fragment of the test remains, echoing in your mind:

> There are no wrong answers. There are only answers you’ll have to live with.

You open your eyes.

For a moment, you’re not sure where you are. Ceiling. Light. The texture of familiar sheets under your hands. Your heart is still racing as if you’re late for something.

You lie there, staring at nothing, replaying question 50.

*If you didn’t have to prove yourself to anyone, what would you do next?*

The dream is already starting to blur, as dreams do. But that question stays sharp, lodged in the front of your mind like a bookmark.

You realize you don’t need the exam to answer it.

You’re awake.

The test, inconveniently, is here.
