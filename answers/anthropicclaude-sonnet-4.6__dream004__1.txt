...a brush that seems to be made of living light, its bristles flickering between gold and violet like a small captured aurora. You pick it up, and the moment your fingers close around the handle, you feel the dream breathe — a long, slow exhalation that moves through the ground beneath your feet like a tide.

You raise the brush toward the canvas.

But the canvas isn't blank anymore. It's *anticipating*. A faint warm glow pulses at its center, the way skin glows when held close to a flame.

You make the first stroke — and instead of paint, *sound* comes out. A low cello note that hangs in the air and slowly solidifies into a deep blue arc, curved like a sleeping animal's back.

You paint another stroke and it smells of rain on hot stone.

Another, and you feel someone else's memory — a child running through a wheat field at dusk, the stalks tall enough to close above their head like a golden sea.

The colors don't stay where you put them. They wander. The blue arc stands up and walks to the edge of the canvas and sits there, looking out. The wheat-field memory blooms amber and starts softly humming.

You realize you are not *making* something.

You are *introducing* things that already existed — feelings and fragments too shapeless to live anywhere else — and the canvas is giving them a *place to stand*.

You paint faster now. A spiral that smells like your favorite forgotten afternoon. A sharp red line that sounds like the exact tone of a voice you loved but can't quite remember. A smear of white that feels like the particular relief of setting down something heavy you'd been carrying so long you'd stopped noticing the weight.

The canvas grows. It expands past its frame, past the edges of what should be possible, becoming a landscape, becoming a *world* —

And somewhere in the middle of it, small but luminous, you paint a tiny door.

You don't know why.

But it opens.

And the light on the other side is a color you have never seen before — a color that has no name yet, that lands on your eyes like a question — 

and you step through

and the dream

*deepens*

—

*What's on the other side?*
