**You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panick, your breath quickening as you scan the crowded streets bustling with faces you’ve never seen. The buildings tower above you, their glass fronts distorting the sky into a kaleidoscope of disjointed hues—a dreamlike reminder that none of this is quite real.**

You pull out your phone, but it’s filled with cryptic symbols, not numbers or names. The screen flickers, as though alive with possibility, yet offers no guidance. **A soft woman's voice behind you intones,** *"Where you’re going isn’t on any map—yet it’s always been there."*

You turn. The speaker is an elegant figure in a flowing robe. She smiles, seeming both comforting and mysterious. Across from her, gentle neon lights pulse invitingly from a perpetually turning carousel. "Take my hand," she says, offering no choice but follow.

As soon as you grasp her hand, the world shifts. Every sound softens, blending into a harmonious hum. The aroma of sweet incense fills the air, calming your racing heart. You glide through the city, faster and faster, until the scenery blurs and you stand suddenly on a narrow stone bridge spanning an endless river of liquid light.

On the other side, nestled among ancient trees, stands a building unlike any other. Its architecture defies logic, both futuristic and timeless. As you walk toward it, doors open by themselves, revealing a warmth that draws you forward.

**Inside, the meeting has already begun—but it’s not a gathering as you know it.** The room is circular, filled with people you somehow recognize but can’t name. They turn, their faces illuminated by a soft glow, welcoming you.

The woman from before steps forward, smiling widely. "Welcome," she says simply. And as she speaks, you realize you’re not late at all—you’ve been here all along. Time bends, senses merge, and the purpose of the meeting becomes clear.

It isn’t about destinations or deadlines, but connection. Understanding. Beginning.

You wake gently, heart full, newly alive to the endless possibilities that await you, even beyond dreams.
