Ah, the exam begins—and the questions are *alive*. The paper ripples like water, the ink shifting between lines as if breathing. The first question glows faintly, pulsing like a heartbeat:

**"What is the weight of your greatest fear?"**

You hesitate. The question isn’t multiple-choice; it’s a *door*. If you answer honestly, the next question might open. If you lie, the paper crumples into a moth that flaps against your desk, its wings leaving trails of tiny, burning questions in the air.

The second question appears, scrawled in a handwriting that wasn’t there a second ago:
**"Describe the sound of the moment you stopped believing in yourself."**

The room tilts. The clock on the wall ticks backward. The third question materializes in the space above your head, floating like a lantern:
**"If you could erase one memory from this exam, which would it be?"**

Then—silence. The paper goes blank. The air hums. And suddenly, you realize the exam isn’t testing *you*. It’s testing whether *you* will test *it*.

Would you like to explore a specific path? (E.g., the moth’s questions, the backward clock, or the lantern’s silence?) Or should we dive deeper into the fear/desire paradox?
