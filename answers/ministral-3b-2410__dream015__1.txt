You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers lurking around every corner. Despite the hardships, you decide to embark on a journey to find the fabled "Green Zone," a place said to be untouched by the chaos and where resources are abundant. Armed with a makeshift bow, a knife, and a backpack filled with essentials, you set off into the unknown, hoping to find hope and a new beginning. As you walk, the sun dips below the horizon, casting long shadows and creating an eerie atmosphere. You hear the distant howl of a lone wolf, and the echoes of empty buildings that once served as homes for people now lie in ruins. The only sound that breaks the silence is the crunching of your boots on the cracked asphalt beneath your feet. You continue to walk, driven by the hope that the Green Zone will one day be within your reach.
