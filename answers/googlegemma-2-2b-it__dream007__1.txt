You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **take a break**.  

The words hang in the air, thick and heavy, like the smoke from a forgotten campfire.  We're both breathing hard, our faces flushed, the silence between us a tangible thing, pressing in on us.  I can feel the heat of my anger radiating off my skin, and I know I'm about to say something I'll regret.  

Instead, I push back from the table, my chair scraping against the floor, and say, "I need a minute."  My friend, usually quick to retort, looks at me with a flicker of surprise, then nods, a silent understanding passing between us. 

We both stand up, the tension easing slightly.  I walk to the window, the cool night air a welcome contrast to the heat of the argument.  I look out at the city, the lights blurring into a kaleidoscope of colors.  The argument, the anger, it all seems so distant, like a faded memory. 

I take a deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart.  I know we need to talk, to understand each other, but right now, I need space.  I need to process what's been said, to let the anger subside, to see the situation with a clearer mind. 

When I turn back, my friend is already gone.  I feel a pang of disappointment, but also a sense of relief.  We both need this space, this time to breathe, to think, to understand.  

I know we'll talk again, and when we do, we'll be able to have a real conversation, a conversation that doesn't feel like a battle.  A conversation that can lead us back to the friendship we cherish. 


**What happens next?** 

* Do we talk later that night?
* Do we avoid each other for a while?
* Does the dream continue with a new conflict? 
* Do we find a way to resolve the argument?
