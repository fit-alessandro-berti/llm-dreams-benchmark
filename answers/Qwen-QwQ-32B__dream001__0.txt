... stumble toward a neon-lit intersection where the street signs flicker between numbers and symbols. A pocket watch materializes in your hand, its face showing Roman numerals that shift into alien glyphs. The air hums with the sound of a distant clock tower, but the closer you walk, the more the buildings warp—skyscrapers tilt like melting Salvador Dalí clocks, and the pavement cracks to reveal glowing equations beneath your feet.  

A figure in a trench coat steps from a shadow, offering a crumpled map stained with coffee rings that spell out coordinates in binary. Before you can take it, their face dissolves into a mosaic of your own reflected eyes, each pupil flickering with a countdown: *42:17 remaining*.  

You turn a corner and find yourself at an alley lined with doors, each labeled with a number. The first reads **π**, the next **√(-1)**, and the last simply **∞**. A voice in your ear whispers, *“Time is a loop here—choose the key, not the path.”*  

As you reach for the π door, the ground rumbles. The city folds upward, revealing a clock tower floating above an ocean of starlight. Its gears are made of human hands clutching papers, and the bell tolls once, echoing the rhythm of your heartbeat.  

What do you do?  

*(The dream’s logic bends to your choices—will you follow the math, trust the stranger’s echo, or sprint toward the tower’s beckoning shadow?)*

*Note: The pocket watch’s glyphs correspond to solutions of \( \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + y = 0 \), but the city’s rules may not care about differential equations.*
