...each group seems to pull you in a different direction.

In the first group, a circle of artists loudly debates abstract concepts, their hands gesturing wildly as they paint vivid mental images with their words. One, noticing your hesitation, laughs and says, *"You look lost—come, help us decide if dreams are just memories of the future!"* But before you can answer, a wave of laughter erupts from a nearby cluster of musicians tuning instruments that shimmer like liquid gold. A violinist plucks a note that hums in your chest, and suddenly you’re drawn toward them, forgetting the artists entirely.

Then, just as you’re about to join, a cold hand grips your wrist. A masked figure in a tattered suit whispers, *"They’re all distractions. Follow me—we’re playing a game."* Their voice is familiar, but before you can ask, they vanish into a crowd of laughing, dancing figures whose features blur whenever you try to focus.

Panic prickles at your neck—where *is* the person you know? You push through the crowd, only to stumble into a quiet corner where an old woman sits alone, sorting a deck of tarot cards. She doesn’t look up but murmurs, *"You’re looking for someone who’s already looking for you."* The cards shuffle themselves; one flips face-up: a mirror.

And then—there they are, standing across the room, their eyes locking onto yours just as a deafening bell tolls. The entire gathering freezes. The lights flicker. And before you can reach them, the floor drops away...

*(Would you like a surreal, eerie, or hopeful ending for this dream? I can tailor it further!)*
