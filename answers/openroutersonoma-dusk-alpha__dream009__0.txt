adapt to this ancient world to survive, so you start by blending in with the locals—dressing in rough-spun tunics and learning their tongue through gestures and eavesdropping. The air smells of woodsmoke and earth, and as you wander through bustling markets filled with merchants hawking spices and silks, a mysterious figure in a hooded cloak approaches, whispering that you hold the key to a long-forgotten prophecy. Suddenly, the ground trembles, and shadows twist into ethereal creatures, pulling you into an adventure where you must navigate alliances, unravel riddles from crumbling scrolls, and confront the era's dark sorcery, all while yearning for the hum of your lost smartphone. Just as victory seems within reach, the dream fades, leaving you back in bed, wondering if it was all a vivid escape from the mundane.
