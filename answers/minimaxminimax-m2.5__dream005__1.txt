You weave through the glittering crowd, the echo of champagne glasses and soft jazz winding around you like a silken ribbon. The ballroom is a cathedral of light—chandeliers drip crystal rain, and the walls seem to breathe with the hum of a hundred conversations.

First you stumble upon a cluster of women in vintage dresses, their hair pinned in Victory rolls, whispering secrets over teacups that steam in the cool night air. Their laughter is low and conspiratorial, and one of them catches your eye, tilting her head as if to say, *“You’re looking for someone, aren’t you?”* You nod, and she gestures toward a hallway lined with portraits that seem to shift as you pass, their eyes following your movement.

Turning the corner, you find a group of men in sharp suits, each holding a lantern that casts flickering shadows on the walls. They’re playing a game of chess on a giant marble board, the pieces moving on their own, each move accompanied by a soft chime. One of them, with a silver beard and a watch that ticks backward, looks up and smiles. “The one you seek is near the garden,” he says, his voice a echo of wind through leaves. He points to a door framed by climbing roses, the petals glowing faintly in the moonlight.

You push through the door and step into a sprawling garden that seems to stretch beyond the horizon. The air is thick with the scent of jasmine and night-blooming orchids. A group of children, their faces painted with luminous stars, dance in a circle around a fountain that sprays water that changes color with each splash—silver, gold, violet. They chant a rhyme that sounds like a lullaby, and as they spin, they leave trails of light that converge toward a distant gazebo.

Following the glowing trails, you arrive at the gazebo, its wooden beams draped in ivy. There, standing by a small table set with tea and a single slice of lemon cake, is the person you know—your old friend, Maya. She looks up, her eyes bright with recognition, and a warm smile spreads across her face.

“Finally,” she says, her voice a familiar melody in the chaos of the dream. “I’ve been waiting for you.”

She offers you a seat, and as you sit, the garden around you begins to quiet. The chatter of the earlier groups fades into a soft hum, and the lanterns in the distance dim to a gentle glow. The night feels still, as if the entire gathering has paused just for the two of you.

Maya pours tea, the steam curling upward like a shy ghost. “You’ve been wandering a long time,” she says. “But you found me. That’s what matters.”

You take a sip, the taste of chamomile and honey filling you with a comforting warmth. The dream settles into a quiet contentment, the earlier frenetic energy softening into a peaceful lull. The stars above seem to wink, and the garden’s lights shimmer like fireflies, promising that the night—however surreal—will carry you gently back to the waking world.
