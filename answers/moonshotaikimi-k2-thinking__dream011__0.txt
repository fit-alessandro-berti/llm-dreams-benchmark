written in something wet and shimmering on the page—ink that refuses to dry, pooling like mercury in the margins. The first question reads:

**"Describe the sound of your mother's voice before you were born, using only prime numbers and the taste of copper."**

You stare at it, and the words begin to slide down the paper, dripping onto your desk where they sizzle softly, leaving small holes in the wood. The invigilator—a figure made of static in the shape of your grade school principal—shooshes you with a finger that dissolves into moths when you try to focus on it.

**Question 2 is a photograph of your own hands, but they're older, liver-spotted, and they're holding a scalpel you've never seen before. Below it, the prompt says: "This is what you will use. Explain why you remember it anyway."**

When you touch the photograph, it becomes warm, then hot. You jerk back, and the image has already changed—now your hands are holding a baby you don't recognize. The exam paper seems to breathe, swelling and contracting with a rhythm that matches your pulse but slightly out of sync, like a heart in another room.

**Question 3 is simply a small, perfect circle of silence that has been cut out of the air above the page.** You realize you can pick it up, and when you do, all sound vanishes. The static-principal is still moving their mouth, but you hear nothing. The instruction beneath reads: **"Place this in your left ear. You will need it for Question 7."**

But there are only six questions, you think, and as you think it, a seventh appears, written in the steam of your own breath on a mirror that has materialized in the middle of the desk. The question is your own face, but your eyes are wrong—one is the color of your father's, and the other is a keyhole.

**The final question is the desk itself.** You realize this when you try to stand and find your legs have become part of the chair, which is now growing into the floor, which is made of layered exam papers from every test you've ever failed. The question is not written but felt—a deep, cellular-level vibration asking: **"If you pass, you become the building. If you fail, you wake up. Choose."**

You look around. The other students are already gone, or maybe they were never there. The windows show not the campus but the inside of your childhood bedroom, and your younger self is inside, taking a different exam, one you can see but never reach.

The static-principal leans close, their face resolving for just a moment into your own face, twenty years older, and whispers: **"Time's up. You were never enrolled in this course. You are the answer key."**

And with that, the ink begins to flow backward, up your arms, rewriting the veins beneath your skin with the correct answers—which are all questions you haven't thought to ask yet.
