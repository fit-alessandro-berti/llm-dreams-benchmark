You start to wander the labyrinthine streets, noticing that the buildings shimmer ever so slightly at the edges, as if unfinished. The crowds around you move with purpose, faces blurred, voices merging into a low, urgent hum. You reach into your pocket and discover a small, hand-drawn map, its lines shifting each time you blink.

With growing determination, you follow the map’s direction toward a tower at the city’s heart. Each step you take, the streets rearrange themselves, but you somehow always end up at the same intersection with a blue clock tower that never shows the right time. Anxiety prickles—you can’t be late.

A stranger approaches, their face flickering between familiarity and blankness. “You’re looking for something, aren’t you?” they say, offering a silver key. “Sometimes, you can only find your destination by unlocking the wrong doors first.” As you reach for the key, the city’s distant bells begin to toll, echoing through the mist, and you know you have to choose: trust the stranger, or keep running through the shifting shadows.
