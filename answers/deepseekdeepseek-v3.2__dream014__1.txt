...you hesitate for only a moment before nodding gratefully. Their faces are a blur of warm smiles and gentle eyes. Without a word, they form a loose circle around you, not trapping you, but sheltering you from the jostling crowd.

You begin to walk, not on the hard pavement, but down a narrow alley you had missed, draped with ivy and twinkling fairy lights. The sound of the city fades, replaced by the soft murmur of their voices pointing out hidden things: a mural of a soaring bird, the scent of bread from a basement bakery, a tiny door for cats at the base of a wall.

You realize you are no longer looking for your original destination. The "way" they are helping you find isn't on any map. With each step, the tight knot of loneliness in your chest begins to loosen, untangling in the quiet certainty of their presence. You are still in the unknown, but you are not lost. You are being guided, and for now, in the warm, golden light of the dream-strangers' kindness, that is more than enough.
