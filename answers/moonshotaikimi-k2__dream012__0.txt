…raise your hand and the sea stills—just for a heartbeat, as if it, too, is waiting for orders.

“Keep her cutting true,” I tell them, voice rolling over the wind like a second thunder. My boots smack across the pitching deck to the helm, where the great wheel bucks like a kite’s tail. The wood is alive under my palms, and I can feel the hull breathing through it, a wounded lung below us.

“Strike the fore-tops’l!” I shout. The mate hesitates—he always hates to shorten canvas when the storm still hungers—but repeats the order until the yardarm spills its white belly like a gutted swan. Rain lashes my eyes, and in those blurred slats of silver I see shapes on the water—three wingless birds, black and knife-edged, riding the crests.

Not birds. Ships. Smaller than mine, square sails reefed to dark triangles, flying like crows on wind that should sink them. They move against gale and logic, carving troughs that don’t vanish behind them. They’re dragons, or dreams-of-dragons, chasing something inside the storm itself.

My navigator, a girl with kelp in her hair and compasses tattooed on her wrists, scrambles up beside me. “Captain, the charts are bleeding.” She thrusts the brass cylinder at me; inside the parchment of the sea charts blisters and weeps black ink that curls like smoke. Yet if I squint, the spreading blot resembles an archipelago none of us have sailed—seven islands shaped like vertebrae, floating in the sky instead of the sea. The final island bears a lighthouse whose beam is aimed not out, but down, straight at us.

I feel the ship shudder—suddenly the deck tilts upward, not side to side. The prow lifts, the hull groans like it’s being born. Up ahead an opening appears in the storm, a vortex of white veined with cobalt lightning. The dragon-ships dart into it, hulls glowing hot as iron.

“They’re not running from the storm,” I realize. “They’re the tether. And we’re the anchor.”

A voice I have never heard before—my father’s voice, though he drowned when I was ten—slides along the wind: If you cut the line, you sever one world from another, but you might just set yours free.

“Mains’l double-reefed!” the bosun cries above the thunder. “But she still drags!”

I look to my crew—faces tattooed with constellations, salt muting the colors of their coats. They aren’t afraid; they’re waiting. For me to finish the sentence the sea itself has started speaking.

I press my palm to the wheel, to the tree-ringed bones of the ship, and I can feel her heartbeat appallingly human beneath the oak and tar. She wants to follow those birds and their impossible turn against the wind. She wants to climb the cyclone’s spine and slip the world like a skin.

“Let her,” I say.

Loose the lines. Let every sail flare bright as a second moon. Let the keel leave water and bite sky. Let us skim the bones of the world until we scrape bright.

The crew grins—a foxfire flash of teeth—and the wind hears me. It leaps into the canvas, the ship kicks free, and we rise, trembling like newborn smoke. Below us the sea slams shut behind us; above, the vertebra islands are turning, vertebra by vertebra, to face the sail. The lighthouse’s beam is closer now—a scorching white wake cutting channels in air itself. We aim for it, into whatever throat of light swallows ships that outgrow their nightmares.

I grip the railing, salt crusting on my lips, and say the words I never had time for before the dream arrives: “Steady as she goes.”
