You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to wander the neon-lit streets, skyscrapers twisting like impossible spirals into a bruised purple sky. The air hums with distant chatter in languages that shift like smoke—English one moment, then something melodic and alien.

Panic bubbles up, but your feet carry you forward, drawn to a glowing map kiosk pulsing with holographic ads for "Eternal Appointments." You tap it frantically, and it spits out a shimmering card: *Meeting at the Apex Spire, Level 47. Arrive by dreamfold.* No address, just a riddle. A passing crow with human eyes caws, "Follow the river of forgotten clocks!"

You sprint toward a canal where timepieces float like lily pads, ticking backward. Leaping onto one, you ride the current through alleyways where shadows whisper your forgotten secrets. Sirens wail— not police, but flocks of porcelain birds shattering on impact.

The Spire looms, a needle piercing the clouds. An elevator of liquid glass whisks you up, doors opening to a chamber of floating chairs and a figure in a suit made of stars. "You're late," they say, smiling with too many teeth. "But dreams don't keep time."

You sit, the meeting begins—about rewriting reality's code—but as you speak, the city below dissolves into fractals. You wake with the card still clutched in your hand, glowing faintly on your nightstand.
