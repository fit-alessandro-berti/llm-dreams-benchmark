tiny moving gears woven into the surface, almost as if the box itself is alive. The patterns shift when you touch them, rearranging into symbols you can’t quite recognize — yet they feel *familiar*, like half-remembered songs from childhood.

A soft hum begins to emanate from the box, resonating through your fingertips. Without thinking, you start tracing the shifting lines with your finger, and the box reacts, lighting up with a deep, golden glow. Suddenly, a section of the box clicks and slides open just a crack, releasing a whisper of warm, perfumed air.

Inside, you glimpse a swirling mist, and within it, flashes of distant mountains, forgotten cities, and a vast, starry sky — as if the box holds entire worlds folded into its heart. Something stirs in the mist, beckoning you closer, and you realize with a thrill of both fear and excitement:

The box isn’t just a container. It’s a door.

Do you want to step inside?
