…and each round feels like a different kind of gravity.

You stand in a room that smells faintly of orange peels and printer toner. A lanyard hangs around your neck with a name you recognize and a photograph that keeps blinking at you, like it can’t quite keep up. The host’s microphone is a fountain pen. The spotlight is a slow-moving moon. When the buzzer sounds, the floor glides beneath your feet and you’re suddenly at a starting line painted across your childhood backyard.

Round One is called Orientation, though it feels like remembering. Your first task is to build something with nothing but what you know. A box of mismatched parts appears: an old report card, a receipt for a coffee you drank alone but didn’t want to, the map of a city you almost moved to, a postcard you never sent. You have five minutes and no idea what the thing should be. The other contestants assemble aeroplanes and towers. You lay the items out in a careful row and realize they hinge into a small, uncomplicated frame: four corners of a picture you haven’t taken yet. When you hoist it up, the host nods. The frame makes everything inside it look more like itself.

Round Two is the sound of a hundred phones ringing. You’re herded into a labyrinth of cubicles that grow like coral reefs. The carpet hums with fluorescent animals. At each corner a phone blinks, and when you pick up you hear your own voice asking for help from different spans of time. “Ask for a raise,” says one. “Ask for a day,” says another, more tired. “Ask for a different question,” suggests a third. The challenge, says a sign, is to reach the exit before the maze changes its mind. You realize each hallway opens not with speed but with answer. You tell your future voice you don’t know yet, but you’ll stay on the line. Walls soften. You tell your past voice it did the best it could with the information it had. Doors unlock. You tell the present voice to drink some water. A panel slides back to reveal sunlight.

Round Three is a team exercise called Bridge the Gap. Your group is made of people who look familiar in the way strangers do on the subway. One person speaks in blueprints. One person only speaks when someone else stops. The gap spans a shallow pool that reflects not the ceiling but a sky full of migrating resumes. They flap like starlings. There are supplies: index cards, paper clips, three stubborn ideas, and a strong suspicion no one will do it right. The plan fails twice. The third time you notice your own stack of papers is heavier than the others – not with experience, but with the weight you give your own missteps. You slide them into the middle where the bridge is weakest. “It’ll never hold,” someone says. Then it does. The bridge works, not because it is perfect but because you use what you were ashamed of to make the whole thing honest.

Round Four happens in a hallway painted the color of waiting rooms. A laminated card announces an ethics drill. “Keep to the path,” it says. “Proceed without delay. Do not engage.” A person you don’t know is sitting on the floor, crying into their hands, with a bleeding thumb and a pile of dropped documents. You think of points, of clocks, of the stern kindness of rules. You think of the job you want, the way it sits in you like a small electricity. You step out of the painted line and kneel. The act is unglamorous: you offer a napkin, you listen to the shape of their day, you learn they aren’t part of the show at all, that none of you are, not exactly. The scoreboard stutters when you help. Numbers rearrange themselves into a different arithmetic. You fall behind and ahead at the same time. The host whispers into his pen that the audience loves a surprise.

Round Five is an interview on a stage built to look like a kitchen. There are pots simmering with adjectives. The judges sit behind a counter with glasses of water that refill whenever you’re brave. Their faces are masks you recognize: a mentor with your grandmother’s eyes, a professor with your laugh, a stranger with your posture. They ask questions whose answers are not facts but gestures.

“What would you do if you had everything you needed?” one asks.

“Everything except permission,” you say before you can stop yourself. The judges scratch something down and the pots steam a little sweeter.

“What will you bring that we don’t already have?” asks another.

“A clean pocket to carry the thing that breaks your heart,” you say. You don’t know where that came from. The audience leans in like grass.

“What mistake did you make that you would make again?” asks the last.

“Showing up before I knew how,” you say. The stove clicks off. The stage fills with the smell of something finished.

There are smaller trials scattered like coins: writing a mission statement across a moving train; finding your desk in an office where every nameplate is yours, just spelled differently; presenting your work to an audience that keeps changing languages, so you learn to show with your hands. In one scene, a supervisor hands you a plant and tells you to keep it alive without sunlight. You borrow other people’s windows. The plant lives because light is more common than doors.

The semifinals are a test of endurance disguised as a party. Music spills like laughter in a language you almost know. People keep asking what you do, and you answer differently each time: I make rooms braver; I listen to what isn’t being said; I turn messes into maps. Each answer rings true enough to keep the chandelier from crashing to the floor. You dance with a woman whose earrings are tiny clocks, and they stop when you both talk about the time you nearly quit. The confetti is shredded job descriptions.

When it’s time for the finals, the host leads you through a door that looks like an apology. The room is empty except for a chair and a mirror you can sit across from. The mirror is slightly tired of being a mirror. It blurs and sharpens in time with your inhale. There are no judges, no scoring, no audience but your own attention. A voice that is neither inside nor outside asks, “Why this? Why you?”

You want to recite the correct answer. Instead, you tell the story of the first time you saw someone do this job and felt heat gather at the base of your throat. You tell the mirror about the nights you couldn’t stop thinking, about how you carry a small notebook to catch what day leaves behind, about the way your mouth tastes like pennies when you’re scared and how you keep speaking anyway. You confess that you are weary of pretending success is a solitary sport, that you want a team and a window. That you want to be paid, yes, and safe, yes, but also to be useful in a way that makes your ribs feel like doors.

The mirror nods without moving. On the chair beside you is a key you didn’t notice before. It’s warm. It fits only one lock you know: a small one you’ve worn in your chest since long before you could name it. When you turn it, your sternum swings quietly on its hinges and a bird the color of possibility walks out, shakes itself free of dust, and curls in your palm like a thought that finally has room.

Somewhere, the host claps once. “We have a winner,” he says, and his voice comes from everywhere and nowhere. The other contestants appear, not behind you but beside you. They are smiling. You realize the stage has no edge. It’s a field at the edge of a city you love when you think you can’t. The grand prize announces itself not as a spotlight, not as a crown, but as a desk with a view of a sky big enough to confuse with water. The job is yours the way breath is yours: not owned, but ongoing. It doesn’t begin later. It begins when you put the bird back into your chest and it knows how to fly in place.

In the dream you start work immediately. Your first task is the same as your last challenge: to listen until the room tells you what it is. The clock on the wall relaxes. Someone brings a mug that says You did the thing. The door stays open.

When you wake, the lanyard is gone, but you can still feel the weight of the key. In the thin light before you remember the day’s actual shape, you can hear the phones in the maze ringing softly, the ringtone of your own name. You answer. You are hired. You are already here.
