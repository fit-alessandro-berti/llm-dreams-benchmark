...run, but the pavement beneath your feet feels like it's breathing—in and out, a slow syncopation that throws off your rhythm. You check your phone again, but the screen shows only rippling water, the numbers dissolving like ink. The address was here somewhere, you're sure of it. You had it written on the back of your hand, but now your hand is covered in subway maps that keep reorganizing themselves.

You stop a woman in a red coat, but when she turns, her face is a clock with no hands. She points down an alley that wasn't there a moment ago and says, "Follow the sound of the color blue." Her voice echoes from somewhere above, even though her mouth didn't move. You thank her automatically, because dream-etiquette demands it.

The alley narrows until you're sideways-walking through a gap between two glass buildings that reflect you differently in each pane—older, younger, made of birds. You can feel the meeting's importance pulsing in your chest like a second heart, but you can't remember who you're meeting or why. Only the urgency remains, pure and crystalline.

A street sign catches your eye: "TOMORROW PLACE—ETA 60 MINUTES AGO." You look up and the sky is a calendar flipping backwards. You start to run again, but now you're floating just above the sidewalk, and the faster you pump your legs, the more slowly you move. The city exhales, and all the doors slam shut at once.

You realize you've been holding a key the whole time. It's made of smoke, and it's dissolving between your fingers.
