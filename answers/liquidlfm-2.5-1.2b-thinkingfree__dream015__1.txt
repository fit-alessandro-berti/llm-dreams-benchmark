You decide to build a makeshift shelter from scavenged materials, its crude walls offering fleeting respite from the storm’s fury. As rain pattered against its jagged sides, you recall the importance of place to seek salvation—or be saved by it. Outside, shadows writhe like ghosts, but here, amidst the clatter of survival, a fragile certainty lingers: *Perhaps light persists*. The weight of uncertainty still clings, yet for now, the act of creating shelter becomes an act of defiance—a step forward, however small, toward the fragile hope of continuity.
