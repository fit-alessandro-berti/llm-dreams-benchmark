...the puzzles become increasingly abstract and surreal. 

You find yourself standing before a door that has no handle, only a series of glowing symbols that shift and rearrange themselves as you watch. The air hums with a strange frequency, and you realize the symbols aren't just visual - they're mathematical proofs written in a language that somehow you instinctively understand.

As you solve each equation, the door slowly creaks open, revealing not another corridor, but a vast library where the books are made of crystallized light. The puzzles here aren't written - they're musical compositions that you must solve by conducting invisible orchestras with gestures you've never learned but somehow know perfectly.

Deeper still, the maze begins to breathe around you. The walls pulse with your heartbeat, and you realize you're not just solving puzzles - you're unraveling the logic of consciousness itself. Each correct answer makes you more aware, until you can see the dreamer dreaming the dream, and you understand that the final puzzle is simply: wake up.

But which layer of dreaming are you really in?
