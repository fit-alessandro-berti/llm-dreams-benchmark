You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide **to dedicate yourself to preserving the old world's knowledge.** The weight of the past feels heavier than the dust coating your worn boots. Seeing the scraps of technology misunderstood, the stories of the time before lost to scavenging and violence, and the slow decay of understanding itself gnaws at you.

Your decision isn't born of grand idealism, but of quiet defiance against the creeping darkness. You become a **Keeper of Embers.**

Your journey takes you through skeletal skyscrapers choked with ivy, through abandoned libraries where the air hangs thick with the scent of decaying paper and ozone, and through forgotten archives where data flickers weakly on dying screens. You scavenge not just for food or bullets, but for books, schematics, maps, and any fragment of art, science, or history you can carry.

The dangers are manifold: rival scavenger gangs who see your collection as loot, malfunctioning automated defenses left over from the old world, desperate individuals who might burn a book for warmth, and the ever-present threat of radiation sickness or mutant creatures drawn to the ruins.

But the rewards are small, profound victories. You find a cracked tablet holding a child's drawing of a sun. You salvage a water-damaged manual on basic botany. You rescue a box of vinyl records, the crackle of a voice singing a forgotten song echoing strangely in the silence of a ruined auditorium. You meticulously copy recipes onto salvaged parchment, preserving the taste of a lost world.

Your sanctuary is a hidden cellar, reinforced and stocked with precious water and nutrient paste. Here, amidst the dust motes dancing in shafts of light from a broken skylight, you carefully clean, repair, and catalog your finds. You teach eager children the alphabet, not with grand promises, but so they might decipher a street sign or a warning label. You sketch diagrams of simple machines, hoping someone might one day rebuild something more than just shelter.

Your hands are calloused from hauling scavenged materials, but your heart feels strangely full. You are not building armies or empires. You are simply keeping the embers of humanity's past alive, one salvaged page, one remembered melody, one carefully taught word at a time. In a world obsessed with survival, you fight a different battle: the battle against forgetting. And in the quiet hum of your hidden archive, amidst the scent of old paper and faint hope, you find a purpose that makes the barren world feel, somehow, less empty.
