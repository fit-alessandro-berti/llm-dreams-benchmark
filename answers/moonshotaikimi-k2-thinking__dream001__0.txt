You start to pat your pockets for your phone, but your hands feel numb and distant, like they're wrapped in layers of gauze. When you finally grasp it, the screen shows only a swirl of colors that won't resolve into icons. You try to speak into it—*"Call the office"*—but your voice comes out as a series of musical notes that cascade into the street and shatter like glass on the pavement. A pigeon pecks at the shards.

You begin walking. The buildings lean toward you, their windows winking with reflected sunlight that seems to come from underground. Every street sign you pass is written in a language you almost recognize; the letters keep rearranging when you blink. You turn left on what you think is Market Street, but the sign now reads "Mnemosyne Avenue" in wobbly neon. The crosswalk button pulses like a heart beneath your finger.

A bus pulls up, but it's impossibly tall—six stories high—and the doors open vertically like a gaping mouth. The driver has no face, just a smooth oval of skin where features should be. You board anyway, dropping coins that melt into mercury beads that roll down the slanted floor. The bus moves sideways through the city, buildings parting like curtains. You catch a glimpse of your reflection in the window: you're wearing a suit made of old newspapers, headlines about meetings you'll never attend.

You pull the cord to stop, but it's a spider's thread that dissolves. The bus lets you off in a plaza where the fountain flows upward and everyone is walking backward except you. A woman with a briefcase made of smoke tells you the meeting is in the Glass Tower, "just through the revolving door of the red building." She points, but her finger splits into five smaller fingers, each pointing a different direction. You try to follow one and find yourself inside a department store where mannequins are having a conference around a table. One turns its head 180 degrees to look at you. Its eyes are clocks, both showing different times. Neither is correct.

Your watch face has become a mirror, reflecting a younger version of yourself who knows the way. That version mouths words you can't hear. You try to run, but gravity has loosened—the ground ripples like water, and each step sends you floating slightly upward. You grab a lamppost to anchor yourself, but it's warm and soft and breathing. It purrs.

From above, you can see the city is a spiral, unwinding. At the center, a building with infinite floors spins like a top. A paper airplane drifts past you, unfolding into an origami elephant that trumpets directions in binary code. You understand it perfectly: *Take the elevator that only goes down to reach the roof.*

You have seven minutes left. Or seven hours. The sun is setting in the east, and your reflection has already arrived at the meeting without you.
