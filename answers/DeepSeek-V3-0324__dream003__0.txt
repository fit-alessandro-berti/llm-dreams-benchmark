symbols etched into its surface, glowing faintly under the dim light of the dream. The box hums with an otherworldly energy, as if it contains something both ancient and alive.  

Your fingers trace the carvings—strange, swirling runes that seem to shift when you blink. A whisper echoes in your mind, a voice you don’t recognize, murmuring:

> I am unseen yet guide the lost.  
> What am I?"*  

The box trembles slightly, as if waiting for your answer. The air around you grows thick with anticipation. Do you dare respond? And if so—what do you say?  

*(How would you like to proceed?)*
