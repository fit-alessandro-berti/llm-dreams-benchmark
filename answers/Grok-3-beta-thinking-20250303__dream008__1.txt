Here’s a continuation of your dream:

---

You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel the familiar knot of panic tightening in your chest. The office hums with its usual chaos—phones ringing, keyboards clacking—but as you stare at the blank screen, something strange happens. The walls around you begin to shimmer and dissolve, melting away like wax under a flame. Your desk softens beneath your hands, transforming into a lush patch of grass, and the harsh fluorescent lights fade into a warm, golden glow filtering through a canopy of trees.

You blink, and the workplace is gone. You’re standing in a serene forest, the air crisp and alive with the scent of pine. Your boss, the project, the impossible deadline—they’ve vanished, as if they were never real. Time feels different here, fluid and unhurried, like a gentle stream winding through the woods. The weight of stress lifts from your shoulders, replaced by a quiet calm. You take a deep breath, letting the cool air fill your lungs, and realize that maybe this dream is whispering a truth: the pressure you feel doesn’t have to define you.

Curious, you start walking deeper into the forest. The path ahead is dappled with sunlight, and a soft breeze rustles the leaves above. Somewhere in the distance, you hear the faint trickle of water—a promise of more wonders to uncover. You smile, content to explore this dream world, knowing that here, deadlines hold no power, and you’re free to simply be.
