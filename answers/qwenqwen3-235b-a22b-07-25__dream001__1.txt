...panic. The towering buildings around you shift subtly when you’re not looking—bricks ripple like water, street signs flicker between languages, and the sky pulses with a soft, bruised twilight that never seems to deepen into night.

You reach into your pocket—no phone, just a smooth, warm stone engraved with the number *417*. You don’t remember putting it there.

A bicycle messenger in a rain-streaked yellow vest skids to a halt beside you. “You’re late,” they say, not unkindly. “Follow the pigeons.”

Before you can respond, they vanish—bike, vest, and all—leaving behind only a single white feather drifting onto the wet pavement.

You look up. A murmuration of pigeons swirls above the rooftops, forming shapes: first a clock with no hands, then a door, then a path arrow pointing down a narrow alley.

Your legs move on their own. The alley breathes—walls expanding and contracting like lungs. At the end, a brass door appears, unmarked except for a keyhole shaped like a spiral.

The stone in your hand begins to hum. You press it into the keyhole.

It fits.

The door opens not into a room, but onto a quiet hill under a field of stars. On a wooden bench sits your younger self, reading a book titled *The Meeting Was Always Here*.

They look up and smile. “We’ve been waiting,” they say.

And suddenly, you remember: the meeting isn’t late.

It’s *this*.
