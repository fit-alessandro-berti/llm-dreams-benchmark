The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide **to walk away before things get truly ugly.** The silence that crashes between you is heavier than any shouted word. You turn, your back rigid, and stride towards the door of the cramped, unfamiliar room you find yourselves in – a room that seems to shift slightly at the edges, dissolving into swirling grey mist like the edges of a forgotten photograph.

You burst out into a landscape that feels both familiar and utterly alien. It's a twilight cityscape, but the buildings are made of stacked books, their spines glowing with faint, unreadable light. The pavement under your feet is cold, smooth stone that pulses faintly with your heartbeat. Behind you, you can almost feel your friend's presence like a physical ache, a void in the dream-space where they should be. The argument replays in jagged fragments: their voice sharp as broken glass, your own words tangled and insufficient, the core issue – *whatever it was* – looming vast and unresolved between you.

You walk aimlessly through the city of books, the mist curling around your ankles like restless spirits. The silence presses in, thick and suffocating. You try to focus on the glowing spines, hoping for answers, but the titles shift and blur, refusing to resolve into legible words. You feel a profound loneliness, a sense of loss for something precious you might have shattered.

Then, you see it. Ahead, where the path forks, a figure stands bathed in the cool, silver light emanating from the stacked buildings. It's not your friend, but someone else – a figure cloaked in deep indigo robes, their face obscured by shadow, but radiating an ancient, weary calm. They don't speak, simply hold out a single, perfectly smooth river stone, cool to the touch even in the dream's chill.

As you reach out and take it, the stone begins to glow with a soft, warm light – the exact color of your friend's eyes. The moment your fingers close around it, a wave of understanding crashes over you, sharper than the argument had been. You *see* their perspective, not just intellectually, but viscerally – the fear, the love, the deep-seated conviction that fueled their sharp words. You feel the weight of your own defensiveness, the moments you failed to listen fully.

The indigo figure nods once, silently, and dissolves into the mist like smoke. Clutching the warm stone, you turn back the way you came. The path feels different now, less jagged, more defined. The silence has transformed; it's no longer empty, but expectant. You walk towards the glowing book-buildings, towards the unresolved space where your friend's absence echoes.

As you near the doorway you burst through earlier, the mist parts. Your friend stands there, not facing you, but looking out at the city of books. They look smaller, somehow, shoulders hunched. The cold stone in your hand pulses gently.

You take a deep breath, the dream-air filling your lungs. You walk towards them, the river stone held out, not as an offering, but as a bridge – a tangible piece of the understanding you suddenly possess. The mist swirls around your feet, and the distant glow of the book-spines seems to hold its breath, waiting. The argument isn't over, but the space between you has changed, filled with the fragile, luminous possibility of repair, held in the palm of your hand and the silence you now share.
