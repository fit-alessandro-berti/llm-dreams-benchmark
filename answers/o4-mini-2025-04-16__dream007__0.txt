…take a deep breath and lower your voice. You hold up a hand, murmuring, “Wait—before we go any further, I need you to know how much this matters to me.” Your friend’s eyes soften for a moment, but the tension hasn’t left the air.  

Suddenly the room shimmers. The walls of the café around you peel away like old wallpaper, revealing a wide meadow beneath a bruised-purple sky. Wildflowers sway in slow motion; you can feel each petal brush against your skin. Your friend stands just yards away, arms crossed, their face unreadable. You realize the fight you were having has become something larger—this strange world is shaped by your emotions. If your anger flares, storm clouds will gather; if you calm, sunlight will break through.  

You take another breath and decide to apologize first. The single word “I’m sorry” sounds impossibly loud. The meadow brightens, and your friend’s posture relaxes. They step forward, brushing a hand along the petals at your feet, then reach out to touch your shoulder. In that moment you both understand: winning the argument doesn’t matter as much as keeping each other close.  

As you look into their eyes, the purple sky fractures into dawn. A chorus of birdcalls crescendos, and you know your dream is shifting again—back toward waking life. You blink, find yourself on the edge of a familiar bed, and carry with you a warm sense of reconciliation.
