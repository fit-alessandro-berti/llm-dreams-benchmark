queeze your way through the crowd, trying to maintain a sense of direction towards your acquaintance. The room is brightly lit and decorated with festive balloons and streamers, the air filled with the lively chatter and laughter of many voices. People are mingling in clusters, some engaged in conversations, others dancing to the rhythmic music playing in the background.

As you navigate, you accidentally step on someone's toe and quickly apologize, but they merely smile and wave it off, their attention already moved to the next person. You can't help but notice a group of people nearby who seem particularly animated, whispering and gesticulating enthusiastically. You try to catch snippets of their conversation:

"... incredible görünen bu fota!"

"... off the charts!"

"... you had to see it to believe it!"

They are discussing something they just witnessed on a large projection screen placed at the far end of the room. Unable to resist the call of curiosity, you push through the group and approach the screen, which now shows a high-energy video montage. The music reaches a crescendo, and you realize the montage is of a fireworks display, with bright explosions and whistling trails in the sky.

You recognize the fireworks as part of a ceremony commemorating a significant milestone in another person's life—a birthday, maybe, or an anniversary. A man in a suit is speaking into a microphone, addressing the crowd, probably making a speech. Despite the muffled noise of the crowd and the music, you can faintly hear some of what he is saying:

"...We gather here today to celebrate not just one person, but the impact that individual has had on our community..."

Feeling a mixture of excitement and anticipation, you turn to look for the person you know. Just as you do, you spot them over in another corner of the room, laughing and waving at their friends. You smile and wave back, but your friend is already in motion, making their way over to where you are standing. You feel a rush of relief and happiness, knowing you succeeded in your quest to find them.
