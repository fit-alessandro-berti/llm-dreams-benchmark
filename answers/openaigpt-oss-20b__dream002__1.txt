The wind starts to whisper in your ears, a low, lilting hum that seems to come from the trunks themselves. The leaves, once just green blades, now flicker with a silver sheen, shifting like wet glass under an unseen light. You pause, heart thrumming, and notice a path that wasn't there a moment before. It curls through the forest like a silver ribbon, vanishing into a meadow that glows with an impossible violet hue.

The storm doesn't come with thunder or lightning—it arrives with a soft, continuous sigh. The sky above turns a translucent blue, and the clouds drift by as if they were made of liquid moonlight, rippling in gentle waves. It feels less like an incoming tempest and more like a gentle exhalation of the forest itself, breathing deep.

Your feet lead you over moss that gleams faintly under the strange light, each step echoing like a quiet drum in your chest. As you walk, the trees bend slightly, as if bowing in acknowledgment of your presence. From somewhere within the trees, a choir of voices rises—faint, melodic, and the tune. Not voices, but the rustle of the leaves, every word a wordless lyric that you instinctively can sing along to.

Suddenly, the meadow opens up to reveal a small, crystal-clear pond. The surface is glassy, reflecting the shimmering sky but also showing imagery as if looking into another realm—a swirl of colors, shapes, perhaps memories folded into this space. You reach out, and your fingertips touch something that feels like cold stone but dissolves into a warm, luminous mist that lingers in the air.

Before you can fully take a breath, a wind grows—soft yet alive, full of fragrant whispers. It brings on the scent of rain, but not the earthy scent you might expect. This scent is of pomegranate, of jasmine, of something like the first time you finished reading a book you loved. It makes the air taste sweet and sharp at the same time, dissolving any sense of dread that the storm might have prodded.

From somewhere above, a single feather drifts down to hover by your shoulder—a feather that is a mix of twilight blue and dawn gold. The feather begins to pulse—tiny beats, like a mini heartbeat, each beat resonating with the stone pond below, echoing into the forest. Suddenly the storm becomes a pulse of the entire ecosystem: the trees, the pond, even the smallest inch of moss lining your path—all a living rhythm, vibrating in tune with the feather's pulse.

You feel roots, roots of the forest reaching down from the soil, gently adjusting your feet as if steering you through a hidden course. The forest seems to say, “It is not a storm, it is the heart of us all.” The brightness of the violet meadow slightly dims as the storm's presence grows, but the veins of the pellet glow like heartbeats. The deeper you move into the meadow, the more you sense that the storm is an intertwined lullaby, a promise of nourishment, a transformation rather than a threat.

You close your eyes for a heartbeat. In that darkness, you feel each feather, the pond, the wind, the tree's whisper, all wrapped into one inevitable, cyclical dance. When you open your eyes again, the storm fades to a horizon of light, its altered palette turning the forest into a dreamscape where it is the storm that greets you, not the one that frightens. Every tremor is a note in a symphony, and you are no longer in a forest but in a living, breathing poem.
