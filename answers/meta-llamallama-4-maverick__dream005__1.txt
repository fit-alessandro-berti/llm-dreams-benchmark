you start to feel a growing sense of anxiety and disorientation. You're scanning the room, your eyes searching for a familiar face, but everyone seems to be a stranger. You spot a group of people laughing and chatting, and you try to join in, but they barely acknowledge your presence. You awkwardly stand there for a moment, trying to think of something to say, before moving on.

As you weave through the crowd, you start to notice that the music is getting louder and the lighting is becoming more and more surreal. The colors are pulsing and swirling, making it hard to focus on any one thing. You feel a hand on your arm, and you spin around, hoping it's the one person you know, but it's just a stranger offering you a drink.

You take the drink, more out of politeness than anything else, and as you raise it to your lips, you catch a glimpse of a figure across the room that makes your heart skip a beat. It's the person you're looking for! You try to push your way through the crowd towards them, but it's like trying to wade through quicksand. The more you struggle, the more stuck you become.

Just as you're starting to feel like you're going to be trapped forever, the scene around you begins to distort and blur. The music reaches a crescendo, and the lights start to strobe wildly. You feel yourself being pulled towards the figure, and you stumble forward, the drink flying out of your hand...

And then, just as suddenly as it started, everything goes black. You're left standing in a dark, silent space, the only sound the echo of your own ragged breathing. You're not sure what's real and what's part of the dream anymore. But as you stand there, trying to catch your breath, you hear a faint whisper in your ear... "I'm right behind you."
