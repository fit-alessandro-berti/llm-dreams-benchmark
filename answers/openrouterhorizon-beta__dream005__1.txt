you notice everyone is wearing slightly mismatched shoes. Some have one sneaker and one velvet slipper; others have a boot paired with a ballet flat. You feel certain there’s a pattern to it, like a code you ought to be able to read if only you tilt your head the right way.

You weave through pockets of conversation. A circle of people whispering about the weather are all drenched from the knees down, though the carpet is dry. A trio discussing books hold their novels backward, titles on the inside. A woman laughs and a handful of confetti falls from her mouth, catching in the plants. Every time you think you’ve spotted your friend’s profile, the person turns into someone else: a second cousin from a family reunion that never happened, an old teacher whose name you’ve forgotten, a barista you used to see every Thursday.

You try calling your friend, but your phone vibrates like a hummingbird and shows you a map of the room with a single blinking dot that keeps slipping behind a column labeled “Later.” The music doesn’t seem to come from speakers so much as the ceiling itself, a low chorus of distant kettles, or maybe cicadas. The air smells sharply of oranges, then of rain on hot pavement, then of the drawer where your childhood crayons lived. You are certain you could find them by smell, if the crowd would only hold still.

A man with a clipboard asks your name as if you’ve forgotten it. You give it to him, and he writes it down and then hands it back to you on a sticker that says “Hello, I Am Looking For Someone.” You stick it to your chest and feel it warm up, pulsing slightly like a small animal. A child tugs your sleeve and tells you the punch is actually soup if you believe in it. You look into the bowl: alphabet letters drift past, but they are all the letter of your friend’s initials, looping and knocking against the rim with soft clinks.

You pass a coat rack forest where garments sway as if breathing. As you brush past, the sleeves reach for you, friendly, grateful, a bit desperate. A coat with a fur collar murmurs that you just missed them, try the balcony. On the balcony, the night is an aquarium. The city lights below glide like fish behind glass; your reflection is layered over the scene, and for a moment you see your friend standing where you are, but wearing your expression. You wave to them, and your hand lags a fraction behind.

Back inside, a group is gathered around a table of keys. So many keys: brass and silver, rusted and new, some shaped like question marks, one that looks exactly like a tooth. When you pick up the tooth-key it’s warm and aches faintly in your palm. “Trade something?” someone suggests, and you set down your loneliness for a moment—it sits there like an old coin—and take the key with you.

You find a hallway that was not there before, papered with maps of places that almost existed. At the end of it is a door that should not be a door—it is the exact shade of your friend’s favorite sweater. The tooth-key fits. It clicks with a sound that feels like biting into an apple.

The room beyond is quiet, lit with lamp-light the color of tea. Your friend is there, or at least the idea of them is. They are turned away, rearranging photographs on a wall. Some of the photos are of you and them; others are of rooms that could hold you both; some are of hands setting a table, two sets of utensils always laid out, even when no one is hungry. You call their name and they turn, and for a beat their face is yours and yours is theirs, and there’s an understanding like catching your balance on a moving train.

“I was just putting these in order,” they say, and you realize the order is the one you’ve been trying to read all night: mismatched shoes, wet hems, backward books, confetti laughter, those initials in the soup. They take your sticker and press it under a magnet shaped like a small moon. “You found me,” they say, and it’s not a question. You want to tell them you followed the scent of oranges and rainy sidewalks, but the words dissolve pleasantly, like sugar.

Together you step back into the gathering, which is now a garden. The conversations bloom. The shoes match suddenly, but they are not on feet; they hang from branches like fruit, swaying. Someone begins to dance and the floor rises and falls like a gentle sea. You and your friend move through it, and it moves through you, and for a while there is no search, only the feeling that you were both always going to arrive right here, right now, as if all the mismatched moments were just a lane leading you home.
