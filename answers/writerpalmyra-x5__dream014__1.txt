...accept their offer, heart swelling with relief. They don’t just point you in a direction—they walk with you, chatting like old friends, their voices blending with the city’s rhythm. One laughs, and the sound sparks a memory: *this* isn’t the first time you’ve been lost here. You’ve wandered these streets in other dreams, always near this same neon-lit fountain, always just before dawn.  

As you turn a corner, the tallest stranger gestures ahead — “Your stop is right there” — and you see a small train station with a sign that flickers between *Home* and your childhood nickname. The sky is softening to indigo.  

But then, a song starts — one you don’t recognize, yet your body sways to it. The strangers begin to fade slightly, like film burning at the edges, still smiling. One whispers, “You always find us when you need to.”  

Do you board the train… or step back toward them?
