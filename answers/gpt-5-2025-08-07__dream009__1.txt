You wake to the sound of wind moving through reeds instead of the mucus hum of traffic and lights. The sky is bigger, unstitched by wires. The air wears the smell of smoke, river water and animal. Your hands come up out of habit, searching your pockets for a rectangle that isn't there. No glow. No time. The morning is a gray-blue bowl tipped carefully over a low hill and a cluster of roofs you don’t recognize—thatch like sleeping hair, walls woven of sticks and mud.

You walk. Your feet learn the feel of unmapped ground: the give of damp earth, the spring of turf. Your mind keeps tossing questions forward to see which one trips and falls into an answer. What year? What continent? Who speaks your name here?

There is no sign. There is a dog that watches you, head tilted, then decides you are not a threat or not a meal and goes back to being a dog. There are women with their hair bound up, their hands busy with baskets and wet reeds, a boy with a chipped tooth who tracks you from the shade of a doorway. The language in the air is a lattice of vowels you can't place. Laughter, a call, a willow branch dipped in a bucket.

You are aware, suddenly and with a clarity that feels like cold water, that you keep scanning for an outlet—somewhere to charge what has already been taken. So you realize you need to stop looking for a socket and start looking for a hearth. You realize you need to belong, and belonging here is not a password but an exchange.

Someone hands you bread. It is heavy and sour and tastes like patience. Someone else offers a skin of water that tastes faintly of smoke. You point to yourself and say your name and they offer you a word that might be "stranger" or might be "guest" depending on where the stress falls and what the eyes are doing. Both are fine. Both are true.

You point, mime, laugh, fail, try again. You learn, in a morning, that most of your life has been listening with your eyes closed. Here, the currency is attention. What you can give is not electricity or a bit rate, but a way to take your turn.

A woman with a fox-fur collar and a scar like a deliberate line from lip to chin takes your wrist. She holds it, not like she owns it, but like she's measuring your pulse for truth. She brings you to a little circle of stone and sits you beside a boy who is weaving something that looks like a mistake and will likely become a basket. The old woman speaks into a small silence. Her mouth makes an O of question and then a smaller O inside it, which you somehow understand to mean: Give us a true thing.

You search yourself. True things you know without your tools: the names of a few constellations, how to find north if you can find the sun. The lever and the fulcrum. The recipe for a simple bread if you can catch some wild yeast out of the air and feed it time. The way to coil a rope that will not snag when you need it. Your grandmother's way of telling whether the weather will change by watching how ants behave. How to make soap out of ash and fat. How to anger a goose and why not to.

You draw a circle in the dirt and set a stick up on edge. The old woman laughs—kindly, but sharp. Sunflower, her tongue says, and then eats shadow. You wait with them while the shadow moves. When the stick points to a line you scratched in the soil that you guessed at earlier, the boy whistles through his tooth and everyone is very politely unimpressed. A day is a day in any language. You feel foolish and relieved. The world doesn't need saving; it needs you to learn its names.

So you watch. The wind changes. From the curving track of the river, fog lifts itself by its own hair. Someone calls the geese with a reed whistle and they lower like punctuation. Children move past you in precise chaos, the kind that keeps everyone alive. A man comes in with a net over his shoulder like a second skin. He brushes ash from his forearms and says something that sounds like "Who picks you up when you fall way far from where your feet live?"

You spread your hands. You try to shape with your mouth the thing you understand now: You are not here to fix or to dazzle or to prove, but you are also not nothing. You are a bank of small useful knowledge and some useless glittering stories. You are very good at carrying a question without laying it down in the wrong place.

They decide to send you to the river. Not far. They tie a little clay bell to your belt and tell you to bring back the sound the water makes when it hits the root of the old willow. This is how they test your ears. This is how they see who you are when no one is rehearsing. You stand at the willow. The water says many things, all at once; it has had a lot of practice. You cup your hands. You collect a smooth stone and the way light breaks on the bend. You hold it in your mouth, that particular syllable the river keeps squeezing out between its teeth—thrr. You carry it home, the stone cool in your palm, the sound ringing in your throat. When you empty your hands into the old woman's hands, she tips her head, hears the river come back out of your mouth and nods once. Enough.

Days happen. Or they are all the same day, made of different arrangements of attention. You learn the long path to the spring. The path learns your feet. You barter two songs for a cloak because night is colder here, or because night is longer. You learn to pare willow, to twist it, to fail and fail until it becomes a basket without your permission. You tell them a story you remember from a book written long after their bones will be dust, and in exchange a man tells you how the swans mean war if they leave early. You say, too quickly, that swans are mostly symbolic, and he gives you a look like, Let us have the dignity of our own metaphors.

Sometimes, when everyone sleeps, you walk to where the land rises and becomes thought. There are stones there that make a circle—the kind of place people make to speak to their dead and to the version of the sun that listens. You press your palm to granite. You tell the stone who you were: the coffee you drank out of paper cups, the light you wore as a helmet in bed at night, the soft blue square that told you news of people you'll never touch. The stone tells you nothing or tells you everything in stone's voice, which is not a voice but a span.

On a day that could be the first or the last, you find yourself watching a kiln being stoked. Heat like a throat. Sand in a low bowl reddening to amber, then white. Their glass is not glass, not yet, but there is the thought of it. You stare into that light and it stares back and you see, for a shutter of a heartbeat, your old window—the dusty top rail, the smear where a moth went to die a noiseless death. You feel the pull, ridiculous and real as gravity, toward your own absence.

You realize then, as the old woman walks behind you and sets a hand on your shoulder to keep you from falling into a heat that wants to turn you into idea, that you have one more true thing to give. It is small. It does not shine. You turn and tell them the story of how you woke up not knowing the names for anything and how you learned to ask without having something to trade but yourself. You tell them the word you have carried all your life but never examined: home. You let it sit between you on the ground like an egg, unhatched and enough.

When the geese rise that evening, they make a sound like a zipper closing the day. The boy with the chipped tooth taps the clay bell on your belt and the sound it makes is the sound your alarm clock used to make, only changed into clay. Everyone laughs at your face. You laugh too. You cry a little into your laughter because the world is like that.

You lie down under a new old sky, belly full of stew that tastes of root and salt and smoke, head full of names that used to be the names of other things. The old woman says a word that is either a blessing or a map. You close your eyes and the river goes on saying itself, and your body is finally the right size.

In the morning you wake and the outlets are back, blue light in every corner, emails like gnats. You miss the heft of the bread. You can still make the little river sound between your teeth. You go to your kitchen. You light a match. You hold your palm over the flame and listen for the shadow eating its way across the counter. You think, quietly and on purpose, about who you can be useful to with only what you remember. You don't tell anyone about the bell that sometimes rings at your hip when there is no bell there. You go on, belonging a little more and in a different direction.
