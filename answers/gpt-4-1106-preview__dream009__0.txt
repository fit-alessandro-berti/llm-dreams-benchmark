adapt quickly to survive. You find yourself in what appears to be a medieval village, with thatched-roof cottages and dirt paths. The air is filled with the distant sound of clanging metal, which you gather must be coming from the blacksmith’s forge, and there's the scent of woodsmoke and roasting meat on the breeze.

You make your way towards the heart of the village, where people are bustling about, some eyeing you with curiosity due to your unfamiliar attire. A mix of peasants, merchants, and knights in various stages of armor pass by. You hear snippets of old dialects, and you realize you can understand them, as if the dream has granted you the knowledge of the language.

In order to blend in and not draw too much attention, you decide to find some period-appropriate clothes. Spotting a marketplace, you search through various stalls until you find a clothing vendor. Using a few silver coins you surprisingly find in your pocket, you trade for a modest tunic and a pair of breeches.

Now properly dressed, you realize you need to find a place to stay and a way to sustain yourself. You overhear talk of a nearby farm that needs extra hands for the harvest. Deciding that this might be a good place to start, you offer your help to the farmer in exchange for food and lodging. Gratefully, the farmer agrees, and you spend the next few weeks learning the rhythm of this simpler, but physically demanding life.

Nights are filled with tales and song by the hearth, and you find yourself enjoying this dream-version of history despite the initial shock. One day, while working in the fields, you come across a curious amulet buried in the soil. As you touch it, the dream begins to shift—you sense a change in the air, a swirling of colors and sound, as if the amulet has triggered a transition to yet another dream...

And then, you wake up for real, amulet clutched in your hand, with the morning sun streaming through the window and the familiar hum of modern life waiting outside your door.
