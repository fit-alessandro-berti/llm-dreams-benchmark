…hesitate for a moment, unsure whether to trust them. But something in their eyes—warm, sincere, aglow with quiet understanding—pulls you toward them. So you accept.

They lead you down winding alleys painted with whispers of old stories, past street musicians whose songs seem to float through your chest like memories you never lived. One of them, an old woman with silver hair braided with threads of gold, presses a delicate stone into your palm. “For guidance,” she says, as if she already knows what you seek.

The city begins to shift strangely around you. Skyscrapers bend gently like trees swaying in a breeze. Traffic lights blink in time with your heartbeat. You no longer feel lost, though you still don’t know the destination. The strangers walk beside you in silence, as if they’re listening closely to something you can’t quite hear.

Finally, you arrive at a quiet courtyard hidden between the folds of the city, where lanterns float mid-air and a fountain hums a melody that feels like an old lullaby. The group motions for you to step forward alone.

As you approach the center of the courtyard, the stone in your palm begins to glow. A doorway shimmers into existence—shaped like the outline of a dream you once had but never remembered. You look back at your new friends, who smile and slowly fade into mist.

You take a deep breath. And step through.
