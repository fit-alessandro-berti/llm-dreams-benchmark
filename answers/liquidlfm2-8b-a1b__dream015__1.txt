The wind howls through broken skyscrapers, carrying the ash of nameless summers. To your left, the fence is half-buried in the earth—rust stains pooling like old blood—while to your right, a flickering flame dances beside a faded icon: a green triangle, half-decimated, once promising safety, now just a ghost.  

You breathe in the dry air, fingertips raw, eyes scanning the crumbling landscape. Scavenging for food, your boots scrape over shattered glass and forgotten toys—quiet memories in a world that forgot how to hope. The sky is a slow-motion gray, the sun half-hidden behind layers of ash, casting everything in a sickly, paper-thin light.  

But today, something shifts.  

You find a trail ofاة—small, deliberate—winding through the rubble. Not of criminals, nor bandits, but others like you: scavengers, maybe, but something deeper. A purpose.  

And you remember—last month, before everything collapsed, a voice whispered across the radio: *“We’re not just surviving. We’re rebuilding.”*  

This trail leads toward a half-submerged library, overgrown with ivy but still standing. Rumors say the old world’s digital archives survived. Not data, but blueprints—architecture, medicine, agriculture. If real, it could be the start.  

Carefully, you step forward.  

Dreams are the only things left that still feel like possibility.  

And you are ready to carry them.
