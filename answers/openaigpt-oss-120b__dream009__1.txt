You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need **to understand how to survive**—and perhaps find a way back.

The air smells of pine and damp earth, tinged with the faint scent of smoke drifting from a distant hearth. The sky is a deep, unfiltered blue, and the sun hangs lower than you’re used to, casting long, honey‑colored shadows across a landscape that feels both wild and intimate. Around you, low, thatched structures cluster together, their walls made of wattle and clay. Children dart between them, their laughter ringing like wind chimes.

You stand at the edge of a narrow cobblestone lane, the stones uneven and worn by. A market stalls nearby, its canvas awnings flapping in a gentle breeze. Merchants call out in a language that is familiar enough to you to grasp a few words—“grain,” “fabric,” “metal”—but the cadence and accents are foreign, a reminder that you are far from home.

A gaunt man with a weather‑worn face pauses beside you, his eyes sharp behind a braid of silver hair. He bends down, offering a wooden bowl filled with dark, steaming broth. “Eat,” he says in a curt, but not unkind voice. You accept, feeling the warmth seep through your hand, and the broth you in the moment.

Your mind races. You have no phone compass, no map—only the senses that have served humans for millennia. You need to figure out three things:

1. **Shelter** – A safe place to rest and protect yourself from the elements.
2. **** – Reliable sources that won’t run out in a few days.
3. **Information** – How to navigate this world, perhaps discover a path back to the time you know.

You decide to explore systematically, starting with the market. The stalls are a riot of colors: bundles of wheat, baskets of berries, woven baskets of tools, and a small stall where a woman is polishing a set of copper rings. She watches you with a mix of curiosity and caution.

“Stranger,” she says, her voice soft but firm, “you look lost. Are you a traveller from the hills?” You shake your head; there is no simple answer that would fit the question. Still, you gesture, trying to convey that you need help.

She smiles, perhaps amused, perhaps empathetic, and gestures toward a narrow alley lined with hanging herbs—lavender, sage, rosemary. “Follow that path,” she says, “and you’ll find the inn at the far end. The innkeeper, Master Alden, will give you a room for the night. He’s a good man and will share what he knows about these lands.”

You thank her, feeling a strange sense of relief. The alley is cool, the herbs releasing a faint perfume that lulls your nerves. As you walk, you notice the ground beneath your feet gradually giving way to a soft moss, damp from a nearby brook you can hear murmuring.

The brook becomes visible—a ribbon of clear water slipping between smooth river stones. You kneel, cupping the cool water in your hands, feeling its icy clarity. It’s fresh, promising enough to quench your thirst. You fill the wooden bowl the gaunt man gave you and take a sip, grateful for the simple miracle of drinkable water.

Upstream, you spot a fallen log that serves as a natural bridge. Crossing it, you find yourself on a small rise that offers a view of the valley beyond. In the distance, smoke rises from what looks like a larger settlement, perhaps a town surrounded by fields and forest. The sun is beginning its slow descent, painting everything in amber.

Following the path mandated by the woman’s instructions, you soon arrive at a modest stone building with a sign that reads “The Hearthstone Inn.” The wooden doors swing open as you approach, and a warm glow spills out, accompanied by the sound of crackling fire and low voices.

Inside, the inn is bustling but welcoming. Rough-hewn tables are occupied by locals sharing food and stories. A young barmaid rushes past, her apron smudged with flour, and heads toward the hearth where a large pot simmers. At the far end, a man in a sturdy coat sits behind a roughly carved desk, his eyes sharp but kind.

You approach him. “Good evening,” you say, trying to sound respectful. “I’m… a traveler seeking shelter and perhaps direction.”

He studies you for a moment, then nods. “I am Alden, keeper of this inn. You look weary. Take a seat. I’ll fetch you a loaf and some cheese. While you eat, you can tell me what you need to know.”

You sit on a sturdy wooden bench, the seat creaking under your weight. The innkeeper brings a thick slice of sourdough bread, a wedge of sharp cheese, and a small cup of honeyed ale. The flavor is simple, unadorned, yet somehow richer than any modern fare you’ve ever tasted.

As you eat, Alden leans forward, his brow furrowing. “You asked about… there’s a river north of here, called the Moonwater. It runs through the old forest and out beyond the mountains. Folks say that beyond the mountains lies a place ‘out of time,’ a valley where the world seems different.” He pauses, gauging your reaction. “Many have sought it. Few have returned. But if you’re determined, you might find a guide.”

He slides a rough-sketch map across the table. The parchment is stained with ink and tea, the lines crude but sufficient. A red X marks a location deep within the forest, labeled “Elder’s Grove.” Beneath it, in smaller script, reads: “Seek the knows the way.”

You study the map. The path to the Elder’s Grove is a winding trail that skirts the river you just drank from, climbs a ridge dotted with ancient oaks, and then descends into a misty thicket. The journey will be long and fraught with unknowns, but it offers a chance—not just for survival, but for purpose.

You thank Aldan, accept the map, and decide to rest for the night. That evening, as the fire crackles and the inn fills with soft songs, you lie on a straw mattress, the weight of the world—and the weight of time—pressing gently against you. In the dark, the only sound is the sighing wind through the trees outside, a reminder that the world is vast and full of mysteries.

The next morning, after a hearty breakfast of porridge and fresh berries, you rise with a renewed resolve. You have shelter (the inn), food and water (the market and the brook), and now a thread of information—a possible path back to the world you once knew, or perhaps a new one entirely.

You step outside, the sun now high and bright, and set your feet upon the path that leads toward the Elder’s Grove. The adventure has just begun, and every step forward is a step deeper into the dream you now live. The wind carries a faint whisper, almost as if the land itself is saying:

*“Travel on, dream‑walker. The world will reveal what you need if you dare to look.”*
