…accept their help, following them through winding streets lit with the warm glow of lanterns. You pass towering apartment blocks adorned with neon signs and strange symbols you cannot read, their windows like watchful eyes. As you move through the crowd, you notice that the people around you speak in low, musical tones, their voices rising and falling in gentle harmonies. Though you can’t understand the language, their kindness is evident in their gestures—the way they lean in to guide you, the soft smiles that pass between them.

With each turn, the city’s noise recedes into a distant hum. You cross a footbridge over a narrow canal of shimmering water that reflects fragments of starlight. The strangers pause here. One of them, a tall figure draped in a dark cloak, points toward a cluster of elegant towers in the distance. Their silhouettes are sharp against a silvered sky. You feel a gentle pressure on your shoulder as another of the strangers—this one wearing a scarf embroidered with delicate birds—tilts their head, as if encouraging you onward.

When you step off the bridge, the tempo of the city changes. The bustle softens into a quiet rhythm of footsteps and hushed conversation. There is a sense of being guided not merely to a place but toward an understanding. The air is scented with something like cinnamon and night-blooming flowers. You follow your guides into a narrow alley lit by paper lanterns. The light is soft and welcoming, revealing murals of tall ships and endless oceans painted across the old brick walls. It’s as if these images have been placed here for you—reminders that the world outside this city is vast and beautiful.

At the alley’s end, a circular courtyard opens up. In the center stands a stone fountain carved with images of mythic creatures. The strangers gather around you, forming a loose circle. One steps forward and places in your hand a small compass with a glowing needle. You realize it points not north or south, but to something else—perhaps the direction of home, or to the person you must become.

When you lift your eyes, the strangers have begun to fade, each becoming translucent in the lantern light. Yet, their kindness remains with you, comforting and warm. The distant hum of the city returns, but now it carries with it a gentle certainty. You know which way to go, and you take the first step, feeling no longer lost, but guided by the memory of their quiet voices, their gentle smiles, and the promise of finding your way at last.
