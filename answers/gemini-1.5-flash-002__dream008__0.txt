...and you feel a cold dread crawl up your spine.  The project brief, a single sheet of paper printed on impossibly thick, almost parchment-like stock, details the creation of a miniature, fully functional replica of the Eiffel Tower, constructed entirely of sharpened pencils.  The deadline?  Sunrise tomorrow.

Panic threatens to overwhelm you, but a strange calm settles in its place.  You glance around the office – normally a sterile environment of cubicles and humming computers, it’s now filled with a swirling, iridescent mist that smells faintly of cinnamon and old books.  Your colleagues, instead of their usual attire, wear brightly colored, mismatched clown costumes, silently juggling flaming torches.

Instead of freaking out, you find yourself strangely invigorated.  You grab a handful of pencils from the supply closet (they’re somehow incredibly long and incredibly sharp, almost impossibly so), and with a newfound clarity, begin to sketch intricate blueprints on the back of the impossibly thick project brief. The mist swirls around you, offering glimpses of miniature Eiffel Towers, perfectly formed, each pencil meticulously placed.  The juggling clowns continue their silent performance, their movements hypnotic and oddly inspiring.

You work through the night, the impossible deadline suddenly feeling less impossible. The pencils seem to sculpt themselves, guided by an unseen hand. The mist provides a soft, ethereal glow, illuminating your work with an otherworldly luminescence. As the first rays of dawn creep through the window, the miniature Eiffel Tower stands complete, a testament to the absurd and the beautiful, a masterpiece born of a dream's impossible demand. Your boss, now wearing a top hat and a monocle, approaches, not with criticism, but with a slow, appreciative clap. The clowns bow deeply.  You wake up.
