in a language you don't understand. Panic begins to set in as you flip through the pages, your heart racing. The symbols on the pages are like nothing you've ever seen, a mix of hieroglyphics and mathematical equations that seem to dance before your eyes. You look around the room and everyone else is writing calmly, as if everything is normal. Desperate, you raise your hand to get the instructor's attention.

The instructor walks over, their face morphing as they move—a blur of features that keep changing, never settling on a single recognizable person. You try to explain the problem, but when you open your mouth, no sound comes out. Suddenly, the instructor hands you a pair of glasses. Hesitantly, you put them on, and the once alien script on the exam transforms into questions you understand, but now the clock is ticking louder, each tick echoing through the room.

You start to write, your hand moving furiously across the page, but the ink from the pen begins to turn to water, dripping and blurring the words you've written. Frustration mounts as you try to rewrite your answers, but the water keeps flowing, and the paper disintegrates under the deluge.

You look to the clock, and the hands are spinning uncontrollably. Time is running out, but just as despair is about to take over, the bell rings, signaling the end of the exam. However, as you look down, you find your paper perfectly written and complete. The water and the strange language are gone as if they were never there.

The instructor, now with a steady face, collects your exam and gives you a knowing smile. On your way out, you glance back at the classroom—it has transformed into a vast, open field under a bright blue sky. The other students are there, but they are now distant figures fading into the horizon.

Your heart, once pounding with fear, begins to calm as you realize you were dreaming—dreaming within a dream. And as you walk through the meadow, the dream gently fades, and you wake up, the remnants of the surreal test quickly evaporating from your memory, leaving behind a feeling of relief and the faint impression of an unfathomable classroom where your future was once an unsolvable riddle.
