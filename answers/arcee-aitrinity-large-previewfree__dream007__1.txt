You propose meeting later to discuss the issue calmly and rationally, emphasizing the importance of maintaining your friendship despite the disagreement. You both agree to take some time apart to reflect on the situation and come back with a clearer perspective. As you part ways, you feel a mix of frustration and hope that you can resolve the conflict and strengthen your bond.
