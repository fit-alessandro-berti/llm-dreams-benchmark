We ride like a thought through a skull. Lightning peels the black cloth and sears the horizon; rain drives horizontal. The crew looks to you, eyes wide, hands white where they grip, voices hoarse but steady. You take the helm, the wood warm and slick under your palm. The wheel groans, the ship rises, swings on the belly of a wave, and drops into a hollow that feels endless.

You shout: “All! Topsails square; hold your lines true!” The cutter’s voice answers, the tiniest pitch brave enough to cut through thunder: “Aye!” The gaskets slam, the blocks sing, and the deck quivers as if the sea is cracking its jaw.

You breathe once for all of them. The yaw unwinds—upright—then leans again. The compass card spins, and you follow it not with your eyes but with your bone-deep sense of steady. You feel the mast sway like the spine of the storm. Two buoys sweep in and out of the wave crests, red and white, red and white, something like a heartbeat, or like a last lighthouse before the world ends.

The wind shifts again. You read it like a hand on your forearm, hair rising. “Belay the jib; set storm staysail low,” you call. Ropes sing, crew moves like a flock of sea birds diving into the face of the tide, sure because you told them not where, but that it was time.

Stars are gone, the sky a thrown shawl. Salt stings your tongue. A bolt splits the masthead—wood cracks, like a gunshot—and you feel the deck roll under the weight of it. The carpenter wedges the boom, the cook is a second helper to whoever needs him, the dogs stare at you from the companionway as if you are the only dry weather left.

You look past the white combers for that last remembered light, not as a promise but as a way to navigate between the lies the storm whispers: Come into us, we will fold you; down, down. You look for the horizon line where rain and ocean touch. It holds steady. The hull thrums the sea’s word, an old language you’ve known since birth.

The sea tests you with a cliff of water. You lean into it, steer into it, and when the ship crests and you feel her rise like a horse you’ve trained since it was a foal, you let out the breath you’ve held for the whole world and begin the long pull toward the lee, out of the wind’s eye, a wisp of steadier air. Behind you, lightning tries to turn the night into a photograph of your face. You ignore it.

Somewhere inside you, that quiet lighthouse flickers on. Not because you know, but because you choose. And because your choice holds, the crew calms. You hear one voice to windward say, “He’s got it,” and for a moment you think you don’t have to be right; you only have to be steady.

You don’t promise safety. You promise direction: “We will hold together; we will not be scattered.” Your hands find the wood, the wheel, the line’s texture under your fingers—your eyes find the horizon that refuses to sink—your voice finds a pitch that doesn’t fight the storm but rides it.
