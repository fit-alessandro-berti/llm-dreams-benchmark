You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. The air thickens, as if the sky itself were taking a deep breath. A low, tremulous hum rolls through the trees, and the birds fall quiet as if listening to a rumor nobody can quite catch. The first raindrop strikes your cheek and feels almost ceremonial, a quiet echo of a storm growing just beyond the edge of sight. Then the sky opens in a sudden, electric blue, and lightning writes quick, bright sigils across the clouds. The wind shifts, no longer a breeze but a door slamming open—the forest rearranging itself to meet the storm halfway.

The rain begins as a few brave pins of water and quickly swells into a chorus of downpour. Each drop glances off leaves with a tiny starflash, as though the forest wears a thousand miniature suns on its skin. The path you walked a moment ago is gone, replaced by a mirror-water stream that glides between mossy stones. You step onto the slick stones and the world tilts just enough to remind you that you’re in a dream, the kind of dream where gravity forgets its rules but your breath remains real. You laugh softly at the absurd seriousness of weather, and the rain answers in a rhythm that sounds almost like music—an orchestra of drips, gusts, and the distant thunder that keeps time.

In the center of the storm’s growl, a figure emerges not from the trees but from the rain itself. It is a stag, but not merely a stag: its antlers braid with ribbons of light, each branch a slender corridor that glows with a pale, inward fire. Its eyes are the color of old amber and carry the patient light of a lighthouse keeper. The stag steps out onto the stream and the water pauses as if listening to a performance, all the noises of the forest tuning themselves to its presence. It speaks not with a mouth but with a soft rustle of leaves, and your name, your memories, your hopes echo back to you in the same rustle.

“Storms are not here to scatter you,” the stag seems to tell you, “but to sift you, to test what you carry and what you can let go.” The rain sifts down in sheets that break into thousands of tiny mirrors, each reflecting a piece of your past—moments of certainty you once held, fears you thought you’d outgrown, promises you meant to keep but forgot to. You watch them float past like fragile boats on a lake of wind. Some you reach for; others drift away if you only blink.

The stag lowers its head toward a patch of ground where the rain-fed stream has carved a shallow pool, a surface of glass that holds a perfect little sky—clouds, a moon that isn’t there, the shimmer of stars that shouldn’t be visible in daylight. “If you wish to move forward,” the stag says, its voice a gentle stamping of rain on stone, “you must choose what you want this storm to carry and what you want it to drop.” You feel the weight of this choice—an almost-childlike sense that you could decide differently than your waking mind ever would.

You step closer to the pool and look into it. The reflection is not merely your image but a gathering of every version of you you have ever been, all blinking at once: the you who rushed, the you who waited, the you who whispered, the you who shouted. The storm answers with a bright crack of lightning that paints the pool with a thousand separate, shimmering me-s. You realize the dream is offering you a doorway: you can take any one of these selves across the threshold, or you can fold them together into something new.

“Show me where to go,” you finally tell the stag, feeling a quiet courage rise up in the hollow of your chest. The stag stamps once, and the forest tilts again, not with fear but with invitation. The rain clears from your ears and you hear a distant, sing-song voice—the voice of the forest itself—saying, This is not a place to fear the change, but a place to welcome what you wish to become.

With that, the storm ceases to be a storm and becomes a current of light that threads through the trees. The world brightens in the way a lens brightens when you twist it toward a pleasant thought. The stag steps back, and from the light blooms a doorway of rain-washed air, a narrow arch that glows like the inside of a seashell. You walk. Your steps are sure, as if someone else had learned your footing for you and handed you the map you always carried but forgot to unfold.

Beyond the doorway, the forest is the same yet different: trees taller and more patient, roots like small rivers beneath your feet, air sweeter with the taste of rain and pine and something newly found. The storm’s edge lingers not as a threat but as a guide, pointing you toward a clearing where the world feels newly yours. In the center sits a quiet pool that reflects not just your image but the calm you are beginning to feel inside—like a memory of a place you’ve never been, suddenly known.

Then the rain eases, the wind softens, and the dream settles into a peaceful hush that feels almost like a breath held in anticipation of waking. You step from the doorway and back into the forest’s ordinary beauty, though everything looks slightly brushed with the color of possibility. The storm has given you a question and a gift: a clarity you choose to carry into the waking world, a sense that you can walk through change with grace, that the storm you once feared was simply the doorway into becoming who you were always meant to be. The dream fades in the moment before dawn, leaving you with the feeling that the forest and you are finally precisely in the same story—and you wake, still walking, in the warmth of a new morning.
