…the tasks grow stranger by the round.

Round 1 – The Silence Test  
You enter an amphitheater filled with judges, but when you try to speak no sound leaves your mouth. A glowing prompt hovers overhead: “Tell us who you are without words.”  
You improvise—stacking nearby props into a living sculpture that shows the arc of your life: a toy microscope for childhood curiosity, a cracked coffee mug for late‑night study sessions, and a paper crane to symbolize hope. The judges nod; a scoreboard flickers 1 – 0 in your favor.

Round 2 – The Shifting Hallway  
You must reach a door at the far end of a corridor whose floor tiles rearrange themselves every three steps. Memories of past failures flash on the walls, trying to distract you. You feel panic rising until you remember advice from a mentor: “Keep your eyes on where you want to be, not on where you’ve been.” You run, eyes fixed on the door. The corridor still mutates, but your path remains straight. You slam the handle—another point lights up.

Round 3 – The Question That Isn’t a Question  
In a candle‑lit library, an ancient interviewer asks, “What is the one answer you will never give?” You start listing possibilities—until you realize the correct response is silence. You grin, let the moment hang, and the candles flare green in approval.

Round 4 – Colleagues of Clay  
You’re given a table of clay figures and told to “build the perfect team.” Competitors sculpt flawless replicas of themselves, but you shape mismatched, complementary miniatures: a tall thinker, a meticulous organizer, a spirited risk‑taker. When the whistle blows, your figures fuse into a single, balanced form. The others crumble.

Round 5 – The Mirror Stage  
You step onto a darkened platform surrounded by mirrors that replay your worst self‑talk at full volume. To advance, you must speak a truer narrative. You face each reflection and counter every insult—“unqualified,” “too late,” “not enough”—with earned evidence of your growth. One by one the mirrors turn to windows overlooking sunrise.

Final Round – The Leap  
At the summit of a spiral tower stands a floating ring of light: the “Offer.” No stairs lead to it, only empty air. A scoreboard shows a tie with the last remaining contestant. The judges announce, “The job goes to whoever reaches the ring first.” Your rival begins calculating rope lengths and wind speeds. You close your eyes, remember every challenge so far—the voiceless introduction, the moving floor, the silent answer, the composite team, the re‑voiced mirrors—and recognize the pattern: progress was never about force but about trust in purpose.  
You breathe, step off the edge, and the air solidifies beneath your feet like invisible glass. Three calm strides carry you through the ring.

Trumpets blast. Confetti made of résumé pages flutters down. The judges shake your hand and declare, “Welcome to your dream job—you’ve been doing it all along.”

You wake to morning light, heart pounding, a notebook beside your bed. On its open page are the words you scribbled before sleep: Trust the path, speak without fear, build with others, rewrite the mirror, and leap. You smile, because even though the dream is over, the interview next week suddenly feels a lot less scary.
