...written in a language that I somehow recognize but cannot speak. It looks like ancient geometry mixed with handwriting from my childhood. As I squint at the first line, the letters begin to unstick themselves from the paper and float into the air, rearranging themselves into a question that isn't written in words, but in a sudden, overwhelming smell of my grandmother's house.

I look at the second question, which asks me to calculate the exact weight of a specific regret I've been carrying for ten years. I reach for my pen, but my hand has turned into a bouquet of wilted tulips. I look up at the clock to see how much time is left, but instead of numbers, the clock face is just an eye that blinks slowly at me. Around the room, the other students are scribbling furiously with feathers that emit smoke, their heads detached from their bodies and hovering slightly above their desks.

The professor, who is now a giant, floating key wearing a tweed jacket, announces that time is up, and I realize I haven't written a single thing. I try to scream, but only bubbles come out.
