# The Dream Continues...

...written in a language you don't recognize.

You flip through the pages frantically. Page after page of symbols, swirling characters, and diagrams that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them. Your heart races.

Then something strange happens—you realize you *do* understand them. Not with your eyes, but somehow... you just *know* what they mean. It's like the knowledge is already inside you, waiting.

You pick up your pen to start writing, and suddenly you're not in a classroom anymore. You're standing in a vast library where the walls are made of flowing water. Your professor walks by—except they're also your childhood best friend, and also somehow a figure made of light.

\'t worry,\ say with a smile. \ exam was never about the answers. It was about whether you'd keep reading.\ pages in front of you are now blank. You could write anything. You could draw anything. You could leave them empty.

What do you do?
