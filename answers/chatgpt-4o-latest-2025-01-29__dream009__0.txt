adapt quickly to this unfamiliar world. The air smells different, tinged with wood smoke and earth, and the clothes on your body are coarse and handmade. Judging by the architecture and the people’s attire, you’ve landed in what seems to be the medieval era. 

Panic rises in your chest, but you force yourself to stay calm. You’ll need food, shelter, and a way to blend in—standing out could be dangerous. The last thing you want is to be mistaken for a sorcerer or an outsider with ill intentions. 

As you wander through the narrow, cobbled streets, a group of people huddle around a noisy market. Vendors shout about fresh bread, cured meats, and fabrics. Your stomach growls—when was the last time you ate? You reach into your pockets, but of course, there's no modern money. Just as you’re about to leave, a hooded figure catches your eye. They tilt their head, as if studying you. 

Then, in a hushed voice, they say, **"You're not from here, are you?"** 

Your heart pounds. Do you run? Deny it? Or follow the stranger into the unknown?
