…and you hesitate, just for a moment.

They’re smiling, though—soft, unhurried smiles that don’t feel like the city’s noise. One of them has a map folded so many times the creases look like rivers; another is holding a takeaway coffee cup with your favorite drink, somehow, even though you never said a word.

“Rough day?” one of them asks.

You nod before you even know you’re nodding.

They don’t ask where you’re going right away. Instead, they fall into step around you like a loose, gentle orbit, guiding you away from the busiest street. The sounds of car horns and chatter stretch out and blur, turning into something more like the ocean than traffic.

“Tell us where you thought you were headed,” someone says. “Not the address. The… feeling of it.”

You frown, but answer anyway, because in dreams you don’t question how strange the questions are.

“Somewhere quiet,” you say. “Somewhere I feel like I belong. Like I’m not in the way.”

They all exchange a knowing look, as if that was the exact answer they were expecting.

“Good,” says the one with the map. “That’s easier to find than a street name.”

You turn a corner together. The skyscrapers lean back a little, giving the sky more room. Neon signs dim into warm window lights. The pavement under your feet changes—from cracked concrete to smooth stone, from stone to soft cobblestones that don’t echo your footsteps quite so loudly.

As you walk, they start pointing things out:

“See that balcony?” one says. “The plants are overgrown, but someone waters them every morning.”

“That café?” another adds. “They remember people’s orders but never call them out loud. They just bring you what feels right that day.”

“That park bench,” a third whispers. “It’s always empty right when you need it.”

You hadn’t noticed any of these details before. It’s like the city is subtly rearranging itself, peeling back a layer to show you the hidden version that was always there.

“Is this real?” you ask.

“Does it matter?” the one with the coffee replies. “You’re here. That’s what counts.”

Eventually, you arrive at a small square you’re sure didn’t exist a moment ago. There’s a fountain in the middle, but instead of water, it’s filled with tiny reflections—little images of moments when you felt safe, seen, or understood. A childhood bedroom. A late-night conversation. The first time someone laughed at your joke like they really got it.

You kneel beside it, watching the scenes ripple and rearrange.

“I don’t know this place,” you say quietly.

One of the strangers sits beside you. “You do. It’s made of everywhere you’ve felt like you almost belonged, but left too soon.”

You look up at them. “Then why am I here now?”

“Because you finally asked for help,” they answer simply. “Even if it was only inside your own head.”

There’s a long pause. The city around you hums, but gently now, like a lullaby instead of a demand.

“What if I get lost again?” you ask.

The stranger with the map folds it once more and hands it to you. When you open it, it’s blank—no streets, no labels, just a faint outline of your own hand.

“You probably will,” they say. “Everyone does. But now you know: you’re allowed to stop and let people walk with you. You’re allowed to not have every turn memorized.”

Another adds, “And you’re allowed to make wrong turns. Sometimes that’s where the soft places are hiding.”

You feel something ease in your chest, like a knot loosening. The loneliness that had been pressing in from all sides feels less like a wall and more like a fog lifting, revealing paths you couldn’t see before.

“Will I see you again?” you ask.

They smile, stepping back toward the edges of the square.

“We never really left,” one says. “Think of us as the part of you that still believes you can find your way. Whenever you’re lost, we’re the strangers you haven’t met yet, the kindness you haven’t expected, the help you’re finally willing to accept.”

You blink—and the square is empty.

The fountain is just water now, catching glints of city light. The strangers are gone, or maybe they’ve become the crowd again: unfamiliar faces with the potential to become something more, given time, given courage.

You look down at your hands. The map is still there, blank and warm and light.

Without quite knowing how you’ve decided, you pick a street and start walking—not because you’re sure it’s the right way, but because you’re no longer terrified of being wrong.

As you move through the city, the noise feels different. Less like chaos, more like a language you might one day understand.

That’s when you realize: you don’t feel quite so lost anymore.

And in that moment of quiet certainty, you begin to wake up.
