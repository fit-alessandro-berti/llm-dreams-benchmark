…each group splits into two versions of themselves—one side flickering like an old film, speaking in reversed whispers, the other completely still, smiling with eyes too wide and glassy. I recognize the still ones as people from my childhood, impossibly preserved, mouthing words I almost remember. My chest tightens. I duck behind a pillar that wasn’t there a second ago, its surface carved with my handwriting from decades ago, sentences I don’t recall writing: *“You left the door open. They’ve been waiting.”*

A hand touches my shoulder—warm, grounding. It’s you. You’re holding two glasses of something amber, smiling like we’ve just shared a joke. But your reflection in the dark window behind you isn’t smiling. It’s mouthing, *“Which one of us is dreaming?”*

Do you hand me a glass… or do you suddenly look afraid?
