adapt quickly to survive. The air smells different—earthier, with a faint hint of wood smoke. You find yourself in what appears to be a bustling medieval village. Thatched-roof cottages line the dirt streets, and people in simple tunics and cloaks hustle about, carrying baskets of bread, leather goods, and vegetables. A distant bell tolls, and you see a grand stone castle looming over the village from a nearby hill.

As you take a step forward, a young boy runs by and nearly collides with you. "Watch it, stranger!" he says, glaring for a moment before scampering off. Looking down, you realize you’re dressed in strange patchwork clothing that seems utterly out of place even in this setting. You clutch your pockets, but there’s nothing modern in them—no phone, no keys. Just a tarnished coin and what looks like a tattered map or piece of parchment.

Curious, you unfold the map. It’s covered in cryptic symbols and markings, but one thing catches your attention: the word *sanctuary*, paired with what looks like an "X" near a towering forest in the distance. Before you can think further, a stern-looking woman with a basket of herbs approaches you. “You there, are you a traveler? You shouldn’t be wandering alone. The King's Watch doesn’t take kindly to—” She looks around and suddenly lowers her voice. “You aren’t from here, are you? If you value your life, meet me at dusk by the old mill.”

Without giving you a chance to respond, she hurries off. You barely have time to process her cryptic warning when a trumpet blares from the castle. A group of heavily armored guards spills into the village square, their eyes scanning the crowd. "By order of the King, all strangers must present themselves!" one of them shouts. The villagers scatter, avoiding the guards' gazes. A few of them glance nervously in your direction before hurrying away.

You have a choice to make. Do you approach the guards and try to explain your situation, or do you hide and wait until dusk to meet the mysterious woman? Either way, it feels as though this strange place has plans for you—plans written in the cryptic map in your hands. 

What will you do next?
