the once quiet forest comes alive with the sound of rustling leaves and creaking trees. The sky turns dark as a cloud of black birds erupts from the canopy overhead, their cawing cries filling the air with a sense of danger.

You quicken your pace, the soft trills of your old hiking boots echoing among the trees. You reach an old wooden bridge, crossing a deep, tumultuous river. The planks underfoot creak ominously, echoing the distant thunder in the grey sky.

On the other side of the bridge is a cabin, looking lost and forlorn under the menacing clouds. As you rush towards it seeking shelter, the heavens open and rain pours down, your clothes soaked in an instant. The wind roars, bending the trees at impossible angles while the forest turns into a sea of green and brown swirls.

The cabin proves to be a haven from the wild weather. As you push the door open, it groans in resistance but finally gives way, revealing a cozy interior. A fire flickers in an old stone fireplace, casting dancing shadows across the room filled with rustic furniture.

As you shed your wet outerwear and seek the inviting warmth of the fire, a conversation seems to carry from the room upstairs. You freeze, realizing you might not be alone. A feeling of fear and curiosity mixes in your gut as you slowly creep up the staircase, unsure who, or what, you might find.
  
Arriving on top, you see a room filled with old maps and astral instruments. The conversation you heard was just a faint radio static that gradually fades away, leaving only the relentless lashing of the rain against the window. You breathe a sigh of relief at being alone and find solace in the mystery of this secluded sanctuary in the middle of a raging storm.

As the rain and storm continues outside, you enjoy the quiet solitude of the cabin, discovering its hidden treasures and secrets. The dream seems to stretch into days and nights, but then slowly it shimmers and fades, returning you to the calmness of your own bed and the silent darkness of very early morning.
