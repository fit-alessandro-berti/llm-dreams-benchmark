You are dreaming. Can you complete the following dream?

**The Dream Continues:**

...look down at your hands, but they're made of static. Like an old television screen, your fingers flicker between solid and noise. You try to speak, but your voice comes out as a fax machine screech.

Your boss sighs. "We need the Q3 report. And also, it's due yesterday. Also, the office is now underwater. Also, you're a penguin."

You look down. You are, indeed, a penguin. The water is warm and smells vaguely of Earl Grey tea. Your coworkers swim past in business suits, goggling at you with disapproval.

You waddle toward your desk—which is somehow also a iceberg—and open your laptop. The screen displays a single message:

**ERROR: REALITY NOT FOUND**

Somewhere, a clock laughs at you.

Your boss crosses his flippers. "I'm going to need that by the time the elevator reaches the 87th floor. Which is also the ocean. Which is also your mother's kitchen."

You begin typing with your flippers. The keys make the sound of distant thunder.

This is fine. Everything is fine.

*Do you want to keep dreaming?* 🐧🏢
