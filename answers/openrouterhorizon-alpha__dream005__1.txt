you realize their conversations are all slightly out of sync with the room, like echoes arriving before the voices. A man in a velvet jacket tells a joke and his punchline blooms a second too early, and everyone laughs on cue as if cued by an invisible conductor. You move through a thicket of coats and perfume, a forest of unfamiliar shoulders, into a circle of people debating a city that doesn’t exist. They’re comparing the quality of its sunsets. One woman swears the shadows are heavier there. Another says the buses hum in a key that makes her teeth ache. They pause to include you and hand you an empty glass the shape of a bell, insisting it’s full of something rare, and when you raise it to your mouth you can taste a childhood you can’t place, sugared and distant.

You keep searching. Your friend is always in the next room or just outside on the balcony or in the kitchen with the good light. Everyone you ask knows their name, says they’ve just missed them, points toward a door you haven’t tried. The doors are always ajar, breathing cool air, and beyond each is another room with a different season. A hallway with winter carpeting that softens your steps. A conservatory where late spring is held under glass, the plants listening to a piano with no pianist. A little library where the books are alphabetized by smell.

In a dining room lit by chandeliers that drip like icicles, you pass a group clustered around a map that keeps changing. They argue about whether it’s a coastline or a weather system, whether the blue is water or a word for water written so densely it becomes sea. Someone draws a circle and says “Here is where we are,” and someone else says “We are a little to the left of here,” and they’re both right.

A waiter asks for your coat, but you aren’t wearing one. He smiles and takes a memory instead, folds it carefully, slides it over his arm. It’s the memory of your friend’s laugh, and you try to protest, but the laugh is already in the cloakroom with the other warm things, and he gives you a claim ticket printed with a few notes of a song you almost recognize. You tuck it into your pocket and feel the music humming against your thigh.

You follow the music. In the next room, people are slow-dancing to a melody that only appears at the edges of your hearing. Faces blur as they turn. Someone steps close and says your name the way you like it said, curved and soft. For a moment you think you’ve found them, but it’s a stranger with your friend’s eyes. “They went to watch the staircase,” the stranger says, and leads you by the hand toward a grand stair that loops like a ribbon through the air.

The staircase is its own party. People lean on the banister and watch as steps appear beneath their feet just before they place them down, so that climbing feels like writing in a language that invents itself. You look up and glimpse your friend’s shoes a flight above, pausing as if waiting for you. You call out, but the sound takes the long way around, comes back as a different word in your mouth, something like “home.”

Halfway up, a group sits in the middle of the steps playing a game with invisible cards. They hold their hands to their chests, nod gravely, lay down nothing and say “King,” “River,” “Apology.” You squeeze past and they make a lane for you, touching your sleeve as if for luck. One of them whispers, “Ask them what the rooms want,” and you nod like this is obvious, because in the dream it is.

You reach a landing with a window the size of a wall. Beyond it is the ocean, lapping quietly at the glass. A child presses their ear to the pane and insists they can hear the sea counting. You do too: one wave is a door, two waves a name, three waves the sound of a match being struck. Your friend appears in the reflection beside you, smiling. You turn and no one is there. You look back at the glass and now it’s a mirror, and your friend is standing next to your reflection, both of you wearing each other’s expressions. “You’re late,” they say without moving their mouth, and the mirror fogs as if whispering a secret.

Down the hall, someone is telling a story so slowly that all the pauses become rooms. People are going in and out of the story, bringing back snacks. You slip in on a comma and find yourself in a kitchen that smells like oranges and rain. Your friend’s laugh is there, hanging from a hook like a ladle. You take it down and it fits your hand. When you laugh into it, the room fills with warm water up to the ankles, and everyone applauds politely as if this is the trick you came to perform.

You wade to the back door. There is always a back door in dreams when you remember to look for one. Outside, the lawn is lit with a kind of night that sounds like summer. Fireflies are writing small bright corrections in the air. Your friend stands at the edge of a hedge maze that wasn’t there a moment ago. They’re holding your coat—no, your memory—and offering it back. “I kept it for you,” they say, “so you wouldn’t forget to look.”

You put the memory on, and it warms your shoulders. Suddenly the maze doesn’t seem like a maze. It’s just a path that turns, and at each turn there is a version of you who tried a different conversation, laughed at the wrong time, looked away. They nod at you gently as you pass. Your friend walks beside you without touching, as if the space between your arms is a fragile instrument you are both afraid to drop.

At the center, there is a small table with two cups of tea that steam in different languages. You choose one that smells like first snow and they choose one that smells like old paper. You sit. The party hums at a distance like a hive remembering. “I thought I’d lost you,” you say.

They shrug and smile the way they do when they are about to tell a truth in a joking voice. “I was always in the room you weren’t ready to enter,” they say. “But look, you kept coming. Look how many doors you made.”

When you wake, you will not remember the words. You will only recall the feeling of choosing a door and finding a season, of climbing a staircase that met you step by step, of a laugh reclaimed warm from a hook. For now, in the dream, the tea cools perfectly and the echo catches up to the voice, and when you and your friend raise your cups, the clink is exactly on time. Somewhere in the house, the music finally resolves into the song printed on the claim ticket, and you both hum along without needing to know the words. The night holds the note for you, as if it were saving your place.
