You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and—*boom*—the sky splits open. The sun vanishes, replaced by a swirling vortex of indigo and gold, as if the heavens themselves are unraveling. The trees, once whispering in harmony, now bend unnaturally, their branches clawing at the air like desperate hands. A low hum vibrates through the earth, and the wind carries voices—not human, but ancient, layered, as though the forest is remembering something it was never meant to forget.  

You stumble forward, rain falling in thick, silver threads that don’t soak your clothes but instead *glow*, illuminating the path ahead. The storm isn’t just weather—it’s a living thing, pulsing with a rhythm that matches your heartbeat. Then, through the downpour, you see it: a door. Not a real one, but a rift in the air, framed by two towering oaks whose trunks have fused into a single, spiraling column. The door is made of light, flickering between a thousand images—your childhood, a stranger’s face, a city that doesn’t exist.  

As you reach out, the storm pauses. The hum fades. A single drop of rain falls, but it doesn’t hit the ground. It hovers, suspended, and inside it, you see *yourself*—but older, with eyes that hold the weight of a thousand storms. The door creaks open, and the voice of the forest speaks, not in words but in a sensation: *“You were never lost. You were just waiting to remember.”*  

The world blurs. The forest dissolves into stars. And then—  

You wake up, breathless, the taste of ozone on your tongue, and the faint echo of a melody you’ve never heard but somehow *know*.
