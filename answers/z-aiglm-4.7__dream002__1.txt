the air instantly grows heavy and electric, tasting of ozone and salt. You look up to see the blue sky bruise rapidly into a deep, swirling violet, and the clouds begin to move with unnatural speed, swirling like water draining from a bathtub.

The wind picks up, but it doesn't just blow; it breathes. A low, resonant hum vibrates in your chest, and you realize the trees aren't just swaying—they are bowing, their branches stretching downward as if trying to touch the earth. You try to run, but the ground beneath you feels soft, like a mattress, and with every step, you sink deeper, slowing your progress until you are wading through the moss and dirt.

Suddenly, the rain begins to fall, but it isn't water. It’s heavy, warm droplets that glow with a faint, neon blue light. Where they hit the forest floor, small mushrooms instantly sprout and bloom, pulsing with the same rhythm as the thunder—which sounds not like a crash, but like a deep, melancholic cello note.

You scramble toward a massive oak tree for shelter, but just as you reach it, the tree splits open like a set of heavy curtains. You stumble inside, expecting wood, but find yourself standing in a grand, candlelit ballroom. The storm outside is silenced instantly, replaced by the soft sound of a waltz. You look down and realize you are wearing a tuxedo made of black feathers. A figure approaches you from the shadows of the ballroom to ask for a dance, but just as they extend a hand, you wake up.
