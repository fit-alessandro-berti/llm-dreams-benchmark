You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea, the wind howling through bent masts and the sky churning with sheets of rain and lightning splitting the dark. The horizon is swallowed by a vortex of gray clouds, and the waves rise like mountains—crashing and retreating with a sudden fury. Your coat is soaked, your boots caked with salt and sea spray, but your voice remains steady as it cuts through the storm’s chaos.  

You grip the worn wooden helm, the grain digging into your palms, eyes scanning the cramped bridge. The crew stands fixed behind you—hands trembling on controls, faces hidden behind soaked wraps—waiting. Beneath the storm, you feel a quiet presence, not of fear, but of resolve. You breathe slow, deliberate, recalling the commanding calm taught by years at sea.  

“Hold fast!” you shout, voice commanding yet kind. “We ride this storm like the sea itself—untamed, but navigable.” Your voice carries above the howl, steady and sure. “Stay sharp. Shift ballast, tighten the rigging, and keep our sails ready for the shift—this one’s not ending soon.”  

The bridge creaks under pressure, but you stay there, guidance in your stance and certainty in your words. Somewhere behind the storm’s roar, a faint signal glints in the rain: a flare from the distant stretch of horizon, a promise that calm may yet return. You glance at the navigation board, fingers tracing the route like a prayer.  

You are the captain. The sea roars. You do not panic. You lead. And tomorrow—  

You see it through the storm.  

…will come.
