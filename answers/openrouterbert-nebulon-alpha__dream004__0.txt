Ah, the dream unfolds like liquid light—

The blank canvas before you isn’t empty at all. It *breathes*. Its surface ripples like water, then hardens into a mirror, reflecting not your face but a version of you made of shifting hues: your eyes are galaxies, your hair strands of molten gold that cool into silver, then bloom into vines heavy with fruit that hums when plucked. The canvas *wants* something. It pulses, impatient.

You reach out—your fingers dissolve into brushstrokes the moment they touch it. The first mark you make isn’t a line, but a *sound*: a deep, resonant chord that vibrates through the air, bending the colors around you. The sky, which was a swirl of indigo and rose, now fractures into stained-glass fragments that rearrange themselves into a city of floating towers, each one a different instrument. A violin-shaped spire plays itself in the wind. A drum-bridge thrums under invisible footsteps.

A figure steps out of the canvas. It’s you, but not you—taller, woven from the same shifting colors as the world, its edges bleeding into the landscape. It smiles, and its teeth are tiny, perfect keys. *"You’re late,"* it says, voice layered like a choir. *"The dream was waiting for you to decide what it’s about."*

Behind it, the canvas has become a doorway. Through it, you see glimpses of other dreams: a library where books rewrite themselves as you read, a forest where the trees grow upside-down from a sky of roots, a train that runs on memories instead of tracks. The figure extends a hand—its palm is a clock with no hands, just a face that spins like a top. *"Pick,"* it urges. *"Or the dream will pick for you."*

And then—

The colors *scream*. The world tilts, and suddenly you’re falling *into* the canvas, but it’s not a fall—it’s a *dive*, like plunging into a pool of liquid time. The shapes around you stretch and snap back: a river of ink becomes a dragon, then a question mark, then a bridge made of laughter. The figure is still there, but now it’s holding a paintbrush the size of a sword, and it’s *offering it to you*.

*"What do you make of this?"* it asks, and the question isn’t just words—it’s a challenge, a dare, a blank page.

Do you—
- **Take the brush and paint a door back to the waking world?** (But what if the door leads somewhere else entirely?)
- **Ask the figure to show you the "rules" of this dream?** (But what if the rules are written in a language of shadows?)
- **Step through the canvas doorway into one of the other dreams?** (But which one? And will you ever find your way back?)
- **Or do something else entirely?** (The dream is yours, after all.)

The canvas hums, waiting. The colors hold their breath. What do you do?
