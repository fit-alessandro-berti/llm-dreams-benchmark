pause for a moment and take a step back from the debate. You recognize that emotions are running high on both sides and understand it's crucial to return to a place where clear communication can be achieved.

Firstly, you suggest taking a break from the argument - perhaps suggesting stepping away momentarily or even agreeing to reconvene later at a set time when tempers might have cooled down. This would give both parties space to reflect on what has been said and also gather their thoughts more objectively without an avalanche of emotions clouding judgment.

Next, propose setting some ground rules for how discussions will resume—these may include taking turns speaking without interruptions or using “I” statements (like saying "In my view," versus accusatory language) which allows each person to express themselves fully while also reducing defensiveness from the other side. Express willingness to hear them out completely before presenting any counter arguments yourself.

You suggest focusing on common goals instead of differences—bringing attention back onto why you value this friendship in general might provide context that helps smooth over current tensions with more understanding and empathy rather than conflict driven by misunderstandings or egos clashing unnecessarily . You could mention all shared experiences which were positive contributing factors towards mutual respect among friends – making clear how much more there is to treasure about each other beyond disagreements pertaining only specific issues at hand .

Finally offer an sincere apology if needed acknowledging any personal mistakes made during the argument—remembering everyone makes errors including oneself—and showing readiness open-mindedly embrace differing viewpoints through honest feedback without taking things personally becomes key towards sustaining harmony within relations over long run effectively strengthening bonds between individuals involved overall!
