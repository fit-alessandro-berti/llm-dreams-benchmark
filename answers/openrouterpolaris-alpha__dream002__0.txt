you look up to see the sky folding in on itself, like pages of a book being turned too quickly.

The air thickens. The leaves on the trees turn their faces upward, as if listening. A low, distant rumble rolls through the woods—not thunder, but something slower, heavier, like a giant taking a breath.

Wind rises without warning.

It doesn’t rush past you; it circles. It curls around your ankles and climbs you like curious hands. The path you were following blurs at the edges, the soil softening into something darker, richer, almost ink-like. The scent of rain arrives sharp and metallic, but the first drop that hits your arm is warm, and when you glance down you see it isn’t water at all—it’s a tiny, perfect, glass-clear marble. It soaks into your skin without a trace.

The trees begin to lean, not away from the coming storm but toward it, trunks bending with impossible grace. Leaves spin off their branches and hang in the air, suspended, forming a slow-moving halo around you. The sky cracks—not with lightning, but with light: clean, white lines spiderwebbing across a now-deep violet dome.

The rumble resolves into a voice, enormous and intimate all at once, speaking in a language you don’t recognize and somehow fully understand: a language made of feelings instead of words.

You are not in danger.

You are being called.

The storm arrives, but it doesn’t break over the forest. It blossoms from the center of your chest.

Wind bursts outward in perfect silence, and every tree bends back as if bowing. The violet sky peels away to reveal another sky behind it, an ocean of slow-turning galaxies pouring soft color into the world. Rain that is not rain begins to fall: tiny glowing shapes—letters, numbers, symbols you’ve never seen—drifting down through the branches and melting wherever they land.

One lands on your palm and sinks in. You feel it unlock something.

The path is gone now, replaced by a narrow ribbon of pale light stretching forward between the trees. It pulses in time with your heartbeat.

You understand, with the effortless clarity only dreams allow, that if you follow this light, you’ll remember something you’ve been trying to tell yourself for a very long time.

Behind you, the peaceful forest waits, unchanged, a safe place you could return to.

Ahead, the storm within you hums like a question, patient and full of possibility.

You take a breath that tastes like rain and starlight, and you step onto the ribbon of light as the trees lean in to listen.
