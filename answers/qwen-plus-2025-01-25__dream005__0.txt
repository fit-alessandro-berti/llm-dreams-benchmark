strange, surreal situations that blur the lines between reality and imagination. The room is vast, with high ceilings and flickering lights that cast long shadows on the walls. Each group of people seems to be engaged in their own peculiar activities, as if they exist in separate worlds within this single space.

First, you pass by a circle of individuals who are all holding up identical golden pocket watches. They seem entranced, staring intently at the ticking hands without speaking. You pause for a moment, curious, but something about their stillness makes you uneasy, so you continue onward.

Next, you encounter a cluster of people dressed in elaborate bird costumes—feathers of every color shimmering under the dim light. They're having what appears to be an intense debate about migration patterns, gesturing wildly with wings outstretched. One of them notices you watching and invites you to join, but just as you open your mouth to respond, another group catches your attention.

Further ahead, there's a table laden with food, though none of it looks edible. Plates overflow with glowing jelly-like substances, floating orbs that emit soft hums, and dishes made entirely of glass that clink together when moved. A woman wearing gloves made of liquid silver serves portions to anyone willing to try. Despite your hunger, you decide it’s best not to sample anything.

As you weave through these odd enclaves, you finally spot the person you know—a friend from childhood whom you haven’t seen in years. But when you call out to them, they don’t turn around. Instead, they seem absorbed in conversation with someone who isn’t there, gesturing toward an empty chair as if it were occupied. Their voice carries faintly across the room, speaking words you can almost—but not quite—understand.

Confused and growing anxious, you reach out to touch their shoulder, only to find that they dissolve into a cascade of tiny sparks before your eyes. Startled, you spin around, searching for answers, but now everyone in the room has turned to face you. Their faces are blank, featureless masks, yet somehow you feel they're studying you intently.

A low murmur rises from the crowd, swelling into a chorus of whispers that echo endlessly in your ears. Among the cacophony, you think you hear your name being called—not by the familiar voice of your friend, but by something older, deeper, more ancient. 

Suddenly, the ground beneath you begins to shift. The floor transforms into water, then ice, then air itself, carrying you upward into the vast expanse above. The gathering fades below, replaced by stars stretching infinitely in all directions. And though you’re weightless, adrift in the cosmos, you feel oddly calm, as though this was always meant to happen.

The dream ends with a single thought forming clearly in your mind: *You’ve only just begun.*
