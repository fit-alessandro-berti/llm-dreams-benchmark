...sit frozen at your desk, fingers hovering over the keyboard. The project brief glows on your screen—*“Deliver the entire redesign of the company’s AI infrastructure by end of day.”* It’s 9:03 a.m. You haven’t even had coffee.

Your boss stands just behind you, posture rigid, eyes unblinking. The clock ticks louder with every second. You try to type, but your fingers press keys that produce only static—like typing into fog. Then, the monitor flickers. Words dissolve into swirling glyphs that rearrange themselves into a single sentence:

**“What if the deadline isn’t the problem… but the key?”**

You glance back. Your boss is gone. In their place stands a version of yourself—calmer, wearing glasses you don’t own, holding a steaming mug that smells like rain and old books.

“Start with what’s already done,” they say softly. “You just forgot you’d already begun.”

You look down. Your hands are moving on their own, lines of elegant code flowing onto the screen—code you’ve never seen, yet somehow remember writing in another life. The impossible deadline isn’t a threat… it’s a doorway.

Outside the window, the sky turns indigo at noon.  
And you finally take a sip of coffee that tastes like possibility.
