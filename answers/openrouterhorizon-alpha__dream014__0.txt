…hesitate, expecting the usual transactional smile, the practiced courtesy. But their faces are softened by something warmer than obligation. One of them—a woman with a scarf printed in tiny constellations—asks where you’re headed, and the answer dissolves like sugar in tea. You don’t know. You only know the ache under your ribs, the way the streetnames tilt away if you look too hard.

“Then let’s just start,” says a man with ink-stained fingers, and the group fans around you, a gentle current in the city’s tide. The map on your phone flickers to a blank white, but no one seems worried. The constellations on the woman’s scarf begin to glow faintly, as if remembering their job. She lifts a corner and the lights rearrange, forming streets that don’t exist and yet feel familiar, the way a song you’ve never heard can make you cry.

You walk.

You pass a bakery that smells like your grandmother’s kitchen, even though you never saw her bake. The baker looks up and nods at you the way people nod when they recognize family they can’t place. A boy at a bus stop is teaching his dog to sit using a poem instead of a command, and the dog listens, cocking its head at the rhyme. A statue of a horse steps off its pedestal and returns when a pigeon scolds it back. The ink-fingered man strides beside you, pockets of his coat blooming with fountain pens like a garden of tiny telescopes.

“Home,” you say suddenly, surprising yourself. “I’m trying to find home.”

“Which one?” asks a woman whose earrings are tiny windows reflecting rooms you haven’t lived in yet.

Before you can answer, you pass a thrift shop with a crooked sign and a bell that rings like a heartbeat. Inside, the kind strangers and you drift past racks of other people’s yesterdays. A coat sleeve brushes your hand and you feel a winter that never happened: your breath a cloud, mittens with snow caught in their weave, a key in a lock that sticks until it doesn’t.

“That one’s not yours,” the constellation-scarf woman says softly. “But it could be, if you wanted.”

You don’t. You keep moving. In the mirror near the register, your reflection is accompanied by a faint second shadow, a little out of sync. You wave; it waves a fraction late, then catches up. The shopkeeper slides a bowl of oranges across the counter. “Vitamin C is for courage,” they say. You take one and tuck it into your pocket like a small sun.

Back on the street, the city is a patient beast. It does not snarl; it kneels and lets you climb its spine, up a staircase that wasn’t there a minute ago. From the rooftop, the avenues unspool like riverbranches. The strangers stand with you, the air haunted by bakery sweetness and bus stop poetry. The scarf’s stars arrange into an arrow. It points not to a neighborhood but to your own chest.

“Compass,” the ink-stained man murmurs, tapping two fingers over your sternum.

You want to argue. You want a cross street and a station name and a numbered door. But the arrow doesn’t waver. The longer you stand there, the more the city below begins to hum a note you recognize: low, insistent, threaded through with laughter from another time. A memory ripples across your skin: late afternoon light, the heavy quiet before rain, someone calling your name from a room that smells like laundry and basil. The note resolves around the shape of your name like a drawer sliding into place.

The kind strangers begin to tell you stories as you climb down: the window-earring woman shares how she once took a train in the wrong direction and found the right friend; the baker from the bakery you passed emerges from nowhere to hand you a paper bag with a warm roll, though you never saw her leave the shop; the boy with the dog walks beside you for a block and teaches you the last line of his poem so the city will sit when you ask it to. The statue-horse clops silently along the curb until the pigeon gives permission with a single approving bob.

You notice the street signs now. They’re written in the handwriting of people you love: your father’s tidy angles, your mother’s looping patient curves, a friend’s hurried caps. One sign says: Turn Here If You’re Ready. Another says: You Can Always Turn Back. A third is blank until you approach, then blooms with a word that tastes like bread when you say it: Welcome.

At the corner, the group stops. The constellation scarf’s stars dim to a soft, earthly silver. “We’ll walk you to the edge,” she says. “Beyond that, it’s yours.”

“What if I get lost again?” you ask.

They smile as if this is exactly the right question. The ink-stained man takes your hand and draws a small compass on your palm with a finger, no ink needed. You can feel it, warm, like the orange in your pocket. The needle quivers, then steadies, pointing inward.

“Then you’ll find you,” the window-earring woman says. “And you is where home is.”

You look down the street. It’s just a street—cracked pavement, a cat slipping under a car, a cyclist humming under their breath. But threaded through it is that note again, unmistakable, rising.

You take a step. The city’s current adjusts to you rather than the other way around. The strangers don’t vanish; they turn into landmarks you can spot when you need to: a scarf of stars in a shop window, ink smudges on a cafe menu, the glint of window earrings in a bus’s reflection. The compass on your palm thrums. Beyond the next light, a building’s windows glow the color of stories being told in a kitchen. You know the sound of the chair that scrapes across that floor. You know the squeak the front door makes, like it’s laughing at your knock.

You reach it.

On the stoop, you pause. You fish the small sun from your pocket and peel it, the peel coming away in one curling ribbon. The scent lifts like a curtain in your head, and you can see it all: not the destination, but the days afterward—the muddy umbrellas, the misdelivered mail, the morning you water the plant and it forgives you, the evenings when the light bends gold and makes a halo of the dust. You see yourself opening the door, and you see that this time you’re not alone, even when you are. The strangers’ kindness sits in your chest, rearranged into something that belongs to you now.

You turn the knob. The door swings open as if it, too, has been waiting. Inside, the rooms are simple and imperfect, and absolutely right. Your footsteps sound like assurances rather than apologies. In the corner, a radio you didn’t know you owned is playing the city’s note, the same one. You realize it is your own voice, humming, the tune you’ve been carrying without knowing.

You set the peels in a glass bowl. You stand in the doorway and breathe. The bustling city outside keeps doing what it does: pigeons scold statues, buses sigh, someone laughs on a fourth-floor balcony. You aren’t separate from it anymore. You are a room inside it. You are its window opening.

Somewhere behind you, a bell rings—maybe a thrift shop door, maybe an oven timer. You don’t need to check. You know what it means. You cross the threshold. You say, “I’m here.”

And for the first time all day, the city says it back.
