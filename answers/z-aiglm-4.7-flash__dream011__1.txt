As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are **written in the direction of a spinning carousel, and they are all asking if you've forgiven your ex-partner for stealing your favorite sweatshirt seven years ago.**

You stare at the first page. The ink looks wet, like it was just smeared. The font is familiar, a little childish, but the content is impossible. You try to pick up your pen, but your hand feels heavy, weighted down by wet concrete. You manage to scratch out an answer next to question one, but the more you write, the more the words seem to wiggle off the page.

The walls of the classroom begin to dissolve, turning into a warm, grainy sand. You look up at the clock on the wall, but the hands are melting off like candles. The teacher—a figure in a shapeless lab coat—doesn't stand up to dismiss you. Instead, they simply smile a wide, terrifying smile and press a button. A buzzer sounds, not like an alarm, but like a kettle whistling.

You try to get up, but your legs are made of spaghetti. You fall forward, face-planting onto the floor of the classroom, but the floor is soft like a mattress. You look down and see that you are no longer taking an exam; you are actually a pile of laundry in the attic, waiting to be folded, as the room slowly fades into blackness and the dream ends.
