**Dream Continuation:**

The wheel shudders violently in your grasp, the cold brine stinging your face as the ship lurches into another monstrous wave. Lightning fractures the sky, illuminating the panicked faces of your crew. You bellow above the roar, voice steady despite the chaos: **“Reef the mainsail! Batten the hatches—*now!*”** They scatter to obey, their trust in your command overriding their fear. 

Your first mate, drenched and wide-eyed, shouts, “Captain! The helm’s not answering!” The deck tilts sharply, timbers groaning. You tighten your grip, instinctively turning the bow *into* the onslaught. “We’ll ride the swells head-on!” you snap. “Man the bilge pumps—if we take water, we’ll bleed it faster than it drowns us!” 

The crew moves like ghosts in the tempest, lashed by rain yet relentless. For a heartbeat, doubt creeps in: *What if the mast snaps? What if the rudder fails?* But then you remember the North Star, veiled by stormclouds but *there*, unwavering. “Steady!” you roar. “This storm’s no match for *Tidebreaker*’s bones!” 

A titanic wave rises, a wall of black water. You brace. “Hold fast!” The ship ascends, hovering at the crest… then plunges into the trough, shuddering but whole. And then—a break in the clouds. The rain slackens. The wind’s fury wanes to a mournful howl. 

By dawn, the sea is a heaving slate, exhausted. Your crew, battered but alive, gathers on deck. No cheers—just quiet nods, the unspoken grace of survival. Ahead, a sliver of gold etches the horizon. You adjust the wheel, breath steadying. *The storm wasn’t the end. It was the path.* 

The dream dissolves as the first sunlight kisses the waves, your resolve ironclad, the crew’s whispers trailing like mist: *“She brought us through.”*
