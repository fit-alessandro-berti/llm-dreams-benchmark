settle the matter by engaging in a game of chess. You both agree that the winner of the game will have their opinion respected and the other will concede. You set up the board and start playing. The game is intense, both of you are skilled players, and it's clear that neither of you will give up easily. As the game progresses, you find yourself deep in thought, carefully planning each move. Your friend, however, seems to be growing more agitated. Suddenly, they knock over the board in frustration. You're taken aback, but you remain calm. You suggest taking a break and resuming the game later when both of you have cooled down. Your friend agrees, and you both part ways, promising to finish the game another day. In the end, the argument remains unresolved, but you feel a sense of relief knowing that you handled the situation with maturity and respect for your friend's feelings.
