...written in a language that I invented when I was five years old, but have completely forgotten.

The symbols aren't just static ink; they are squirming like microscopic worms. I look at Question 1, and it isn't text at all—it’s a small, hyper-realistic painting of a window. I realize I have to physically climb *into* the paper to answer it.

I look around in panic, but the other students are all giant, silent birds wearing tuxedos, furiously pecking at their desks. I look back at my exam, and the paper has turned into a plate of spaghetti. The proctor floats by, defying gravity, and whispers, *"You have five minutes to eat the logic."*

My pen turns into a spoon, but it's made of ice and melting rapidly against my fingers. I know if I don't finish the spaghetti, I will never be an astronaut.
