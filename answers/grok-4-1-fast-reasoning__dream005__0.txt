each group seems stranger than the last. First, there's a cluster of Victorian-era gentlemen in top hats, debating quantum physics with pocket watches that tick backward. One offers me a sip from a flask of liquid starlight, which tastes like forgotten childhood summers, but when I ask about my friend, they all point in unison toward a swirling fog bank across the room.

Pushing through the mist, I stumble into a circle of glowing jellyfish floating mid-air, humming show tunes in perfect harmony. Their tentacles wave like party streamers, and the lead one드 massive, pulsating orb등hispers that my friend is "just behind the mirror maze." I thank it with a bow, and it gifts me a bioluminescent necklace that pulses with my heartbeat.

The mirror maze is endless, reflections fracturing into infinite versions of myself: one juggling flaming pineapples, another dancing the cha-cha with a shadow puppet. Laughter echoes, distorted and delighted, until I spot a group of clockwork birds perched on crystal branches, pecking out Morse code messages on typewriters. "S-O-U-T-H," they tap urgently, "F-O-L-L-O-W-T-H-E-M-U-S-I-C."

The music swells드 symphony of whale songs mixed with electric guitars드nd leads me to a pavilion where cartoon characters from my past mingle with aliens in neon suits. Bugs Bunny hands me a carrot cigar, puffing smoke rings shaped like question marks, while ET phones home on a rotary dial made of licorice. "Your friend's waiting," he says in that squeaky voice, pointing to a throne of clouds.

There, atop the clouds, sits my one familiar face듨y childhood dog, now human-sized, wearing a tuxedo and grinning with eternal puppy joy. "Took you long enough," he barks, tossing me a tennis ball that turns into a key as I catch it. The whole gathering erupts in applause, the ground shifts to a beach under starry skies, and we chase waves until the dream fades into warm, contented sleep.
