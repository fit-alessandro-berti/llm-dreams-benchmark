panic, but then you spot a towering digital billboard high above the teeming streets. It displays a glowing map of the city with your exact location marked in pulsing blue. Next to it, a message appears: "Meeting Venue: 20 mins away via Green Line."

You turn to find a sleek, automated subway entrance nearby. Descending into its shimmering depths, you board an eerily empty train. The car is silent, save for the soft hum of its engine and the distant sound of waves—strange, given you're underground.

As the train hurtles along, you glance out the window and realize the tunnel walls are not concrete—they're alive with bioluminescent plants, their soft glow illuminating elaborate mosaics of a forgotten civilization. Each station is more elaborate than the last, carved into grand halls with statues and fountains that sing as the train passes.

With five minutes to spare, you emerge in an impossibly lush park around the meeting venue. Birds with iridescent feathers dart around a grand crystalline structure that reflects the city's endless skyline onto itself. A guide, clad in robes of shimmering gold, greets you by name and leads you inside.

"They’ve been waiting for you," she says, her voice echoing as though through centuries.

You enter a hall where the meeting has already begun, only to realize everyone is watching you. A holographic display lights up around you, and a voice—your voice—begins to narrate a history only you could have known. The dream, it seems, is yours to direct now.
