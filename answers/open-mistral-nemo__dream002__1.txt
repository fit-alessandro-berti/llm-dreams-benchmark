As the first rumble of thunder echoes through the canopy above, the wind picks up, rustling the leaves and sending a chill down your spine. You quicken your pace, hoping to find shelter before the storm breaks. The once vibrant colors of the forest begin to fade, replaced by a gloomy gray as dark clouds gather overhead.

The air grows heavy with the scent of rain, and the first few fat droplets splatter onto the forest floor. You spot a small, ancient-looking cottage nestled between two towering trees, its chimney puffing out a thin trail of smoke. Grateful for the sight of shelter, you rush towards it, the wind whipping your hair around your face.

As you reach the cottage, you notice that the door is slightly ajar, inviting you inside. You push it open, stepping into a warm, cozy room filled with the comforting aroma of freshly baked bread. An old woman sits by the fireplace, her eyes twinkling as she looks up at you.

"Come in, child," she says, her voice as warm as the fire crackling behind her. "You're just in time for tea."

You close the door behind you, shutting out the storm, and take a seat at the table. As the old woman pours you a cup of steaming tea, you can't help but feel a sense of calm wash over you. The storm may be raging outside, but here, in this little cottage, you are safe and at peace.
