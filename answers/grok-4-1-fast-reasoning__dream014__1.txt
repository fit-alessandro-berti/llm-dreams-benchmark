You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you gratefully accept, following them through neon-lit alleys that twist like veins of light. Their faces shimmer, half-human, half-starlight, whispering directions in a language of colors—blue for left, crimson for straight ahead.

As you walk, the city unfolds impossibly: skyscrapers bloom into giant flowers, petals unfurling with the scent of rain-kissed earth. The strangers lead you to a hidden plaza where a carousel spins without horses, its seats carved from clouds. You climb aboard, and the world blurs into a whirlwind of memories—childhood laughter, forgotten loves, the warmth of a sun you haven't seen in years.

The carousel slows, and the strangers fade into fireflies, their lights guiding you to a door in the sky. You step through, waking with the echo of their voices: "Home is never lost; it's the dream that finds you." Your eyes flutter open, heart full, the city's hum now a gentle lullaby outside your window.
