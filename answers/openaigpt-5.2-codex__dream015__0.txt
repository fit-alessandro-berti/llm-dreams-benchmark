…form a small wandering caravan. You gather a mismatched crew—an old mechanic, a mute child with a gift for finding water, and a former teacher who has memorized half of a library. Together you move through ruined cities and silent forests, trading scraps for seeds, sharing stories by firelight, and repairing a battered solar truck you call Hope. One night, guided by a strange blue glow on the horizon, you reach a hidden valley where a clear spring still runs and wild fruit grows. As dawn breaks, you decide to stop running and start rebuilding. You plant the first seeds as the sun rises, and for the first time in the dream, the air smells not of ash, but of rain.
