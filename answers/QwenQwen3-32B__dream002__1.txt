You feel a storm approaching and the air grows heavy with electricity. The once-gentle rustle of leaves becomes a frantic whisper, as if the forest itself is warning you. Dark clouds swirl overhead, not just gray but tinged with eerie hues of violet and gold, and the wind carries a strange, melodic hum. Suddenly, the trees around you begin to *breathe*—their bark rippling like skin, branches stretching and twisting as if trying to grasp something unseen.  

A flash of lightning illuminates a figure standing at the edge of a clearing: a tall, translucent being with antlers like tangled crystal and eyes like storm clouds. It gestures toward a path that wasn’t there moments ago, a trail of glowing mushrooms pulsing faintly in rhythm with your heartbeat. Behind you, the storm surges forward, but the being’s presence feels… calming, as though it is part of the storm itself.  

As you step onto the mushroom path, the ground softens into something like water, yet it holds your weight. The being speaks, its voice a chorus of thunder and wind: *"Cross the threshold, but know this—what lies beyond the storm’s eye will reflect what you carry in your soul."*  

The next lightning strike reveals a chasm in the forest, where the sky splits open to reveal not stars, but a swirling vortex of memories—your own, flickering like fireflies: childhood laughter, old wounds, secrets you’ve buried. The storm howls louder, and the mushrooms dim… leaving you with a choice: leap into the vortex, or turn back while you still can.  

What do you do?
