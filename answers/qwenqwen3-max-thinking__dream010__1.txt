...and each challenge feels more surreal than the last.  

First, you’re handed a blank canvas and told to paint the sound of your own heartbeat. You dip your brush into a jar of liquid moonlight and realize the canvas is actually your skin—you begin to paint directly onto your arms, your chest, each stroke resonating with a thump you can both hear and feel. Judges nod solemnly as your pulse becomes visible in swirling gold.

Next, you’re asked to compose a résumé using only scents. You gather memories: the crisp ink of your first published article, the warm yeast of bread baked during late-night study sessions, the ozone tang of a thunderstorm the day you pitched your boldest idea. You pour them into a glass vial, and the hiring panel inhales deeply—two of them tear up.

Then comes the maze made of mirrors, each reflecting a different version of your future self. One wears a lab coat, another conducts an orchestra, a third tends to a garden on Mars. To pass, you must choose the reflection that feels most *true*—not the most impressive, not the safest, but the one whose eyes hold the quiet fire of purpose. You step through that mirror, and it shatters into butterflies.

Finally, you stand before a locked door labeled **“Your Dream Job.”** The key? It’s been in your pocket all along—a smooth, warm stone given to you at the start, inscribed with a single word: **“Begin.”**

You turn the key. The door opens not to an office or stage, but to a sunlit field where people are doing work that matters, laughing while they solve impossible problems. And there, in the center, is a desk with your name on it—empty, waiting.

A voice behind you says, “Congratulations. The competition was never about winning. It was about remembering you already had everything you needed.”

You wake up—but the stone is still in your hand.
