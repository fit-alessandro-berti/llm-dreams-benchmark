…take a deep breath. You look around and notice that everything—the room, the walls, even the air—seems a little hazy, shimmering softly with a golden light. Your friend’s words become muffled, like they’re speaking underwater. Something in you shifts: you realize what you’re arguing about isn’t so clear anymore. You suddenly feel lighter.

You decide to pause. Instead of raising your voice, you take your friend’s hand and say, “Can we try to understand each other, just for a moment?” The room transforms. The walls ripple away, revealing a quiet, open field beneath a surreal sky painted with swirling colors. The argument fades; it’s now just the two of you, facing each other under limitless sky.

Your friend’s features soften. There’s a moment of deep silence. Somehow, you both know you’re in a dream now, and that your words have power. “I don’t want to lose you over this,” you say.

Suddenly, the sensation of peace and clarity floods through you. Everything that felt so urgent is now distant, almost forgotten. Together, you and your friend start to laugh—first nervously, then joyfully—feeling the strange freedom that only happens in dreams. The sky above blossoms with stars, and you wake up feeling a lingering sense of reassurance, remembering only the laughter and the feeling of connection.
