symbols etched into its surface. The patterns seem to shift and change subtly as you turn the box in your hands. You feel an odd sense of familiarity, as though you've seen these symbols before but can't quite place where.

You try to open the box, pressing and sliding every part of it, but it remains stubbornly sealed. Frustration builds, but you can't shake the feeling that whatever is inside holds immense importance.

Suddenly, you hear a faint whisper, almost as though the box itself is speaking to you. The voice is soft but urgent, urging you to "look closer." Following the command, you notice one of the symbols glowing faintly. As you touch it, the symbol sinks into the box like a button, and with a soft click, the top of the box begins to slide open.

Inside, instead of an object, you find a small, shimmering portal. You peer into it, seeing swirling colors and what looks like another world. Without hesitation, you reach into the portal, and as your hand disappears into it, you feel a pull, like the universe itself is drawing you in.

In an instant, you’re no longer holding the box. Instead, you’re standing in an endless, star-filled void. A figure approaches—it’s you, but not quite you. Somehow, this version of yourself knows things you don't, and they reach out, clasping your hand. "The journey begins here," they say.

And with that, the void fades, and you're back where you started, only now you feel different—changed. And the box? It’s gone, but you sense it's not truly gone. It's waiting... for the next time.
