You start to **run**, but your legs feel heavy, as if you are wading through thick, invisible water, dragging you down even as you desperately try to accelerate. The buildings around you begin to loom larger, their windows flickering like dying television screens, casting a kaleidoscope of neon shadows across your face. You pass a street corner where the traffic lights are actually tiny, breathing flowers, but their petals don't sway in a breeze—they pulse in time with a steady, hypnotic drumbeat that is growing louder in your ears. You finally see a neon sign hanging from a twisting spire: *The Somnambulist’s Lounge.* The door is open, and inside, you see a single table set for two, though you are the only guest.
