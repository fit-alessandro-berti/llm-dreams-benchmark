walk away to cool down. As you step outside, the air is crisp and the sky is painted with hues of twilight. You find yourself in a quiet park, the distant hum of the city fading into the rustling leaves.

A bench catches your eye, and as you sit, you notice a small, intricately carved wooden box tucked beneath it. Curious, you pick it up and open it. Inside, there’s a single, handwritten note that reads: *"The things that divide us are often smaller than the things that bind us."*

Just then, your friend appears beside you, their expression softened. They sit down and sigh. "I didn’t mean to push so hard," they say. "I just… I care about this, but I care about you more."

The tension between you dissolves as you both realize the argument wasn’t about winning—it was about understanding. The dream shifts, and suddenly you’re laughing together, the weight of the disagreement lifting like mist in the morning sun.

Would you like to explore what happens next, or add more details to the dream?
