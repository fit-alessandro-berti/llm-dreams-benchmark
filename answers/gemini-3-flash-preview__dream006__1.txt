...and you begin to speak, but instead of words, a soft, rhythmic hum vibrates from your chest. 

As the sound leaves your lips, it takes the form of tiny, iridescent bubbles that drift out over the front rows. The audience doesn't look confused; they reach out, their fingers grazing the shimmering spheres. Every time a bubble pops, a vivid memory that isn't yours flashes before your eyes: the smell of rain on hot asphalt, the weight of a heavy secret, the precise blue of a winter morning.

The more you "speak," the more the auditorium begins to dissolve. The velvet seats turn into tall stalks of wheat that sway in a wind you cannot feel. The ceiling cracks open, revealing not the night sky, but a vast, calm ocean hanging upside down above you, where whales made of starlight swim through the deep.

You realize you aren't giving a speech at all—you are weaving everyone in the room into a single, shared thought. You feel their heartbeats sync with yours, a thunderous, collective rhythm that shakes the floorboards. Just as you reach the climax of your silent melody, the gravity in the room tilts. You and the entire audience begin to float, drifting upward toward the overhead ocean. 

You open your mouth one last time to deliver the final, most important truth, but the air suddenly tastes like cold morning mist, and the faces of the crowd begin to blur into the fabric of your pillow. The secret stays behind, hovering just out of reach, as the light of the waking world begins to bleed through the edges of the room.
