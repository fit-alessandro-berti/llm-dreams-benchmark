...grip the worn brass wheel with both hands, knuckles whitening against the cold metal. The sea rises in walls around you — dark green and furious, veined with white foam — and for a moment you feel the ship *breathe*, a living thing shuddering beneath your boots.

"Captain!" your first mate shouts over the roar, her voice barely threading through the wind. Rain lashes sideways. A lantern sways and dies.

And then something strange happens, the way things do in dreams.

You realize you *know* this storm. Not from charts or years at sea. You know it the way you know the inside of your own chest. The waves have a rhythm — *your* rhythm — a heartbeat you recognize.

You close your eyes.

The crew falls silent, watching.

You let go of the wheel.

The ship lurches — someone gasps — but you raise one hand and point northwest, toward what appears to be nothing but darkness and chaos. "There," you say, with a certainty that surprises even you. "The storm is hollow in the middle. We sail *into* it."

"That's madness," the navigator whispers.

"It's the only way through."

And slowly — *slowly* — the bow turns. The waves fight you. The masts cry out.

Then, impossibly, the water begins to calm, and ahead of you, ringed by lightning like a cathedral...

...there is a circle of perfect, impossible stillness.

And in the center of it, something *waiting*.

You lean forward, heart hammering, trying to see what it is—

*What do you want to find there, in the eye of your storm?*
