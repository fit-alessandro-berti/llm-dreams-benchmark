**The Dream Continues:**

You step toward the blank canvas, your fingers hovering just above its surface. The air hums with possibility—like the quiet before a storm, or the first breath of a newborn world. The moment you touch it, the canvas *shudders*.

A single, pulsing dot of light appears in the center, not quite gold, not quite violet, but something alive—like a star caught in the act of being born. It expands, fracturing into jagged, glowing veins that twist into impossible geometries: a cube unfolding into a spiral, a circle dissolving into a lattice of floating eyes that blink at you in silent recognition. The edges of the canvas ripple like water, and suddenly, you’re not just *looking* at the painting—you’re *inside* it.

The world around you warps. The ground beneath your feet becomes a vast, shifting tapestry of overlapping shapes—some familiar (a door, a tree, a face), others utterly alien (a house with too many windows, a river that flows upward, a clock whose hands spin in every direction at once). The colors bleed into one another: a sky that’s both deep ocean blue and molten copper, grass that hums with the sound of distant laughter, shadows that move like living things.

Then, the canvas *speaks*—not with words, but with sensation. A hand (not yours) brushes your shoulder, and you turn to see a figure standing behind you. They have no face, only a smooth, shifting surface where features might be—sometimes a mouth, sometimes eyes, sometimes nothing at all. They gesture toward the painting, and the moment you look back, the scene *rearranges itself* around you.

Now, the canvas is no longer flat. It’s a doorway. Beyond it, you see:
- A **library** where the books are made of smoke, and the shelves rearrange themselves into constellations when you hum.
- A **garden** where flowers bloom in reverse, their petals uncurling into seeds that float away like dandelion wishes—but the wishes are memories, not dreams.
- A **mirror** that doesn’t reflect you, but instead shows a version of yourself from a future where you *chose differently*. That version smiles and waves, then reaches out a hand.

The faceless figure nudges you forward. *"Pick one,"* they seem to say, though their voice is the sound of wind through an empty room.

You hesitate—because you know, if you step through, you might not come back. Or worse, you might come back *changed*, with the colors and shapes of this world seeping into your bones, making you see the ordinary in a way that unravels you.

But the canvas is calling. And deep down, you already know: this is where the real dream begins.
