# The Awakening

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **learn how to survive with nothing but your wits and the clothes on your back**.

The air smells different—cleaner, sharper, with the distant scent of wood smoke and something floral you can't quite name. You're lying on a straw pallet in a small stone room, pale morning light filtering through gaps in wooden shutters. The bedframe is hand-carved, the blankets woven from rough wool in earthy tones.

You stumble outside and find yourself in a village of thatched-roof cottages. People in simple linen clothing move about their morning routines—drawing water from a well, tending chickens, chopping wood. A blacksmith's hammer rings out rhythmically from down the lane. No cars. No phones. No hum of electricity.

An elderly woman notices your confused expression and approaches you cautiously. She speaks in a language you somehow understand, though it feels foreign on your tongue. "You look lost, traveler. Are you well?"

Your mind races. How did you get here? When is "here"? The questions spiral, but one truth settles firmly in your chest: you are a stranger in this world, and survival will demand everything you have. You take a deep breath, push down your panic, and prepare to begin the most challenging journey of your life—building a new existence from nothing but determination and the primitive skills you suddenly realize you'll have to discover.
