**Dream Completion:**

As you step onto the stage, the weight of silence presses down. Your throat tightens, palms slick with sweat. The spotlight blinds you, but you catch a glimmer—a single face in the front row, smiling softly, eyes crinkled with warmth. Your grandmother, long passed, nods once. A breath fills your lungs, steady as tides.  

When you speak, your voice reverberates, not as your own, but as a chorus—whispers of every person who ever believed in you. The crowd begins to shimmer, edges blurring into constellations. Your words twist into ribbons of light, weaving through the air, painting stories the audience *remembers* but never lived. A man in the third row dissolves into laughter that sparks like fireflies; a teenager’s tears pool into a mirrored lake at their feet.  

The stage melts into a forest floor. Moss cushions your steps as the audience becomes ancient trees, their leaves rustling approval. You realize you’re not speaking at all anymore—you’re singing, and the melody is a secret the world forgot. When the final note hangs, the forest sighs, and you wake with the taste of honey on your tongue, certain you’ve just told the truth for the first time.  

The fear is gone. All that remains is the hum of stars in your veins.
