…every clique buzzes with its own odd, liquid dialect. One knot of guests speaks only in bird song; when I drift too near, the air ripples with bright trills and my own vocal cords fail, turning to warm honey. I back away, feeling my tongue flutter against my palate like a trapped sparrow.

The next circle is quieter. Their faces are half-obscured by shifting shadows that peel off the ceiling lamps. One woman steps forward and offers me her shadow, extending it from her sleeve like an extra limb. I take its silken edge, but the moment I do I lose my own silhouette—my boundary blurs and I feel my edges fogging into the room’s wallpaper. Panic sparks; I yank my hand back and hurry on.

There is a buffet. The silver platters hold cities of icing sugar, tiny glass cathedrals that collapse when I exhale. I pinch one roof between my fingers; sweetness dissolves, but inside is a curled scrap of paper: “Your friend is under the next mask.” I stuff it into my pocket, heart trip-hammering.

A figure glides past clad in papier-mâché armor printed with headlines from tomorrow’s newspapers: “Sea Refuses All Reflections,” “Moon Cancels Itself at Dawn.” The mask shows only my owneyes reflected back at me—wide, searching. I tap its shoulder; the mask twists with a rustle, and suddenly it’s you: my one familiar face, now curved into the paper visage of tomorrow.

You grab my wrist and lead me through an arch of twilight that wasn’t there minutes ago. Other guests peel away like collage layers. We step over a threshold made of shoe-uppers from every party or dream that’s ever lost a sole. Underneath it, colors begin to die—gold becomes tarnished brass, our shadows turn charcoal, the room’s music stretches into a yawn low enough to swallow thought.

“Before we leave,” you whisper, “choose what sound you’ll keep.” Around us, everything is hushing. The clink of glass dims, the bird-song group falls mute. I hear my own pulse, steady as a secret. I choose that; it stays, inside my ears like a metronome.

We push open an emergency exit painted on the wall—the handle’s only graphite but it screeches anyway. On the other side is the gathering’s echo: chairs rocking solo under absent guests, confetti twitching upward as though rehearsing a reentry. The horizon is the color of before-the-rain, and your face is soft paper dissolving at the edges.

Behind us, the party folds itself into an envelope. You seal it by pressing one finger to your lips then mine, and we post ourselves into the night’s open throat.

The last thing I remember is the sound of my pulse translating to footsteps as we walk deeper into a city that’s only sound and shapeless street.
