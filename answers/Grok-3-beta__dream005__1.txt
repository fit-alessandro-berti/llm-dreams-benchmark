overhear snippets of their conversations—laughter, debates, and whispers weaving through the air. The room is vast, a sprawling maze of faces and voices, lit by the warm flicker of chandeliers that seem to sway ever so slightly, as if breathing with the crowd. You catch a glimpse of your friend across the room, their familiar silhouette framed by a cluster of strangers, but before you can reach them, the floor beneath you shifts. It’s subtle at first—a ripple, like water underfoot—then the tiles begin to crack and peel away, revealing a shimmering pool of liquid silver beneath.
You’re not alarmed, though; the crowd doesn’t seem to notice, still chattering away as if the ground hasn’t just transformed. You step forward, and your foot dips into the silver—it’s warm, like sunlight caught in a puddle. Suddenly, you’re sinking, not in a panicked fall, but a slow, deliberate descent, as if the liquid is pulling you somewhere intentional. The voices above fade, replaced by a low hum that vibrates through your bones.
You emerge in a different place entirely—a forest, but not like any you’ve known. The trees are tall and spiraled, their bark glinting with flecks of gold, and the air smells of cinnamon and something electric. Your friend is there, waiting, but they’re different now—their eyes glow faintly, and they gesture toward a path winding deeper into the woods. “You’re late,” they say, voice echoing oddly, as if it’s coming from the trees themselves. You follow, and the path twists upward, defying gravity, until you’re walking on the underside of branches, stars blinking through the canopy below your feet.
Ahead, there’s a clearing where shadowy figures dance in a circle, their forms flickering like flames. You feel a pull to join them, but your friend grabs your hand—cold, firm—and whispers, “Not yet.” The dream hums louder, and you realize the sound is coming from you, too, as if you’re part of whatever this place is. The figures turn to face you, their eyes mirrors of your own, and just as they step closer, the forest dissolves into a burst of light—and you wake up.
