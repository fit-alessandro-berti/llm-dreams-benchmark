You start to panic, your heart racing as you spin in circles, scanning the towering spires of glass and chrome that pierce a sky swirling with impossible colors—purples bleeding into electric blues. Pedestrians blur past like ghosts, their faces melting into smiles that whisper directions in languages you half-remember from childhood dreams. You hail a cab, but the driver is a giant owl with glowing eyes, who nods sagely and floors it straight up a skyscraper wall, the city folding inward like origami.

Time fractures—your watch spins backward, then fast-forwards, the meeting now mere minutes away. You leap from the cab onto a rooftop party where guests in tuxedos made of clouds toast your arrival. "You're late!" booms a voice from a floating conference table, but as you sit, the agenda dissolves into confetti, and the important client morphs into your childhood pet goldfish, swimming laps in a martini glass. Laughter echoes as the city crumbles into stars, and you wake up tangled in sheets, the alarm blaring exactly one hour from now.
