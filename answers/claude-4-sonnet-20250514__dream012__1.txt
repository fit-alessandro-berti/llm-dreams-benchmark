*gripping the ship's wheel as salt spray stings my face*

...and you feel the weight of every soul aboard pressing against your shoulders like the howling wind. The compass spins wildly, as if the storm has torn away even magnetic north. Through the chaos, I glimpse something impossible—a lighthouse that shouldn't exist here, hundreds of miles from any shore, its beam cutting through the darkness in rhythm with my own heartbeat.

\ first mate calls out, but when I turn, his face shifts and blurs like water. \ maps... they're changing!\d before me, watching as the ink runs and reforms, showing islands that drift like clouds, passages that open and close with each lightning flash. The ship isn't just fighting the storm—it's sailing through the very boundaries of what's real.

The crew's voices become a chorus, speaking in unison: \ don't remember what home looks like anymore. The storm isn't just around us—it's inside the ship, inside my bones. I am the captain, I am the ship, I am the storm itself. The wheel dissolves in my hands like sea foam, and suddenly I'm falling upward into the lighthouse beam, becoming light, becoming the very guidance I was searching for...

*the dream shifts and flows like tide*
