...reach for your notes, but your hands close around nothing. The podium is bare. You glance down at yourself and realize you're wearing your childhood pajamas - the ones with the little rockets on them - and one sock. Just one.

The audience doesn't seem to notice, or perhaps they don't mind. They lean forward anyway, thousands of faces tilting toward you like flowers toward sun, and something about their collective patience feels *generous* rather than threatening.

You open your mouth and what comes out first is not words but music - a low hum that surprises even you. It reverberates off the ceiling of the auditorium, which you now notice has become the night sky, open and enormous, the roof simply *gone*.

Then the words arrive, and they are not the words you prepared. They are older words, ones you didn't know you knew. You speak about the summer you were eight and found a injured bird and how you carried it home in cupped hands, terrified of your own heartbeat, afraid the vibration alone might break something.

The audience exhales together. Someone in the third row is crying, and you understand somehow that they are crying about their *own* bird, their own cupped hands, their own ancient tenderness.

The stars above you get closer.

You are not afraid.

You keep talking.
