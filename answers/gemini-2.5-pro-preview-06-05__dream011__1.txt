...not questions at all.

They are small, impossibly detailed dioramas set into the thick, creamy paper, each one under a tiny glass dome. My pen feels useless in my hand. There are no lines for answers, only these silent, three-dimensional scenes.

The first diorama is my childhood home. A miniature version of my eight-year-old self is sitting on the lawn, meticulously pulling the petals off a daisy. I lean closer and feel a cold dread creep up my spine. I remember this exact moment. The implied question hangs in the air, unspoken but deafening: *What were you wishing for? And why did you cry when you ran out of petals?*

I look around the vast, silent examination hall. The other students are not writing. One is trying to re-fold a tiny, crumpled letter in his diorama. Another is weeping silently as she attempts to repair a miniature broken fence with a pair of tweezers. No one is making a sound. The proctor, a tall, shadowy figure whose face I can't quite see, glides between the aisles, not looking at us, but at the scenes we are supposed to be fixing.

My eyes snap back to my paper. The second diorama. It's the first time I ever told a significant lie. I see the scene play out: my mother’s trusting face, my own small, defiant one. The question isn't "What was the lie?" but something far more piercing: *Describe the taste of the air right after the words left your mouth.*

My heart hammers against my ribs. This isn't a test of knowledge; it's a test of memory, of regret, of the self. My entire future career depends on my ability to confront these moments I've spent a lifetime trying to forget.

I turn to the last page. It is the most terrifying of all.

It's a diorama of this exact room, this exact moment. A tiny, perfect replica of me is sitting at this desk, staring down at an even tinier exam paper. And inside that microscopic diorama, I know there is another, and another, stretching down into an infinite, recursive loop of my own failure.

The proctor stops beside my desk. I still can't see its face, but I feel its gaze on me. A single, resonant whisper echoes not in the room, but inside my own head.

*Well? Begin.*
