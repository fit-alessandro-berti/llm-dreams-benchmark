...stand tall at the helm, my eyes fixed on the horizon as the winds howl and the waves crash against the ship. The wooden creaks and groans beneath my feet, but I remain steadfast, my grip on the wheel firm and unwavering.

"Mr. Jenkins, take in the sails!" I shout above the din of the storm. "We need to reduce our exposure to the wind!"

My first mate nods and relays the order to the crew, who scramble to comply. The sails are reefed in, and the ship responds by stabilizing slightly, its motion less erratic as it rises and falls with the waves.

I grin, my teeth clenched against the wind. "Well done, lads! We're through the worst of it! Keep her steady, and we'll—"

But as I speak, a faint cry cuts through the storm's din – a cry that sends a shiver down my spine. "Land ho!" someone shouts. "Dead ahead, Captain!"

My heart racing, I peer through the spray and the rain, and what I see makes my blood run cold...
