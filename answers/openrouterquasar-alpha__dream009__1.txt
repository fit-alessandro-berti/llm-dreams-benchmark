adapt quickly. The air smells different든arthy and raw드nd the distant sound of livestock mingles with the chatter of people dressed in handmade clothes. You have nothing but your wits. 

As you wander through the bustling marketplace, you realize you뇳l need to find food and shelter. You watch an elderly woman skillfully bartering for vegetables; perhaps you can learn from her. Your modern knowledge could be useful here, but for now, you keep a low profile. 

You decide your first priority is to learn the language and customs so you don뇺 stand out. As the sun begins to set, you find a quiet spot beneath a sprawling tree. Overhead, stars emerge듯npolluted by city lights드nd for a moment, you feel a strange peace. 

Tomorrow, you tell yourself, you will seek out work or trade a simple skill. You breathe deeply, determined to survive드nd maybe even thrive들n this strange but fascinating lost world.
