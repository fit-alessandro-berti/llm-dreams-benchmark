You start to frantically search your pockets, hoping to find a phone or a map, but instead you pull out a small, ornate key. As you examine it, the city around you begins to shift; the skyscrapers twist into gnarled trees, the concrete beneath your feet softens into grass, and the air fills with the scent of lavender. People around you become translucent, gliding past like ghosts. A clock tower in the distance chimes, each note stretching time, the sound echoing endlessly. Suddenly, a child with glowing eyes tugs your sleeve and hands you a compass that points not north, but inward, toward your chest. 'Follow your heartbeat,' the child whispers before vanishing. You place your hand over your heart, feeling its steady rhythm, and as you do, the world dissolves into a bright light. You wake with a start, the alarm blaring, and realize the meeting is about to start—right here, in your own home, as a video call. Relief washes over you, and you laugh at the absurdity of it all.
