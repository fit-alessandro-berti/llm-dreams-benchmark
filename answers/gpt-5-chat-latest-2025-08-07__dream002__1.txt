…the air grows heavy, thick with the scent of rain and something else—something strange, electric, almost metallic. The soft sunlight that filtered through the leaves moments ago has vanished, replaced by a restless dimness. The branches above you sway and creak, leaves whispering frantic secrets to one another.  

In the distance, a low, resonant rumble shakes the ground beneath your feet—not like thunder, but deeper, as though the forest itself were speaking. A cool wind brushes past your cheek, and with it comes a rush of memories you don’t recognize: fleeting visions of towering shadows, glowing eyes in the dark, and a silver key glittering in your own hand.  

The path ahead bends sharply to the left, but you notice something unusual—among tangled roots, the earth has cracked open, revealing a faint golden light pulsing from below, in rhythm with your heartbeat.  

Do you approach the light… or turn toward the path and the oncoming storm?  

Would you like me to continue the dream down one path, or offer you both possible outcomes?
