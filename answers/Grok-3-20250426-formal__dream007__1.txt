take a step back to calm the situation. You suggest going for a walk together to clear your heads and continue the conversation in a more relaxed setting. As you both step outside, the environment shifts unexpectedly— the familiar streets of your neighborhood transform into a vibrant, surreal forest with glowing plants and a soft, ethereal light filtering through the trees.

Your friend, still visibly upset, seems to notice the change but doesn’t comment on it. Instead, they start walking ahead, and you follow, feeling the tension between you both linger. The path winds deeper into the forest, and you come across a small, crystal-clear stream. By the stream, there’s an old wooden bench, oddly familiar, as if it’s been waiting for you both. You sit down together, and the sound of the flowing water seems to ease the air between you.

Without warning, your friend turns to you and says, “This isn’t just about us, is it? There’s something bigger here.” Their words feel heavy, as if they’re not just talking about your argument anymore. You notice a faint glow emanating from their hands, and when you look down, your own hands are glowing too. The forest around you begins to hum with a low, resonant energy, and you realize the argument you were having is connected to something far greater— a choice or responsibility you both share in this strange, dreamlike world.

At this point, you feel a surge of clarity. You know you need to address the root of your disagreement, not just as friends, but as part of this larger, mysterious purpose. You open your mouth to speak, ready to propose a way forward, when the dream shifts again— what happens next? Would you like me to continue the dream or adjust any part of it?
