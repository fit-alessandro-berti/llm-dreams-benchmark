…and you follow them down a narrow side street that seems to glow with its own warm light. The noise of the city fades behind you, replaced by the soft hum of conversation and the rhythmic tapping of footsteps on old cobblestone.

They lead you to a small courtyard you’re certain wasn’t on any map. Lanterns sway gently overhead, casting ripples of gold across the walls. In the center is a fountain shaped like an open book, water flowing over its pages as if new stories are being written every second.

One of the strangers smiles and hands you a tiny compass—its needle spinning wildly at first, then slowly settling, pointing not north but toward a door in the far corner of the courtyard. The door is painted a deep blue, the color of twilight just before the first stars appear.

“You’re not lost,” one of them says softly. “You’re simply heading somewhere new.”

When you open the door, a warm breeze rushes out, carrying the scent of rain and something familiar you can’t name. You step through, and as the door closes behind you, you realize the compass is glowing gently in your hand, its light pulsing like a heartbeat—steady, certain, guiding.

And suddenly, you don’t feel alone at all.
