...step hesitantly toward them, the city’s cacophony—honking horns, distant sirens, the murmur of a thousand conversations—fading to a hush as if the world itself leaned in to listen. Their faces are soft with empathy, eyes holding no judgment, only warmth. One extends a hand, palm open, not demanding, just offering.

You reach out, and the moment your fingers brush theirs, the streetlights flicker—not out, but into something softer, golden, like candlelight caught in amber. The concrete beneath your feet softens into worn cobblestones, and the skyscrapers around you seem to lean backward, their sharp edges blurring into the silhouette of old brick buildings draped in ivy.

“This way,” says a woman with silver-streaked hair and a scarf the color of midnight, her voice like wind through willow branches. She turns, and the others fall into step around you—not crowding, but forming a gentle circle of presence, as if holding space just for you.

As you walk, the city transforms. Rain-slicked alleyways bloom with paper lanterns. Steam rising from a food cart smells of cinnamon and something you haven’t smelled since childhood—maybe your grandmother’s kitchen, or a bakery from a summer long ago. You realize you’re not just being led through streets, but through layers of memory, each turn peeling back another year of loneliness you’d forgotten you carried.

Then, at the corner of a square where fountains spill water like liquid starlight, they stop. The man who first offered his hand gestures to a small, unmarked door set into the base of an ancient oak growing right through the pavement. “It’s yours,” he says simply.

You push the door open. Inside isn’t a room, but a quiet forest glade under a sky dusted with unfamiliar constellations. A single path winds ahead, dappled in moonlight. You look back—but the strangers are gone. Only their kindness lingers, humming in your chest like a compass.

And for the first time, you’re not lost.  
You’re found.
