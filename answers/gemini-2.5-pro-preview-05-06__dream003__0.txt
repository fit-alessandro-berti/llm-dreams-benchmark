...intricate patterns and **symbols that seem to shift and shimmer as you try to focus on them. They're not just etched; they feel almost alive, warm beneath your fingertips.** One particular spiral draws your attention. As you trace its path with your finger, a low hum resonates from the box, vibrating through your hand and up your arm.

The air around you grows thick, like honey, and the dim, undefined space of your dream begins to swirl with colours that have no name. The patterns on the box glow brighter, casting dancing shadows that writhe and twist into half-formed shapes – a leaping stag, a celestial sphere, a tree with roots reaching into an unseen abyss.

You realize the patterns are responding not just to your touch, but to your *intention*. You *want* it to open. You focus on that desire, pouring your curiosity and a strange sense of longing into the box. The humming intensifies, and the spiral you were tracing begins to rotate, slowly at first, then faster, until it detaches from the surface of the box like a tiny, glowing Catherine wheel.

It hovers in the air before you, then shoots towards a specific point on the box, striking it with a soft *thud*. Another symbol ignites. You understand. You must "activate" the symbols in a specific sequence, guided by an intuition that feels as old as time itself.

One by one, you touch them, following the pull in your gut. A symbol like a wave, then one resembling a feather, then a jagged lightning bolt. With each correct touch, a resonant chime, like distant temple bells, echoes in the dreamscape. The box trembles more violently.

Finally, you touch the last symbol – a perfect, empty circle.

Silence.

For a heart-stopping moment, nothing happens. Then, with a sound like a thousand indrawn breaths, the lid of the box doesn't creak open, but rather *unfolds*. Petal by intricate petal, the metallic-seeming material peels back, revealing not gold or jewels, but a swirling miniature galaxy contained within. Stars pulse, nebulae drift, and at its very center, a single point of light so brilliant it's almost painful to behold.

As you gaze into it, a profound sense of peace washes over you, a feeling of understanding everything and nothing all at once. The light reaches out, a tender filament, and touches your forehead.

And then, you begin to float...
