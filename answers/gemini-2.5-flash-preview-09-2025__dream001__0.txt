**You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to** run, the cobblestones under your worn shoes humming with a low, anxious frequency.

The city is a vertigo of impossible architecture: buildings lean inward at unnatural angles, and windows reflect fractured images of the shifting sky. I try to ask a figure standing near a glowing, emerald fountain—a man in a suit made entirely of static—but he simply dissolves into a cloud of TV snow when I approach.

*Fifty minutes.*

The tension in my chest feels like a tightening clock spring. I spot a map mounted on a lamppost. I lunge for it, only to find the map is merely a detailed, topographical rendering of my own handprint. Frustration mounts, transforming the air around me into a thick, syrupy substance that slows my sprint to a desperate wade.

Then, a sound breaks through the sensory overload: a deep, resonant *GONG*. It doesn't come from a bell, but from the ground itself. Following the rhythmic shockwaves, I look up and see the only recognizable feature in the whole labyrinth: a colossal, crystalline clock tower now piercing the ceiling of the perpetually twilight sky. It wasn't there a minute ago, yet it feels irrevocably *right*. That is the location.

*Thirty-five minutes.*

The journey begins. The avenue I’m on instantly transmutes its pavement into thousands of interlocking, wooden drawers. I have to hop from one to the next, careful not to look inside—I know instinctively that looking into the drawers would show me things I’ve deliberately forgotten, and I don’t have time for memory.

I reach the base of the clock tower. There are no doors, only a gaping mouth of darkness leading to a vertical shaft. I step inside, and the air immediately lifts me, not like an elevator, but like water. I am floating upward, faster and faster, past internal mechanisms that look like abstract gears carved from bone and pearl. The climb is too fast, the pressure is immense, and every upward movement forces a new, unfamiliar memory into my consciousness.

*Fifteen minutes.*

The ascent halts with a sickening lurch, and I stumble out onto a circular platform high above the sprawling, nameless metropolis. The air here is thin and tastes of metallic ozone. There is a single, unmarked, mahogany door.

My breathing is ragged. I look down at my watch—which is now a delicate glass orb filled with slowly swirling sand. The last grains are just beginning to fall.

*Three minutes.*

I slam my hand against the mahogany door. It swings inward silently, revealing not a boardroom, but a vast, quiet space the color of old moonlight.

At the center, gathered around a small, low table, are the attendees.

They are not people.

There is a half-eaten green apple, buzzing softly; a stack of seven unfiled tax forms tied with red thread; and a single, ancient, leather shoe resting sole-up. The light from the ceiling filters through them, giving them an unnerving depth.

I stagger into the room, leaning against the doorframe, gasping: “I—I’m sorry, I’m late. I got lost. I didn’t know the location, I—“

The green apple vibrates. The seven tax forms rustle in unison, and a tiny, dry voice issues from the shoe.

“Perfect timing,” the shoe says, its voice sounding like the sigh of distant traffic. “The meeting was only about one thing.”

I wait, dripping sweat and anxiety, ready for the revelation that explains the frantic hour, the impossible city, and the silent pressure of the dream.

The stack of tax forms straightens itself mathematically. The apple stops buzzing.

"We were just waiting to confirm," the shoe continues. "We needed to know that you are, precisely, *this* tired."

And then, the three objects go completely still. The moonlight intensifies, the tension snaps, and the entirety of the vast, complex city outside the glass windows collapses inward like a sheet of burning tissue paper.

The sound of the implosion is only a soft, contented sigh, and I fall forward into the soft, deep silence.
