Panicking, but then you notice a faint, glowing path on the sidewalk, as if made of shimmering stardust. It leads you through winding alleyways and bustling streets, where people move in slow motion and the air hums with an otherworldly energy.

As you follow the path, you realize it’s reacting to your steps—changing direction slightly when you hesitate, speeding up when you walk with purpose. The buildings around you shift shapes, morphing from sleek modern towers into ancient temples, then into trees with glowing leaves.

Suddenly, the path ends at a door with no building around it—just a floating doorway suspended in the sky. You step through and find yourself in a grand, circular chamber. At the center sits a figure with a face you can’t quite focus on. They gesture to an empty chair and say, *"You’re right on time. We’ve been waiting for you."*

But then you realize—you don’t actually know what this meeting is about. The figure smiles knowingly and says, *"That’s the point."*

And just as you’re about to ask what that means, the room dissolves into mist, and you wake up with the lingering sense that the dream was trying to tell you something... but what?

*(Would you like to explore the meaning, or keep dreaming?)*
