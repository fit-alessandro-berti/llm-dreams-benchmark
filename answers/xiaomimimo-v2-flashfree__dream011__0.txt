suddenly written in a language you don't recognize. The letters seem to float slightly off the page, shimmering with a faint, ethereal light. Panic starts to rise in your chest—this is impossible, how can you pass if you can't even read the questions?

But then, you look closer at the first symbol. It isn't a word; it's a picture of a childhood memory, specifically the sound of rain on the roof of your grandmother's house. You realize with a jolt that the "answers" aren't written responses. To answer, you have to *feel* the correct emotion or recall a specific sensory memory.

For the second question, which depicts a tangled knot of vines, you think about the feeling of solving a complex puzzle, the satisfaction of untangling a mess. The knot on the page glows gold and smooths out.

You reach the final question. It is a blank, dark square. There are no images, no floating letters. Just emptiness. You wait for a long time, tapping your pen, trying to feel the answer. But nothing comes.

Then, you remember that this is a dream. You don't have to find the answer; you can create it. You close your eyes, take a deep breath, and project your deepest hope for the future onto the blank square. When you open your eyes, the dark square has transformed into a perfectly drawn door, slightly ajar, with warm, inviting light pouring out from the other side.

You reach out, turn the handle, and step through.
