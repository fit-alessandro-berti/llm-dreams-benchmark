You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find water. My throat is raw, and a gritty dust coats my tongue. The air smells of woodsmoke and something else… something earthy and faintly metallic. Cobblestone streets wind between buildings constructed of heavy, grey stone, their roofs thatched with reeds. People bustle about in homespun clothing – rough wools and dyed linens, practical and muted in color. No cars, no electricity, no screens. Just the rhythmic clip-clop of horses’ hooves and the murmur of unfamiliar voices speaking a language that feels vaguely familiar, yet utterly foreign.**

Panic prickles at the edges of my awareness, quickly followed by a chilling pragmatism. I'm not in Kansas anymore, or anywhere remotely resembling it. This isn't a historical reenactment, it's...real. 

The sun beats down mercilessly. I try to recall anything from history classes, anything that might help.  The clothes people wear suggest a medieval or early Renaissance setting, but something about the architecture feels...off. More angular, more austere. 

I push myself forward, away from the crowded marketplace.  My modern shoes are already scuffing and tearing on the uneven stone. I need to blend in, and I need to find water. 

I spot a woman hauling buckets from a well, her face weathered and lined.  She eyes me with suspicion as I approach.  I try to speak, but my voice feels thick and clumsy.  "Water...please..." I croak, gesturing weakly at the bucket.  

Her expression softens slightly. She doesn’t speak my language, but she seems to understand my desperation.  She ladles a generous amount into a wooden cup and offers it to me.  The water is cool and surprisingly sweet.  I drink deeply, savoring each precious drop. 

As I drink, I notice something peculiar.  The well itself isn’t constructed of stone like the surrounding buildings. Instead, it's built around a gnarled, ancient tree, its roots intertwining with the stone supports.  The air around the tree shimmers with a faint, almost imperceptible energy.  

And as I look closer, I see something etched into the bark of the tree - a symbol. A spiral within a circle. It stirs something deep within me, a forgotten memory, a half-formed understanding.  

Suddenly, I realize finding water is just the first step.  I need to understand *where* I am, *when* I am, and perhaps… why.  And the symbol on that tree? I have a feeling it holds the key. The key to getting home. Or, at least, surviving in this strange and unfamiliar world.  My heart pounds.  This is no longer just a dream. It's a quest.
