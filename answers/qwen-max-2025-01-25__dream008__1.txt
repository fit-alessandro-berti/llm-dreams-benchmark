...feel a sudden surge of panic rising in your chest. The room seems to shrink as you glance at the clock on the wall, its ticking now deafeningly loud. Your coworkers are busy with their own tasks, oblivious to the weight that’s just been dropped onto your shoulders.

You take a deep breath and try to steady yourself. "Okay," you mutter under your breath, opening the project brief. As you scan through it, the words seem to blur together—impossible deadlines, unclear requirements, and an expectation for perfection. It feels like the universe is conspiring against you.

Just then, something strange happens. A soft hum fills the air, growing louder by the second. Everyone around you freezes mid-motion, as if time itself has stopped. Papers hang suspended in midair where they were accidentally dropped, coffee cups remain tilted halfway to open mouths, and even the fluorescent lights above flicker oddly.

A figure appears before you—a glowing silhouette radiating calm energy. Their voice echoes gently in your mind: *"You have everything you need within you."*

Before you can respond, the dream shifts again. You're no longer in the office but standing in a vast library filled with endless rows of books. Each book glows faintly, pulsating like a heartbeat. One particular book floats toward you, landing softly in your hands. Its cover reads: **"The Art of Impossible."**

As you open the book, pages flip on their own until they settle on a single sentence written in bold letters:  
*"Break it down into pieces smaller than fear."*

Suddenly, you're back in the office. Time resumes its normal flow, and everyone continues as though nothing happened. But this time, you feel different. Calmer. Stronger. You look at the project again, pick up a pen, and begin breaking it into manageable steps. 

Your boss watches from afar, raising an eyebrow in surprise at how quickly you've taken charge. For the first time all day, you smile—not because the task ahead is easy, but because you know you’re capable of more than you ever imagined.

And just as you dive into the work, the dream fades, leaving you with a lingering sense of empowerment...
