stand at the helm, not with white-knuckled fear, but with a focused calm. The ship groans around you, a living thing straining against the wind and waves. Cold salt spray stings your face, but you don't flinch.

You turn to your crew, their faces pale and etched with worry in the flashes of lightning. Your voice, when it comes, is not a roar to compete with the gale, but a steady, resonant command that cuts through the chaos.

"Alright, listen up! This is what we trained for! Mister Evans, take two men and double-check the lashings on the lifeboats. I will not lose them. Peters, you and your team to the bilge pumps—keep them clear and working. I want a report every five minutes. O'Malley, to the wheel with me. We'll steer into these swells, not away from them. We ride them out."

You see the shift in their eyes. The panic doesn't vanish, but it's met with purpose. They have orders. They have a task. They have a captain.

You grip the spinning wheel, O'Malley's strong hands beside yours, and you turn the bow directly into the next monstrous wave. It's not an act of defiance, but of understanding. You must meet the sea on its own terms.

And as the ship climbs the wall of black water, a strange thought enters your mind, a dreamer's knowledge surfacing through the persona of the captain: *This storm is not the enemy. It is the test. And we will pass.*
