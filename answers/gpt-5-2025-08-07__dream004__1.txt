and it is breathing. The surface rises and falls the way a quiet lake inhales at dawn. When you lean closer, you see no weave, no fibers—just a pale skin of possibility, thin as frost on a window.

There is no brush. When you look down, your hands are empty and then not: your fingers are stained with colors you cannot name, shades that taste like tangerine and thunder when you press them to your tongue. In this place you can’t remember how to speak, but you remember how to make a mark. You lift your hand, and the air thickens into bristles, soft as moth wings, gathering around your wrist like a patient animal. The first stroke you make is hesitant and it trembles, then steadies, humming the way a faraway power line hums on a hot day.

You decide to paint a horizon, because everything around you already refuses to keep one. You drag ultramarine across the canvas and it pools into a shore. The line doesn’t stay put—it ripples, nods, then stretches to meet the place your feet are standing. You feel the sand rise under your soles, fine grains like syllables spilling out of a mouth. The air smells briefly of rain on coin, then of tea steeped in pine needles, then of a city you visited once and cannot place.

You paint a door to go with the shore, an old habit of making exits before you need them. The door is simple, a rectangle with a knob that is a small quiet circle. On the canvas, it glows white, then bleeds into oak, then settles into the color of the part of an eye that is neither pupil nor iris, the in-between ring where storms live. When you reach out, your fingers meet wood as convincing as memory. You could open it. You don’t, not yet.

Instead, you draw a ladder. Not a ladder exactly—more like twelve notes held in the air, evenly spaced. When you step onto the first rung, a tone rings out, low and kind and a little surprised to see you. The ladder warbles as you climb and the notes become a song you swear you knew when you were small, about a fish that carried the moon on its back and never got tired.

At the top of the song-ladder there is a room painted the color of a closed eyelid. Outside, shapes bargain with each other, triangles dissolving into clouds, clouds clicking into cubes, cubes unraveling like knitting into a flock of pale birds. In here, everything pauses. The pause has weight—small, like a ceramic cup in your palm. When you blow on it, it cools.

The canvas is not where you left it. It follows you like a patient animal, or like a thought you haven’t finished thinking. It leans against nothing, tilts in a wind that doesn’t touch your hair. A thin crack has appeared in its surface, the way ice fractures in slow motion. From it seeps a wisp of color, not visible so much as felt—a sensation like remembering the first time you couldn’t fall back asleep.

You paint with your left hand now. You make a small boat with a high prow and a hull that is really a laugh turned sideways. Into the boat you place a stone for ballast, a stone that looks like a word you’ve been trying to say for years. The boat rocks, delighted to have a purpose. You set it on the painted shore and it skims off the canvas into the world, trailing a wake of tiny commas, pausing the colors as it goes.

On the horizon you laid down, the sun appears because you think it should. It lowers itself to the surface and floats there a while, then peels itself like an orange. Inside are clock seeds, each one ticking a different time: the moment you learned to ride a bike, the afternoon you found a feather that convinced you angels were possible, a Tuesday when you decided to call your father just to hear his voice. You plant one seed in the ground and time grows upward in thin golden blades. The blades brush against your ankles and slow your pulse until your heartbeat and the landscape agree.

You look back at the door. When you grasp the knob it is warm, like someone else just used it. On the other side, a library unfurls. The shelves are filled not with books but with shells, each a spiral of sound. The air tastes like dust and salt and papercuts. You pick up a shell the color of dawn on a winter street and hold it to your ear. It contains the sound of your own footsteps leaving somewhere you loved. You put it back gently and choose another. This one holds your grandmother’s humming, the part of the song where she never remembered the words and never needed them.

You feel watched, not by a person but by your outline. On the canvas, a figure has appeared that is unmistakably you, except the edges are softer, as if you’ve been gently erased. It lifts its hand the way you lift yours, but a fraction of a second before. The figure dips its fingers into the same colors and paints something you were about to think of: a thread, red and fine as a vein, tied to your smallest finger. The other end disappears into the painted distance.

You tug the thread and feel a tug in your chest, a quiet agreement. You understand: this is how you’ll find your way back.

You want to know if the world will obey you or if it will only ever collaborate. You test it. You draw a window and picture what should be outside: a field of tall grasses that gossip in the wind. The window opens to exactly that, but the grasses are made of letters from an alphabet you do not recognize. They brush against each other, making sentences you can almost read. You step through, let their punctuation tickle your knees. One blade curls against your leg in the shape of your name, not as you say it to others, but as you say it inside your own head when no one can hear.

Colors begin to slow, like a stirred pot settling. Shapes find brief agreement and hold. The sky decides on the color of a bruise healing. You realize you have been here for as long as it takes to draw a breath and for a lifetime and for a moment between raindrops. The canvas leans, patient. There is room for one more thing.

You kneel and paint a small door within the larger door, just big enough for a thought to pass through without being noticed. Around it you paint a ring of tiny pears that smell like laughter. Above it you write a word by not writing it: you leave its absence in the paint, a clean shape your eyes trip over and your mouth wants to speak.

The figure that is you nods, a gesture that feels like an oath. The red thread warms against your skin. From far away—the distance of across a room, across an ocean, across a life—you hear someone call your name. It is your voice. It is the person who will wake up soon, the you who will lift your head from a pillow and not be able to say why your fingers feel sticky with light.

You stand. The canvas folds itself into a boat the size of a hand and sails into a pocket of your coat you don’t remember having. The door you painted opens a sliver and lets out the smell of new paper and oranges and rain on hot stone. You step toward it, then through. For a moment you are all outline and then all color, and then you are simply a person holding a red thread that is only a feeling.

And the world of changing colors takes one last, careful breath with you, and lets you go.
