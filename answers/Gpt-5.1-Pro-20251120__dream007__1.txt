…and you decide to say the one thing you’ve been avoiding.

“I’m scared I’m going to lose you,” you blurt out.

The words fall between you like something heavy. Your friend’s mouth is still half-open, ready to fire back another point, but the next insult never comes. Their face shifts—anger softening into something more complicated: hurt, confusion, worry.

The room around you flickers.

You notice it now, how off everything is. The wall clock is melting down the side of the bookshelf, its numbers sliding like wet ink. The lamp in the corner hums in a low, musical way, cycling through colors that don’t exist in waking life. Your friend’s shirt keeps changing—red, then blue, then some pattern you can’t name.

You’re dreaming, you realize, with a sharp, quiet certainty.

Your friend keeps talking, but their words turn into little glowing symbols that float out of their mouth and drift toward the ceiling, where they burst like soap bubbles. You don’t understand the symbols, but you feel the meaning anyway: *You hurt me too. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to lose you either.*

You take a breath that feels bigger than your body.

“If this is a dream,” you say slowly, “then I don’t want to keep fighting. Not like this. What are we really arguing about?”

Everything pauses.

The room peels away like wallpaper. The walls roll up and vanish, and suddenly you’re both standing in the middle of a huge, empty train station. No people. No sound. Just tracks stretching out in every direction into fog.

Your friend is still there, but they look a little different now—like a blend of every version of them you’ve ever known. Younger. Older. The way they looked the day you met. The way they looked the first time you disappointed each other.

The argument topic, the “important thing,” swims back into focus in your mind: a choice. A path. Something about them leaving, or you leaving. Something about how your lives are pulling apart.

“This is about you going,” you say. “About you changing. About things not staying how I want them to stay.”

Your voice echoes through the station, bouncing off invisible walls.

A train glides in without a sound. Its doors open with a soft sigh. Each window shows a different scene: your friend laughing with new people, you in another city, unread messages, missed calls, long silences, occasional reunions. Some windows show you two hugging; some show you walking away from each other.

Your friend looks at you. “You can’t follow me everywhere,” they say. “You know that.”

“I know,” you answer, and you do. You really do. But knowing doesn’t make it hurt less.

You feel a tug—half emotional, half physical—pulling you toward the train, and another tug pulling you back to where you stand now. The dream seems to be waiting for you to choose.

You look at your friend, then at the train, then down at your own hands. Your fingers are flickering at the edges, as if you’re losing signal.

“What happens if I let you go?” you ask.

The station lights dim. Only your friend’s face is clear now.

“Try it and see,” they say gently.

So you do something you haven’t done in a long time, awake or asleep: you stop clinging. You loosen your mental grip. You picture your hand on a rope wrapped around them—and you open your fingers.

The rope dissolves.

The train doesn’t rush away dramatically. It just starts to move, slowly. Your friend steps onto it, but as they do, something strange happens: another version of them stays where they were, right beside you. One friend leaving, one friend remaining—a split that feels oddly true.

“You’re not really losing me,” says the one beside you. “You’re just losing the guarantee that everything stays the same.”

The train gathers speed, vanishing into the fog. The version of your friend who stayed slips their hand into yours for just a second—warm, solid.

“When you wake up,” they say, “you’re still going to be scared. That’s okay. Just… tell me. Tell the real me. Don’t wait until it turns into a fight.”

You open your mouth to answer, but the station starts to crack along invisible seams. Light streams through the gaps, bright and white and weightless. Your friend’s hand squeezes yours one last time, then slips away.

The scene shatters.

You find yourself back in the original room—the one from the start of the dream, mid-argument. Your friend’s face is red with frustration; their arms are folded. The clock on the wall is normal again. The lamp is just a lamp.

“…are you even listening to me?” they’re saying.

You feel that same big, dream-sized breath rise in your chest.

“Yeah,” you say quietly. “I am. And I’m scared I’m going to lose you.”

This time, the words aren’t dream symbols. They’re just words. Simple, vulnerable, real.

Your friend blinks, thrown off-script. The fight loses some of its sharpness. Their shoulders drop a fraction.

“Why didn’t you just say that?” they ask.

You don’t answer right away. Somewhere, deep in the back of your mind, you can still feel the echo of tracks stretching into fog, and a train disappearing into whatever comes next.

As that echo fades, you feel the edges of the dream blur. The room softens. Your friend’s voice becomes distant, and you know you’re about to wake up.

The last thing you feel before you surface into waking life is this: the warmth of your friend’s presence, and the sense that, even if things change, the connection between you is more flexible than you feared—and maybe strong enough to bend without breaking.
