You feel a storm approaching and the serene atmosphere shifts into one of tension and awe. The sky darkens as thick, ominous clouds roll in, blotting out the sun. A cool breeze turns into a gusty wind, rustling the leaves and causing the branches to sway violently. The air is charged with electricity, and you can hear the distant rumble of thunder echoing through the forest.

As you continue walking, the first drops of rain begin to fall, gently at first, then intensifying into a torrential downpour. The forest floor becomes slick with mud, and the scent of wet earth fills your senses. Lightning flashes across the sky, illuminating the trees in stark, dramatic silhouettes. The thunder crashes overhead, shaking the ground beneath your feet.

You seek shelter under a large, ancient tree, its thick canopy offering some protection from the rain. As you stand there, you notice the forest coming alive in a different way—streams form in the pathways, and the sound of rushing water mingles with the storm's symphony. The storm feels both terrifying and exhilarating, a reminder of nature's raw power.

Suddenly, the storm begins to ease. The rain slows to a drizzle, and the clouds start to part, revealing glimpses of a golden sunset. The forest, now glistening with raindrops, seems to breathe a sigh of relief. Birds begin to sing again, and the air is fresh and clean. You step out from under the tree, feeling a sense of renewal and wonder, as if the storm has washed away the old and made way for something new. The dream ends with you walking forward, the forest now bathed in the soft, warm light of the setting sun.
