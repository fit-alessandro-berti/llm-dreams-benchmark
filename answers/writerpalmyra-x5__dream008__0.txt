...realize the file names on your screen are in a language made of symbols that shift when you blink. Your boss’s voice echoes from inside a filing cabinet, saying, “We need it yesterday,” and your keyboard starts sprouting leaves.

But when you tap their shoulder, they wake up… speaking fluent dolphin.
