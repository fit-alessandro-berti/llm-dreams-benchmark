**Dream Continuation:**

As the competition progresses, you face various challenges—each one testing your skills, creativity, and resilience. The final round is a high-stakes presentation in front of a panel of industry leaders. You’ve prepared for weeks, but as you step onto the stage, your mind goes blank. The room feels colder, the lights brighter. Just as panic sets in, you notice a small, glowing object in your pocket—a strange, iridescent stone you found earlier in the competition.

Without thinking, you clutch it tightly. Suddenly, the words flow effortlessly. Your voice is steady, your ideas sharp. The judges lean in, captivated. When you finish, the room erupts in applause. The lead judge smiles and says, *"We’ve never seen anything like that. The job is yours."*

But as you reach out to shake their hand, the scene shifts. You’re no longer in the competition hall—you’re standing in a vast, empty field under a twilight sky. The stone in your hand pulses faintly. A voice whispers, *"This was only the first test."*

You wake up, heart pounding, wondering: *Was it just a dream… or something more?*

Would you like to explore where this dream could go next?
