# Lost in Time

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to adapt quickly to survive in what appears to be medieval times.

The morning air carries the scent of woodsmoke and something less pleasant—perhaps animal dung and unwashed bodies. You're lying on a pile of straw in what seems to be a small wooden structure. Sunlight filters through cracks in the walls, illuminating dancing dust particles.

Outside, you hear the clatter of wooden wheels on cobblestone, the lowing of livestock, and distant human voices shouting in what sounds like English, but strangely accented and peppered with unfamiliar words.

You realize you need to figure out the basic rules of this society before you draw unwanted attention. Your clothes are all wrong—modern fabrics and styles that would instantly mark you as foreign or worse, a witch or demon. Looking around the small hut, you spot rough-spun garments hanging from a peg—not particularly clean, but they'll help you blend in.

Your stomach growls painfully. When was the last time you ate? You need to find food, but you have no money—at least nothing that would pass for currency here. You'll need to trade labor for sustenance, but what skills do you have that would be valuable in a world without computers, electricity, or modern medicine?

As you step outside, the full reality of your situation hits you. The narrow, muddy street is lined with timber-framed buildings. People bustle about their morning routines—a woman empties a chamber pot from an upper window (you step back just in time), a blacksmith hammers at his forge, children chase a skinny dog between market stalls.

You realize you need to make a decision: try to find a way back to your time, or accept this new reality and build a life here? Either way, your first priority is clear—survival.
