...feel a bead of sweat trickle down my temple, cool against my skin but sending shivers of anxiety down my spine. "Tomorrow morning!" My boss's voice booms, jolting me awake. 

For a moment, I'm still breathless with the urgency of the dream. My empty bedroom seems to press in on me as I struggle to remember the impossible project, the details swirling like mist. Ah, yes, it comes back to me – a complete overhaul of the company's database, a task that would normally take months, needed to be finished by the end of the day.

My boss vanishes in a puff of imaginary smoke – a strange glitch in the dream, since he was a stern but very much corporeal man in my nightmare who stared at me with eyes that glowed like embers in a dying fire. "The Peterson Report!," I recall suddenly, my heart hammering against my ribs, even though I thought my pale, sweaty gaze at the calendar reflected upon real wouldn't scare me so much anymore.

Why was the Peterson Report suddenly back? It was massive! And I was already late for it. I looked over at the looming stack of paperwork on my desk. What started as a single document, a task I was attempting to do in my sleep, was suddenly a physical manifestation of my impending doom. Was this imaginary pressure going to seep into my real life too?

The problem wasn't just the report. He stepped in too close. I stumbled back from the imaginary deadline, back into the realm of wakefulness.

"Alright," I thought, slowly shaking off the sleep-induced panic. "The Petersons. I can't believe they pulled this deadline-

-focused nightmare of a boss out of my subconscious. Deep breaths, it's not real. It's just a dream."

Only to have my attention grabbed by another frighteningly loud whisper: "Peterson Report... due sunset..."

I woke up with a start. My alarm echoed its recurring "beep" but shifted from its normal soft chime to the low rasps of the phrase "The Peterson Report, due at sunset." It stabbed the stillness of the pre-dawn light.

Above me, above my paper-choked desk, I could still hear the echo of my boss's reminders.

Then, I remembered the impossible deadline from nowhere. "The Petersons... those government audits... always pushing the boundaries...", the thought died on my lips as I caught myself slipping into a fresh wave of panic, this time about the critically unmet deadlines of my waking life. The feeling of impending doom, of having a giant, looming log jammed across my path, wouldn't subside.

I had to get back at it. Twice today, I had slept through my alarm, causing me to wake up in a panic. My dreams always seemed to have a strange accuracy to my anxieties.

Suddenly, a solution dawned on me.

Maybe the report was going to be falling apart in my waking hours, not here. I quickly tell myself to relax and embrace the calmness of my unproductive morning hours.

The others are probably already awake.

I look out of the window and say to myself, "This couldn't be more accurate. I'm getting a caffeine fix right now, so I can start..." BUT a goodbye kiss, a sudden call to "Start making breakfast everyone!", my brain interrupts.  "One step at a time!", my mind urges me. "Focus on your waking life, don't let the anxieties of the dream take hold."

**You could say that I spent the majority of my waking life stressing about this, staring at the shadows cast by the setting sun as I struggled to finish this...** The work overdue list in my mind, like tasks in my death grip.

"It's due at sunrise?" someone asked nervously.

"You'd think if you knew me, you'd know my boss doesn't play by the rules," I mumbled through a sudden wave of exhaustion. This was my chance to stop letting my dreams dictate my waking life. Since the deadline for the "demented project" seemed inherently universe-shaking.

**"...falling apart. The Petersons don't just WANT to crack your brain, they DEMAND to be completed, your way out..."** I trail off, exhausted by the thought of everyone rushing to the door. I need more sleep, but everyone else is already there.

"...**is this their idea of a deadline? Is ALWAYS the case when deadlines are given to me, it's impossible.**"

All of a sudden, a heavy feeling washes over you. The weight of inadequacy induces a sense of pre-dawn fatigue in the waking moment. "Deadline" I  mumble as the pre-dawn calm fades away and the prompt feeling of wake-life for a moment, I suddenly realize...

The boss's voice is gone, replaced by researchers' whispers. "But... impossible is NOT real.

I give in," I reply to something not there, but suddenly feels very present in the cold slime of my waking reality.

You could say that your boss's nightmares start to bleed into mine. Like everyone's darkest fears being bundled together in that final push to meet whatever ridiculous demands were being levied.

I sigh, the weight of my own held-up work hanging heavy over me while the sun starts to peek through the curtains of the waking world.

"This time, I know what waits outside those doors," I say to the imaginary room

You are for the first time in a time, I replace "devastating,"

"...but one bigger than any we've ever seen."

I overcome the burdens of deadlines quickly forgotten too.
