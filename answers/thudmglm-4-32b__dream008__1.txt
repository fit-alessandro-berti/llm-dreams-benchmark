Okay, I'll continue the dream from there:

...you look at the mountain of tasks already piled on your desk and the vague, complex brief your boss just shoved at you. The deadline is tomorrow morning. Your mind goes completely blank. You feel a peculiar numbness spreading through your limbs, like you've been dipped in lukewarm jelly. Time seems to warp; the second hand on the clock on the wall is doing laps, yet the boss is breathing down your neck, demanding to know if you've even started.

The walls of the office seem to be closing in, pressing tighter and tighter. The ceiling rises higher and higher, becoming an impossible, unreachable expanse. The chair beneath you feels like it's melting into the floor. You fumble for a pen, but it's too large, like a thick tree branch. Documents swirl around you like leaves in a wind tunnel you can't feel.

You open your mouth to speak, to explaining the impossibility, but no sound comes out. Only a faint, buzzing whine, like being inside a large, ancient computer. The boss frowns, taps their watch, their face morphing into a mix of impatience and something else... almost sorrowful? Suddenly, you're not in the office anymore. You're lying on a beach, but the sand is made of sharp, glittering metal shards. The "ocean" is a swirling vortex of multicolored lights. And the impossible deadline deadline is now a giant, ticking clock floating right above your head, filling your entire vision. The ticking is so loud now, it vibrates through your very bones...
