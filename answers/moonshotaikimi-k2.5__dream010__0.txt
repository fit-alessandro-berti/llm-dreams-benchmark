 …and the walls breathe.

It starts ordinarily enough—a whiteboard session where I must code solutions in languages that haven't been invented yet, my fingers trailing light instead of ink. The judges sit in shadow, their faces rotating like温和的 moons, nodding only when I make mistakes. "Error is proximity," they whisper in unison.

The second challenge takes place underwater, though we're still in the conference room. I must present my five-year plan while drowning politely, bubbles rising from my mouth carrying words that transform into monarch butterflies mid-flight. My competitors—faceless silhouettes in tailored suits—crush them with Municipal binders, but I discover I can breathe through my palms, inhaling the chlorine scent of forgotten childhood summers.

By the third round, the building has rearranged itself into an M.C. Escher staircase. I carry a coffee cup that never empties, its liquid dark as oil and tasting of electricity. The task: organize an infinite filing cabinet containing every conversation I've ever had, including the ones that haven't happened yet. I find the drawer labeled "2027—The Argument About Grace" and slip a Post-it note inside that reads *I was wrong*, watching the future soften.

The半决赛 happens in a mirror. I interview myself, but the reflection is running three seconds ahead, answering questions before I ask them. We negotiate salary in units of starlight and regret. "Your weakness?" my reflection asks. "I confuse memory with prophecy," I admit, and the mirror cracks along that fault line, letting in a wind that smells of server rooms and old books.

The final challenge is simply a chair facing an open window.

There is no judge. There is no prompt. Outside, the sky scrolls through different seasons like a glitching screensaver—cherry blossoms, then snow, then the particular bruised-purple of an eclipse.

I sit.

The chair is warm. Someone was here before me, or will be. I realize, with the crystalline logic of dreams, that the competition never ended—it just became indistinguishable from the work itself. The dream job isn't a prize waiting at the finish line; it's the act of continuing to participate while understanding that the rules are liquid, the metrics are poetry, and the only winning move is to remain curious about what the next breath of the walls might bring.

I stand up, walk through the window—not breaking the glass but passing through it like mist—and wake up with the taste of electricity still coating my tongue, already reaching for a keyboard that hums with the frequency of almost-answers.
