…tiny runes that seem to pulse with a pale, inner light. Each swirl is different—some curling like tendrils of smoke, others sharp as shards of glass—yet they all flow together, forming a living, breathing tapestry across the box’s surface.

You press a fingertip to one of the circular sigils. The metal beneath your touch grows warm, and the runes rearrange themselves in a silent dance: spirals contracting, lines lengthening, and then—at the very center—a small keyhole materializes where there was none before. No ordinary key could turn it; you sense that this lock responds only to intention, memory, or perhaps the half-forgotten thoughts of your own dreaming mind.

Focusing, you search your memories for something precious enough to unlock it. The scent of rain on hot pavement. Laughter echoing down an empty hallway. The moment a childhood friend slipped you a secret note. As you summon each memory, the box responds, its patterns shifting to mirror your emotions—sometimes bright and playful, sometimes dark and tangled. Slowly, tentatively, you place your palm against the keyhole, imagining the note from your friend: “You are braver than you know.”

With that declaration, the lock clicks. The box creaks open to reveal…nothing but a mirror of polished obsidian. You lean in and see not your face, but a vast landscape: a moonlit desert, its dunes rippling like waves; a ruined city half-swallowed by vines; distant stars falling like teardrops. The mirror-image desert begins to swirl, pulling you forward, and you realize that opening the box was merely the beginning of another journey—a doorway into the deepest reaches of your own dream.

You step through the glass threshold, and the box’s lid closes silently behind you, sealing shut until the next traveler dares to unlock its secrets. As you walk across the shifting sands toward a horizon that gleams with impossible colors, you feel the thrill of endless possibility: this dream has only just begun.
