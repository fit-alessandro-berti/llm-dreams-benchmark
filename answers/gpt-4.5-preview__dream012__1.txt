grip the helm tightly, feeling the fierce wind and icy sea spray against your face. Even through the chaos, you sense your crew's unwavering trust, and their strength gives you courage. Trusting your instincts, you call reassuringly above the roaring wind, urging them to stay strong, hold fast, and remain united through the tempest.

Lightning streaks the sky, illuminating looming waves that rise like walls around your struggling vessel. Steering skillfully through the cresting tumult, you spot in the distant storm a faint glow—the steady beam of a lighthouse piercing through the darkness.

With renewed determination, you shout to your crew, "Steady, mates! Follow the light ahead!" They cheer back, bolstered by hope and unity. As you draw nearer, the sea gradually begins to calm—waves shrinking into gentle currents that guide you safely toward land.

The storm clouds part, revealing clear skies and a brilliant sunrise ahead. Your ship sails peacefully through radiant waters toward a new and welcoming harbor, where both ship and crew can at last rest and dream anew.
