Despite the hardships, you decide to *keep moving forward*, driven by a stubborn hope you can’t quite explain. 

You trek across cracked highways and through ghost towns swallowed by sand. Every now and then, you catch glimpses of old world echoes — a child’s toy half-buried in dust, a billboard for a long-forgotten concert, a car rusted into a skeleton of itself.

One evening, as the sun bleeds out across the broken horizon, you spot a faint light flickering in the distance — impossibly rare. Instinct says it could be a trap, but your heart says it could be *something else*.

You tighten the straps on your worn-out pack, grip the handle of your scavenged blade, and make your way toward it. As you draw closer, you realize it’s a lantern swinging gently from a doorway, casting a warm circle of gold. And inside the doorway...

You hear laughter.

Real, *human* laughter.

What do you do?
