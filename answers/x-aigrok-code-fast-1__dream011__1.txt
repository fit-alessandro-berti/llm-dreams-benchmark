...all in an ancient language you don't understand, but somehow you realize it's a test of wisdom, not rote knowledge. You panic momentarily, then notice a glowing pen on the desk that whispers hints in your ear. The first question translates roughly to: "Describe the moment you decided on this career path, but from the perspective of your future self."

As you scribble your answer, the room begins to warp—the walls turning into windows showing alternate lives you'd never lived. Question two: "Solve this riddle: What has keys but can't open locks? (Hint: It's not a piano.)"

The exam room fades into a vast library of dreams, where books float like clouds. Your score depends not on answers, but on the stories you create from them. You ace it, waking up with a clear vision of your true career, feeling invincible. You weren't dreaming after all—or were you?
