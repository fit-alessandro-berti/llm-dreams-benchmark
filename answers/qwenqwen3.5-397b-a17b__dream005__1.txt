...and the noise doesn't quite reach your ears. It vibrates in your chest instead, a low hum like a cello string bowed by a ghost.

The first group you pass is standing in a tight circle, passing a golden apple from hand to hand. When you brush past them, you realize the apple is made of glass and filled with ticking clockwork. No one looks at you, but you feel their attention like heat on your back.

You turn a corner, but the hallway stretches longer than the building should allow. The wallpaper shifts patterns as you glance at it—floral to geometric to something that looks like topographical maps of places you've never been.

Another group blocks the path. They are dressed in formal wear from different centuries; a woman in a 1920s flapper dress stands shoulder-to-shoulder with a man in a suit of polished plate armor. They are whispering a single word in unison, over and over, but the word changes every time you blink. *Stay. Go. Wait. Now.*

You begin to run, but your feet feel heavy, as if you are wading through deep sand. The person you are looking for is just ahead, wearing that distinct blue coat you recognize. You call out, but your voice comes out as a burst of bubbles.

When you finally reach out to touch their shoulder, they turn around, and their face is a smooth, featureless mirror. In the reflection of their face, you see yourself, but you are the one wearing the blue coat.

The mirror-person hands you a key made of ice. It burns your palm with cold. "You're the one who was waiting," they say, using your own voice.

The floor dissolves into mist. The cold on your hand lingers for a second, then fades into the warmth of your bedsheets as you open your eyes.
