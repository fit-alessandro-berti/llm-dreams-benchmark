...written in a language you've never seen before. The symbols seem to shift and dance on the page, sometimes resembling ancient hieroglyphs, other times looking like mathematical equations, but nothing you can actually read or understand.

You look around the examination room and see that all the other students are calmly writing away, their pens moving confidently across their papers. The instructor, a blurry figure at the front of the room, seems to be watching you expectantly.

Your heart starts to race. This is it - your future career hinges on this test, and you can't make sense of a single question. You reach for your pen, but your hands are trembling. The paper in front of you feels impossibly blank.

Just as panic begins to set in, you notice something strange: even though you can't read the questions, images are starting to form in your mind. Each symbol seems to be communicating with you in a way that bypasses language entirely. You begin to understand concepts that feel both foreign and deeply familiar...

What happens next in your dream?
