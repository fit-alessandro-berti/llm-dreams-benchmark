You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend, Liam. The disagreement is about something important to both of you – the direction of our band. We’ve been playing together since high school, and we’re finally getting some traction, playing bigger gigs, writing better songs. But Liam wants to lean *hard* into a polished, radio-friendly sound, synth-heavy and predictable. I want to stay raw, experimental, keep the grit that made us, *us*. 

“It’s called growing up, Maya!” Liam was saying, his face flushed, pacing the cramped rehearsal space. “We can’t keep playing dingy bars to twenty people! We need to think bigger, reach more people!”

“Reaching more people by becoming…generic?” I retorted, my voice tight. “That’s not growth, Liam, that’s selling out! We’re not a pop band, we’re…we’re something different!”

The air crackled with frustration. We’d been going around in circles for an hour, each point met with a counterpoint, each attempt at understanding dissolving into accusations. I felt a familiar ache in my chest, the one that came with knowing this could fracture something precious. 

I decide to… **stop talking.**

Not in a dramatic, storm-out kind of way. Just…stop. Mid-sentence, I clamp my mouth shut. I take a deep breath, and instead of firing back another argument, I walk over to my drum kit. 

Liam stops pacing, staring at me, bewildered. “Maya? What are you doing?”

I don’t answer. I sit down, pick up my sticks, and start to play. Not a song we’ve rehearsed, not a polished, radio-ready beat. I start with a slow, deliberate rhythm, a heartbeat pulse on the bass drum. Then I add a complex, syncopated pattern on the snare, layering in subtle cymbal washes. It’s the kind of drumming that feels like falling through water, a little unsettling, a little beautiful. 

It’s the sound of *us*. The sound of the late-night jams, the messy experimentation, the feeling of creating something from nothing. 

I don’t look at Liam. I just play. The music fills the room, pushing back against the tension. It’s not a plea, not an apology, not a concession. It’s a statement. A reminder. 

Slowly, almost imperceptibly, Liam stops looking angry. He starts to tap his foot. He reaches for his guitar, not to argue, but to listen. Then, tentatively, he starts to play along. A simple, echoing melody at first, then a more complex counterpoint to my rhythm. 

The music builds, not into a polished song, but into a conversation. A wordless dialogue between two friends, trying to find their way back to each other through the language they both understand. 

The rehearsal space feels different now. The heat hasn’t completely dissipated, but it’s transformed. It’s no longer the heat of anger, but the heat of creation. 

And as we play, I realize I wasn’t trying to *win* the argument. I was trying to remind us both what we were fighting *for*.



Then, the music starts to warp. The notes stretch and bend, becoming distorted and echoing. The rehearsal space begins to dissolve around the edges, the walls blurring into a swirling vortex of color. Liam’s guitar fades into a static hum. I try to grip my drumsticks tighter, but they feel like they’re slipping through my fingers. 

A voice, not Liam’s, whispers in my ear, “The music is the key…but what door does it open?”



And then I wake up, the echo of the drums still vibrating in my chest.
