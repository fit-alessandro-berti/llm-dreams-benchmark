**Dream Continuation:**

You hesitate at first, your fingers curling into the fabric of your coat as the weight of your loneliness presses down like a heavy fog. But something in their eyes—warm, unguarded, *real*—makes you nod. The strangers form a loose circle around you, their voices overlapping like a chorus:

*"We know this place,"* says a woman with silver-streaked hair, her hands steady as she adjusts the strap of a well-worn satchel. *"It’s easy to get turned around here. The streets shift when you’re not looking."*

A lanky man in a patched-up overcoat grins, tapping his temple. *"Trick is to follow the music. Always follow the music."* He tilts his head, and suddenly, you *hear* it—a distant, wavering melody, like a music box playing underwater. It pulls at something deep in your chest, a memory you can’t quite name.

The group moves as one, guiding you through the labyrinth of neon-lit alleys and cobblestone squares. The city around you *breathes*: buildings lean in to whisper secrets, streetlamps flicker in Morse code, and the air smells like rain on hot pavement and something sweet, like caramelized sugar. A child with too-bright eyes skips ahead, leaving a trail of glowing footprints that vanish as quickly as they appear.

*"Where are we going?"* you ask, your voice smaller than you intended.

The silver-haired woman smiles. *"Where you need to be. But first—"* She stops in front of a narrow door, its paint peeling in the shape of a crescent moon. *"—you have to choose."*

The door has no handle. Only a keyhole shaped like a question mark.

The lanky man nudges you forward. *"Go on. It’s yours to open."*

Your hand trembles as you reach out. The moment your fingers brush the wood, the door *sighs*, and the keyhole fills with liquid gold. The melody swells, and the city holds its breath.

Then—

The door swings inward.

Beyond it, the world *unfolds*.

**How would you like to continue?**
- **Option 1:** The door opens into a version of the city you’ve always known—but *wrong*. Your childhood home stands where the skyscrapers should be, and a younger version of yourself waves from the window.
- **Option 2:** The threshold leads to a vast, star-studded library where every book is a door to another dream. The silver-haired woman hands you a volume with your name on the spine.
- **Option 3:** The moment you step through, the strangers vanish, and you realize *you* were the guide all along—they were fragments of your own mind, leading you home.
- **Option 4:** (Your own idea—describe it!)

*(Dreams are yours to shape. Where does this one take you?)*
