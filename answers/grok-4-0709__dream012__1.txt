... steady yourself on the rain-slicked deck, gripping the wheel with white-knuckled hands. The wind howls like a chorus of forgotten sirens, whipping salt spray into your eyes, and lightning fractures the sky into jagged shards of electric blue. Your crew— a ragtag bunch of shadowy figures, some with faces that shift like melting wax, others with eyes glowing like distant lighthouses— huddle around you, their voices a murmur of pleas and prayers. "Captain, what do we do?" one cries, his beard turning into writhing tentacles as he speaks.

You open your mouth to bark orders, but instead of words, a flock of iridescent birds erupts from your throat, swirling into the storm and pecking at the thunderclouds. The ship lurches violently, waves crashing over the bow like the fists of an angry giant. You remember, in that hazy dream-logic way, that this isn't just any ship— it's made of memories, planks of old regrets and sails woven from childhood wishes. As the storm intensifies, the mast begins to bend, not breaking but blooming into a massive tree, its branches reaching for the stars peeking through the tempest.

"Steady on!" you finally shout, and your voice echoes back from the waves, multiplying into a harmonious choir. You spin the wheel, and suddenly the ship isn't sailing anymore— it's diving, plunging beneath the surface into an underwater realm where the storm is muffled, replaced by bioluminescent jellyfish drifting like living lanterns. The crew transforms too: one becomes a mermaid with scales of gold, another a wise old octopus ink-scribbling maps on the hull. Down here, the turbulence feels like a lullaby, and you realize the real storm was always inside you— fears and doubts churning like whirlpools.

But as you glide through coral palaces and forgotten shipwrecks, a colossal shadow looms ahead: a whale the size of a mountain, its eye a swirling vortex pulling you in. Do you steer toward it, embracing the unknown, or turn back to the surface where the storm still rages? The choice hangs in the watery silence, and just as you decide... you feel the dream shifting, the edges blurring, pulling you toward wakefulness. What happens next?
