**Dream Continuation:**

As your fingers brush the intricate patterns—a labyrinth of shimmering celtic knots interwoven with constellations—the grooves pulse faintly, as if breathing. The metal warms beneath your touch, and a low hum resonates, vibrating in your bones. One symbol, a spiral etched with star-like points, glows gold. Compelled, you trace it clockwise. 

The box shudders, layers sliding apart like petals. Inside, a prismatic mist swirls, condensing into a liquid mirror. Your reflection stares back, but older, wearier, clutching a dagger dripping with starlight. Behind them, a fractured city floats in a void. The image shifts: now a child (you?) planting a seed in cracked earth, which sprouts into a tree with roots that pierce the box’s sides, snaking up your arms. 

The wood blooms into your skin. You feel the tree’s memories—a thousand lifetimes branching, choices unmade. The box crumbles to ash, but the roots pull you *downward*, through the floor, into a cavern where a door of ice and flame waits. A voice echoes, *“You’ve carried the key all along.”* 

You wake with a gasp, your palms tingling, half-expecting vines or stardust. But the dream’s truth lingers: the patterns are now etched in your mind, a map to somewhere—or some*when*—else.
