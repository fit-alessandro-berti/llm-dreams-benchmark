You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and keep getting borrowed by their gravity. The room is large enough to have weather. The air does that thing where it remembers rain.

Near the coat check, a cluster compares what they keep in their pockets. They spill out small lives onto a linen-covered table: ticket stubs to places that never existed, a coin stamped with a ship that has never sailed, the tab from a can you swear you’ve already thrown away. Someone hands you a key shaped like a question mark and asks if it’s yours. You say, “It could be,” and they nod like you’ve passed a test without knowing you were taking one.

In the main hall, a chandelier drips light that refuses to fall. People laugh in crescendos, the way waves laugh when the moon shows off. You say the person’s name under your breath to keep it from escaping. Across a sea of strangers, you catch a flash of a red scarf. It is her scarf, or his, or theirs; your certainty changes with the music. You follow the red like a thread thrown into a maze.

There is a group practicing introductions with a bowl of names. They draw slips and become whoever they get for the next five minutes. A woman with twelve thin bracelets says your name exactly the way you forgive it. Everyone claps. You draw a name you can’t look at directly and drop it back into the bowl as if it is lit coal. No one notices; or they notice and fold their eyes around your privacy.

The music seems to come from under the rugs. You keep almost kneeling to hear it better. Instead you push through a swinging door into the kitchen, where the party’s heartbeat lives. It’s all steam and stainless steel. The line cooks speak to one another the way swallows talk in the evening. Your seventh-grade science teacher is there chopping parsley, himself and not, and he hands you an unmarked jar. The label says Time because of course it does. You sprinkle a little into a pan and everyone pretends it isn’t the best smell they’ve known.

On your way back out, you find a small terrace where people look inward with telescopes pointed at nothing. They have arranged deck chairs like a constellation they all remember differently. “Which star is yours?” they ask. You point to the slice of lemon floating in someone’s drink. They nod. “There’ll be a comet tonight,” someone says. “It irons names.” A moth smudges itself against a porch light. The air tastes like a story you’ve forgotten halfway through telling.

The scarf flares again, far away in the wall mirror. You make your way toward it and arrive somewhere else: a room where three old women sit threading needles with impossible precision. “What are you mending?” one asks, not looking up. You glance down. Your sleeve is split neatly at the elbow. You don’t remember this happening. The oldest threads a needle and hands it to you. “Careful,” she says. “If you look away, you’ll sew yourself into the tear.” You stitch until wool becomes wool again and, when you look up, they’re gone. On the chair sits a red thread, long and patient, leading out the door.

You pick it up and the party rearranges into a corridor that suits a line. You pass rooms that feel like memories tried on for size. A library where the books hum in their sleep. A lounge in which a man exhales small, gray birds that land on the backs of chairs and pretend to be patterns in the upholstery. Portraits look like you from angles your face doesn’t have. Each room is a question you don’t have to answer. The thread goes in one side and out the other, uninterested in your doubt.

Back in the main ballroom, the chandelier has given up pretending to be ice and is simply light. The floor vibrates with dance. Music shows itself briefly as a pale ribbon between musicians and dancers, tying and untying knots you recognize from your own hands. On the far side: the red scarf again, the shoulder you would know anywhere, even in a different life. You move toward it and the floor slides a fraction slower than your feet, so the distance rearranges itself, polite but stubborn.

Halfway across, you get stopped by a group all holding the same drink at different heights. “Have you met the host?” one of them asks, using your exact voice. “You’ll leave without seeing the host,” another says. You tell them you’re looking for someone else. They arrange their faces into a compassion that doesn’t get in your way. You say the person’s name and the room listens. Light dims in approval. A door opens where there was definitely a wall.

It’s a small room, a kindness disguised as a space. There’s one chair, and the person you’ve been trying to find is sitting in it. The red scarf is ordinary up close; you can’t believe how much work it did from far away. Their face is exactly and not exactly as you remember it from a day you can’t place. Relief opens in you like a window that had been painted shut.

“Hello,” you say, your voice the right size this time.

They pat the second chair you hadn’t noticed. “I thought you’d never get past the part with the keys,” they say, fondly, as if you both know this party already. You sit. The chair remembers you. The door pulls itself mostly closed. Outside, the party keeps behaving like weather you can choose to walk into.

You tell them there were a lot of rooms. They nod. “There always are.” You confess you almost forgot why you came. “That’s part of coming,” they say. You touch the scarf to make sure it doesn’t vanish. It feels like the temperature of decisions.

“Why didn’t you just stand somewhere obvious?” you ask. “Why all this…thread?”

“So you’d see what else was here,” they say, not unkindly. “Threads don’t care which way you travel them. They just do their work.”

You think about pockets and names, comets with irons, the sound under rugs. You think about how everything worth finding in your life has arrived via a side door. You think, briefly, of waking and how it always happens at the mouth of a sentence.

“Can I stay?” you ask. You mean in the chair, in the room, in the relief.

“You can,” they say. “But if you do, the piano will pour itself through the keyhole and the lampshade will learn the words to your name. It’s a stubborn party. Besides, you came to remember you could find me.”

The spoon-on-glass sound starts somewhere far away, and the hush moves through the house like a long animal deciding where to lie down. You recognize the shape of the moment that always tosses you out of a dream. It looks like a toast about to happen.

You stand. The chair sighs approval. They untie the red scarf and wind it around your wrist, not your neck. “For next time,” they say, and the knot is a small, correct promise.

When you open the door, everything has been patiently waiting without caring you were gone. The chandelier is a galaxy pretending not to know it. The music brushes your sleeve like a cat. A stranger you’ll never meet again is telling the exact truth to someone who will misunderstand them on purpose, and it is all beautiful and fine. You move through, and rooms recognize you the way tide recognizes shore.

At the coat check, you give the question-mark key back but keep it, somehow. “This one’s mine,” you say. The clerk smiles like he knows all keys are always eventually. Someone calls your name from a distance that is shorter than it sounds. It could be the person you came for. It could be the idea of them. It could be the house. You turn toward it and see, briefly, a hallway unspooling like a red thread into an ordinary night.

Glasses touch glass. The hush leaps. The party chooses its next shape without you, or with you, depending on how you wake. You wake the way you always do: with the feeling that a door somewhere just decided to be a door. Your wrist remembers a knot that may or may not be there. You remember that you can find them, next time, by starting anywhere.
