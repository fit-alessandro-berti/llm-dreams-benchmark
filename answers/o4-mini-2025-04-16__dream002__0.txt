You feel the air turn electric as a low rumble echoes through the trees. A sudden gust whips your hair; leaves and pine needles spiral around your ankles. The sky, once a gentle blue, has deepened to an unnatural gray, billowing inward like storm-tossed sails.

You lift your face and taste the first cold raindrops—sharp on your tongue, urgent. The wind presses you forward, urging you deeper into the forest. Ancient pines groan overhead as thunder cracks like a whip, and you realize you’re no longer simply walking—you’re running, heart pounding in time with the storm’s drum.

Ahead, a clearing opens. In its center stands a colossal oak whose bark glows faintly silver in the flashes of lightning. Drawn to it, you step beneath its vast canopy. Raindrops bead on its leaves, twinkling like stars in the sudden darkness. A hollow at its base reveals a carved wooden door, half-hidden in moss and lichen.

Despite the wind’s roar, you feel calm. The door swings open before you can touch it, beckoning with soft golden light. You step inside—and the storm’s fury falls away. Warmth floods your skin. The air smells of honey and something indefinably ancient.

In the center of this secret chamber floats a small orb of pale blue light. It pulses in time with your heartbeat, as if it knows you. You reach out; the moment your fingers brush its surface, the orb dissolves into tendrils of light that coil around you, weaving into your hair, your clothes, your very bones. Memories—some you’ve forgotten, some you’ve never lived—flicker through your mind: childhood laughter in sunlit meadows, nights spent gazing at distant stars, kindnesses given and received.

The tendrils of light draw tight, and with a final pulse, they retreat—leaving you hollow, but filled. As you turn back toward the door, the storm has vanished. Moonlight filters through the trees, cool and serene. You step out of the oak’s embrace and find yourself back at the forest’s edge, the orb’s warmth lingering like a heartbeat in your chest.  

You awake—or do you? Outside your window, the wind still whispers through the leaves, and in your hand, a single silver oak leaf trembles with a soft, inner glow.
