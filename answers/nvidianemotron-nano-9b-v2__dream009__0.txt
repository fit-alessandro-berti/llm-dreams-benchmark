You realize you need to find a way back to your own time. The air smells of damp earth and woodsmoke, and the only sounds are the rustle of leaves and distant animal calls. You notice a strange, ancient stone archway half-buried in the forest, its carvings glowing faintly with an otherworldly light. Curious, you approach it, and as you touch the carvings, a vision flashes in your mind: a map of a hidden portal, etched in a language you don’t recognize. 

Suddenly, a group of locals—a farmer, a child, and an elderly woman—appear, their faces a mix of fear and fascination. They speak in a language you don’t understand, but the child points toward the archway, whispering something that seems to translate in your mind: *“The key is in the river.”* 

You follow their guidance, navigating a treacherous path through the woods to a murky river. There, you find a weathered key shaped like a crescent moon, half-buried in the mud. When you insert it into the archway, it hums and opens, revealing a swirling portal of light. But as you step through, the world around you begins to dissolve—your dream is unraveling, and you’re pulled back into the familiar hum of your own era, waking up with a lingering sense of wonder and a question: *Was it real, or just a dream?*
