feel your heart pounding in your chest. You take a few deep breaths to calm your nerves and remind yourself of the message you want to convey. You begin with a warm greeting to the audience, thanking them for coming and for giving you the opportunity to share your thoughts. As you speak, you notice the audience becoming more engaged, nodding in agreement and responding to your points. You feel more confident with each passing moment, as if the words are pouring out of you effortlessly. When you finish, there is a moment of stunned silence, followed by a thunderous applause. You look out at the smiling faces of your audience, feeling a deep sense of satisfaction.

But then suddenly, the audience begins to morph and change. The friendly faces become twisted and grotesque, their smiles turning into sinister grins. You try to stop speaking, but the words keep coming out of your mouth, even as the audience begins to laugh mockingly. You feel a sense of dread wash over you, and suddenly you wake up drenched in sweat.

Phew, it was just a dream!
