**Dream Continuation:**

As the strangers beckon you forward, the cacophony of the city softens into a rhythmic hum. Their faces blur into shifting constellations, glowing faintly as if lit from within. Without speaking, they guide you down an alley painted in murals of stormy seas and fractured bridges—scenes from your own unspoken fears. One stranger hands you a compass, its needle spinning wildly before anchoring to a pulsing light in the distance.  

You follow, and the streets morph: skyscrapers twist into ancient trees, neon signs bloom into fireflies, and the pavement cracks open beneath your feet, revealing a river shimmering with liquid starlight. The strangers dissolve into the air, but their laughter lingers, echoing, *"You’ve carried the map all along."*  

A door appears, etched with your initials. When you touch it, the city folds into a paper crane in your palm. You wake, not to the relief of sunrise, but to the gentle certainty that loss is just motion—and every step, even in dreams, is a way home.
