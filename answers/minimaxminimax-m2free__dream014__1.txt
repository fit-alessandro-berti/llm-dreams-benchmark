I feel the city’s body around me—steel ribs and glass skin, breathing in lightning and exhaust. A group of kind strangers steps forward from the rush, smiling like doors opening. One offers a map that looks like it was drawn from warmth, not paper. “We’ll walk with you,” they say, and suddenly the noise becomes not a wall but a current.

They ask where I’m trying to go, and I don’t know the name. “To myself,” I almost say, but instead I describe the feeling I carry in my ribcage: a narrow lane with a teal door, the smell of cinnamon, a bird-shaped clock. They trade glances like hands passing something unseen. “We know a way,” one says. “You’re not alone in this maze.”

We move like a small constellation through avenues that refuse to be straight. A woman with a scarf points to a stairwell that spirals like a whisper. A man with paint-stained fingers nods toward a mural of someone who looks exactly like me. “This city is a rumor,” he laughs. “It works if you believe the good parts.”

Some turns are quick, some slow. We pass a shop where the owner slices mango and presses it into our palms, free. We pass a musician who plays a tune that feels like rain learning to walk. At each choice, we pause, listen to one another, and then step forward together. When I hesitate, a stranger touches my shoulder lightly. “You’ll know,” they say, “the moment your heartbeat matches the street.”

We cross a bridge where the river below shines like poured silver, and the wind lifts the pages of the map until they’re blank again. “That’s normal,” someone laughs. “The city is a living thing. It updates.”

Then we turn down a quiet lane. There it is: the teal door. The scent of cinnamon, the bird-shaped clock ticking the same half-second I hold my breath. The stranger beside me smiles, the exact angle of my relief. “We’re not your destination,” they say, “but we helped you find it.”

We sit on the curb. The city keeps moving; we don’t. Someone presses a paper flower into my hand. “For later,” they say. We split up like a flock that’s finished its job, headed to pockets of light that are both places and kinds of friendships. I open the door and step inside. The room is smaller than the space I was trying to reach, but it fits exactly. I leave the door open. Outside, the city keeps whispering routes to those who listen. Inside, it is quiet as a secret. I am not lost. I am found.
