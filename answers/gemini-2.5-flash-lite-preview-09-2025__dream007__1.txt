You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **walk away, not in anger, but with a profound, almost dizzying sense of futility, as if the words themselves are dissolving into the air around you.**

As you turn to leave, the argument, the room, and your friend don't fade; they **crystallize.** The outlines of the furniture become sharper, the colors too bright, and your friend's face, mid-sentence, freezes into a perfect, silent mask of frustration.

You take one step, and the ground beneath you **softens, becoming like cool, wet sand.** Your feet sink slightly, but you don't slow down. You keep walking, the frozen scene of the argument shrinking behind you until it’s a small, perfectly detailed diorama encased in a sphere of glass.

You look down at your hands. They are **translucent, shimmering slightly with an internal, pale blue light.** You realize you are no longer in the apartment where the fight happened, but standing on a vast, echoing plain made entirely of polished obsidian. Above, the sky is not black or blue, but a slow, swirling vortex of every color you’ve ever seen simultaneously—a symphony of silent light.

You start to run across the obsidian plain, not to escape, but because you feel an irresistible pull toward the horizon. With every stride, your feet make no sound, but instead, they leave behind **small, temporary constellations** that wink out a second after you pass over them.

As you reach the crest of a gentle slope, you see what you were running toward: **a single, enormous, stationary wave.** It's made not of water, but of pure, solidified silence. It hangs motionless in the air, stretching miles high, its crest catching the impossible light of the swirling sky.

Drawn forward, you walk toward the base of the Silent Wave. As you touch the surface, it doesn't feel solid or liquid; it feels like the **moment just before you remember something important.** You press your hands against it, and the blue light in your own body intensifies.

Suddenly, the wave doesn't crash, it **unfurls.** It opens up like a massive, slow-motion curtain, revealing what lies behind it:

**Your friend.**

But this friend is not frozen or angry. They are standing in a simple, sunlit field filled with tall, swaying grass that whispers in a language you can almost, but not quite, understand. They look over their shoulder, their expression soft, relieved, and entirely knowing.

They don't speak. Instead, they **reach out a hand, and in their palm rests the single, original cause of the argument,** which now appears small, insignificant, and completely beautiful—perhaps a perfect, iridescent feather, or a smoothly worn river stone.

As you reach for it, the light fades, the grass stills, and the overwhelming sensation is not resolution, but a deep, comforting **understanding that the argument was never about the stone at all.**

You wake up just as your fingers brush theirs, the quiet clarity of the dream clinging to you like morning mist.
