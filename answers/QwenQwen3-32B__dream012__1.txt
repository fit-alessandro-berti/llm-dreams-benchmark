You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you bellow orders over the howling wind, your voice a jagged blade cutting through the chaos. The *Eboncurrent* lurches like a living thing, its timbers groaning as waves claw at the deck. A crewmember is swept overboard—a young boy, no older than sixteen, his cry swallowed by the thunder. Guilt flares in your chest, but there’s no time to grieve.  

A flash of lightning reveals the problem: the main mast is split, splinters raining down as the wind funnels through the breach. The ship is a splintering tomb if you don’t act. Your first mate, a woman with one eye and a temper as fierce as the sea, grabs your arm. “We need to cut the sail *now*, or she’ll capsize!” But as you reach for the knife, the storm *shifts*. The clouds part briefly, revealing a moonlit archipelago ahead—impossible, unless the maps were lying.  

Then you see them: figures on the shore. Not humans, but tall, willow-like beings with skin of kelp and eyes like deep-sea pearls. They’re waving, or maybe warning you. The crew freezes. Is this a hallucination? A ghostly guide? Your hand hovers over the knife. To cut the sail is to surrender to the storm; to follow the shore is to risk the unknown.  

You choose.  

The moment the blade falls, the sea *sighs*. The storm’s rage eases, but the hull scrapes over hidden reefs, and the crew whispers that the ship is no longer made of wood, but of bone. The captain, drenched and trembling, realizes the dream was never about surviving the storm—it was about choosing which madness to embrace.  

As dawn breaks, the crew vanishes one by one, singing in tongues you’ve never heard. You wake alone on the deck, salt crusting your skin, the horizon now a door. And you know, with perfect clarity, that this is only the beginning.
