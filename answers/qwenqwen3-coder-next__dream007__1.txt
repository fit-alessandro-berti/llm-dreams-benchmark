…stop mid-sentence.

The words hang in the air like smoke—sharp, acrid, almost visible. Your friend’s face flushes, eyes wide with hurt or fury (it’s hard to tell in dreams, where emotions bleed into the scenery), and their hand clenches at their side. You realize, in that suspended breath, that you’re both speaking *past* each other—not listening, just preparing your next rebuttal.

So, before the next удар (I don’t know why I chose that word, but it echoes in my bones like a strike), you do something unexpected.

You kneel.

Not in surrender—but in sudden, impossible reverence. Your knees press into the cool, moss-covered stone floor of the memory-choir (yes, the dream has *name* now: the Memory-Choir Hall, vaulted ceiling of whispering parchment, shelves of old letters that glow faintly with unspoken truths). You look up—not up at your friend, but *past* them, toward the high window where moonlight bleeds in, silver and quiet.

“I’m sorry,” you say, voice rough but steady, “I’m not here for victory. I’m here because I still love you. And if we’re going to argue about X… then let’s argue *about* X—not *at* each other.”

A long silence. Then—the sound of a door creaking open nearby. Not the hall’s door. A *different* one. One that wasn’t there a moment ago. Your friend’s posture shifts. The anger doesn’t vanish, but it softens at the edges, like frost melting under a shared breath. They take a step toward you, not away.

Then they pull a small, cracked ceramic bowl from their coat pocket—the same one you both buried as kids, filled with collected rainwater, dried lavender, and a promise written in pencil.

“We buried it in the old oak,” they murmur. “But the roots grew around it. It’s still *alive*.”

And just like that—the argument dissolves—not into resolution, but into a deeper understanding: love isn’t agreement. It’s choosing the bowl. Passing it back.

The dream shifts. Now you’re both walking barefoot through a field of silent crickets, the bowl cradled between your palms like a shared heartbeat.

What do you want to do next?
