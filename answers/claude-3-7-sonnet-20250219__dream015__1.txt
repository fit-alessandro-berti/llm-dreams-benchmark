# The Gardener's Dream

You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to plant a garden.

It begins with a handful of seeds you discovered in an abandoned hardware store—tomatoes, beans, and sunflowers. The packet dates are from before everything fell apart. You're not sure if they'll even sprout, but something compels you to try.

You clear a patch of earth behind the concrete shelter you've claimed as home. The soil is poor, but you mix in compost from food scraps you've been collecting. Each seed goes into the ground with a whispered hope.

Days pass. You ration your dwindling supplies and defend your territory from desperate scavengers. But each morning, you check the garden first. When the first green shoots appear, you weep.

Word spreads. Others come—not to steal, but to see. A child brings you a jar of rainwater. An old woman offers potato eyes she's been saving. A man with a limp brings fertilizer he made from fish bones.

The garden grows beyond your patch. It spreads across the ruins, vines climbing broken walls, fruit trees taking root in cracked pavement. People begin to gather, to help, to share.

You dream of tomatoes warm from the sun, of community meals, of teaching children to save seeds. In this broken world, you've planted something more than vegetables—you've planted hope.

And in your dream within a dream, you see the world healing, one seed at a time.
