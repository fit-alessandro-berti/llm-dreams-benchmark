You reach out and touch it. The surface feels like cool water, yet solid beneath your fingertips. As you trace your hand across the empty expanse, colors begin to bloom wherever you make contact—deep crimsons that ripple outward like sonar, triangles that melt into circles, spirals that climb toward a sky that is no longer sky but a shifting gradient of impossible hues.

You realize the canvas is not blank. It has been waiting.

Shapes from the landscape around you start to pull toward the canvas—the molten clock from the distant mountains drifts overhead and imprints itself in gold. The floating stairs you crossed earlier leave their geometric echo in shadow. A river of violet light that sang to you in a language you almost understood weaves its serpentine path across the surface.

You understand now: this is not your canvas. It is *the* canvas. The place where this dream remembers itself.

You pick up a brush that materialized in your hand—it feels like holding a beam of moonlight. As you dip it into the colors swirling at the canvas's edge, the world around you pauses, holding its breath.

What will you paint into existence? Another door? A memory you'd forgotten? Or perhaps... yourself, looking back?

The brush hovers. The dream waits.
