...blank. Not just the paper—the screen, the whiteboard, the air itself is a void of pure, unblemished white. Panic claws at your throat, cold and sharp. You look down at your hands, gripping the exam pencil so tightly your knuckles are white. The proctor, a figure whose face you can never quite focus on, glides past your desk. Their footsteps don't make a sound, but you feel a vibration in your bones.

You try to write your name, to anchor yourself in this terrifying emptiness, but the pencil tip skitters across the page, leaving no mark. It's like trying to write on glass with ice. The silence in the room deepens, becoming a physical pressure against your eardrums.

"Begin," a voice whispers, not from the proctor, but from inside your own head.

The blankness shimmers. Slowly, like ink bleeding into water, words begin to form. But they aren't academic questions. They are questions you've asked yourself in the dead of night.

*What is the one thing you are most afraid of losing?*

*Describe the taste of a memory you'd give anything to forget.*

*If you could change one choice you've made, would you, and what would you sacrifice to do it?*

The questions keep coming, personal, invasive, and impossible. There are no multiple-choice answers, no equations to solve. There is only the stark, terrifying vulnerability of the page and the growing certainty that this exam isn't about what you know, but who you are. And you have no idea if your answer is good enough.
