…reach for your keyboard, but the keys are blank—smooth, pale squares like tiny sugar cubes. When you press one, it makes the sound of a distant elevator chime, and the monitor fills with a single sentence you don’t remember typing:

**DUE: YESTERDAY.**

Your boss stands behind you, perfectly still, holding a paper cup of coffee that never steams. Their eyes don’t blink. The office around you is your office—mostly. The carpet is the same, but it ripples like a shallow pond when you shift your chair. The fluorescent lights hum in a language you almost understand.

“Just start,” your boss says.

You try to speak, but your throat is full of printer paper. You swallow, and a stapled packet slides down your chest like an elevator going too fast. The cover page reads:

**PROJECT: BUILD A BRIDGE FROM NOW TO THEN.**

You flip it open. The pages are blank except for a faint watermark of your own signature, repeated like a pattern. Your name, over and over, already agreeing to whatever you haven’t done.

Your hands move anyway. You drag a file onto the desktop, and it lands with the weight of a stone. The file icon looks like a tiny door. When you double-click it, the door opens—not on the screen, but on the wall beside your desk.

Inside is a long corridor of filing cabinets. Each drawer is labeled with a year of your life. The handles gleam, cold and familiar. Somewhere in the distance, a phone rings with the exact cadence of your heartbeat.

Your boss leans closer. “The deadline,” they say, as if that explains everything.

You step into the corridor. The air smells like toner and rain. You pull open a drawer labeled **NEXT WEEK** and find it stuffed with calendars, all set to different months, all circled in red. The circled days are not dates; they’re words: **APOLOGIZE**, **REMEMBER**, **SEND**, **BEGIN**.

You grab **BEGIN** and run back to your desk, but the corridor stretches longer behind you with every step. The office door gets smaller, like a thumbnail in the distance. The phone rings again, louder, insistently, and now it’s ringing from your desk chair.

When you finally stumble out, you are in a meeting room you don’t remember entering. A dozen coworkers sit around the table, but they have your face—some younger, some older, some exhausted, some bright-eyed, all wearing slightly different versions of your clothes. Their name tags all say **YOU**, but in different fonts.

At the head of the table is your boss, now wearing a lanyard that reads **TIME**.

They slide a single sheet toward you. “You’ll present in five minutes.”

You look down.

The sheet is a mirror. Not glass—paper that reflects you in a dull, pulpy way. In it, your expression is delayed, like a poor video call. You try to smile and the reflection is still frowning.

One of the yous clears their throat. “We can’t do it,” they say.

Another you taps the table with a pen. “We’ve done it before,” they argue. “We just forgot.”

A third you—older, with tired eyes—leans in. “The trick is to stop trying to finish,” they whisper. “Start trying to make it real.”

Your boss watches without expression. The room is too quiet. Even the ventilation seems to hold its breath.

You pick up the mirror-paper and feel it flex. On the underside, in small print, there are instructions:

1. **Name what you’re afraid of.**  
2. **Choose one piece.**  
3. **Place it somewhere time can find it.**

Your heart thuds in your ribs like someone knocking on a locked door.

You stand. The conference room stretches taller, the ceiling rising into a dim sky. The projector screen unfurls on its own, a pale sail. You walk to the front with the mirror-paper in your hands and, before you can stop yourself, you say, “I’m afraid I won’t be enough. I’m afraid I’ll start and everyone will see I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m afraid I’ll finish and it still won’t matter.”

As you speak, the words appear on the screen in neat black letters. They don’t look like yours. They look like they’ve been waiting to be typed.

Your boss nods once, like a judge marking a point. “Good,” they say. “Now choose one piece.”

You look back at the table of yous. They are watching, silent, as if you’re about to pick someone to save.

You choose the smallest thing you can think of. Not the whole impossible bridge. Just a plank.

“I’ll write the first paragraph,” you say. “I’ll send the first message. I’ll make the first outline. One piece.”

The room exhales. The younger you smiles. The older you closes their eyes like someone setting down a heavy bag.

Your boss gestures toward the screen. “Place it.”

You touch the projected words, and your finger sinks into them like water. You push, and the sentence detaches from the light, becoming solid—thin, wooden, warm. A literal plank, stamped with your handwriting.

You carry it back to your desk. The office is shifting again: cubicles rearranging, walls sliding, windows opening onto different seasons. The clock above the printer spins wildly, then slows, then stops at a time that doesn’t exist—something like 3:67.

You set the plank on the floor between your chair and the hallway. It doesn’t look like much. It’s just one piece of something.

But when you step on it, it holds.

The carpet-pond still ripples, but steadier now. You place another plank—another sentence, another small action—and the space between **now** and **then** doesn’t close all at once, but it becomes crossable.

Behind you, your boss speaks softly, almost kindly. “That’s all it ever was,” they say. “A series of starts you kept calling a finish.”

You sit down and your blank keyboard suddenly has letters again, crisp and familiar. Your hands hover above it. The monitor no longer says **DUE: YESTERDAY.** It says:

**DUE: WHEN YOU BEGIN.**

The phone rings—once, twice—and you finally recognize it as your alarm. The sound bleeds into the office hum, into the fluorescent buzz, into the ringing in your ears.

You blink.

Your bedroom ceiling is above you, plain and still. Morning light leaks in around the curtains. Your heart is racing the way it does after you’ve been running.

For a moment, you can still feel the wooden plank under your feet—warm, steady, real.

And before the feeling fades, you reach for your actual phone and type one small sentence, sending it into the day like a first board laid across a gap:

**Starting now.**
