the air tightens, thick with the scent of rain and electricity. Leaves turn their pale undersides to the sky, and the trees begin to murmur—first a whisper, then a rushing hush, as if the whole forest is inhaling at once.

A single, cold drop lands on your cheek. Then another, steady as a heartbeat. The path darkens as the canopy dances, and you notice the light around you shift from gold to a strange, immersive blue. The wind curls around your ankles, tugging gently, inviting you forward.

Ahead, the trees open to a small clearing with a pond as still as glass. The storm gathers above it like a cathedral, towering clouds bruised with violet and silver. Lightning sketches thin, delicate lines across the sky, but there’s no thunder—only the soft ticking of rain on the pond, each drop blooming into a perfect ring that ripples without ever reaching the edges.

You realize your footsteps make no sound. Your breath fogs the air, and when you exhale, the fog drifts upward like smoke, weaving into the clouds. The storm doesn't feel threatening anymore. It feels purposeful, like a story remembering itself.

You step to the water’s edge and see your reflection, but it isn’t you. It’s you at five years old, grinning with a gap-toothed bravado. Then it’s you older, hair streaked with silver, eyes bright with something you haven’t learned yet. Then it’s you today, rain-slick and listening.

A distant rumble at last, not from the sky but from the earth beneath your feet—a deep, patient thunder like a drum being struck from inside the world. You kneel, press your palm to the ground, and feel it vibrating with a steady rhythm that matches your pulse. The trees sway to it. The pond’s circles begin to overlap, forming patterns that look like maps you almost recognize.

You look up as a gust sweeps the clearing, and the rain lifts—literally rises—pausing midair as if someone pressed pause on gravity. Each raindrop becomes a tiny lens, and through them you see fragments: a doorway carved into oak, a lighthouse with windows of blinking eyes, a small bird carrying a key in its beak, the curve of a shoreline you’ve never touched but somehow remember.

When the rain falls again, it’s warm. Your clothes dry in an instant as if the storm has changed its mind and chosen to nurture rather than unsettle. The thunder becomes a voice, not speaking words but meaning, and the meaning is: keep going.

You step into the pond. It’s shallow, warmer than the air, and the surface holds you a second longer than seems possible. Then you sink ankle-deep, then shin-deep, each step quiet, until the water lightens around you, glowing with that soft blue again. Fish drift by like living commas, pausing, turning, continuing.

At the center, there is a stone. Flat, wide, ancient. On its surface, etched into lichen and time, is a compass with no letters—only arrows pointing inward. You place your hand on the stone, and the storm above aligns, the clouds spiraling toward a single bright opening that reveals a sky beyond the sky.

The wind stills. The forest holds its breath. Somewhere, a bell rings, distant but clear, and you realize it’s the sound of the first raindrop, the one that touched your cheek, now echoing backward and forward through the dream.

You smile without meaning to. You close your eyes. The storm moves through you, not around you—filling your lungs with cold, bright air—and when you open your eyes again, the clearing has become a hallway of trees, their trunks bending gracefully to form arches. At the far end stands the bird with the key, head cocked, waiting.

You understand: the weather was never changing by accident. It was guiding you. You walk toward the bird, and as you do, the rain threads itself into a silver ribbon, looping from branch to branch, tracing the way ahead.

You reach out your hand. The key is light, warmer than metal, and when it touches your palm you feel the door before you see it. Behind you, thunder rolls like a satisfied sigh. Ahead, the shape of a door shimmers into the bark of the oldest tree, its grain curling into a handle.

You fit the key. You turn it. The lock clicks, like the final patter of rain on the roof as a storm clears, and the door swings inward to a room full of morning.
