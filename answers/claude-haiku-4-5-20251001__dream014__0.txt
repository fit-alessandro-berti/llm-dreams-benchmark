# The Dream Continues

...take their hands without hesitation. As we walk together through the crowded streets, the city transforms around us. The towering buildings soften into watercolor blur. The strangers' faces become familiar—people I've missed, people I've loved, all smiling.

We arrive at a place I somehow know is important, though I can't quite remember what it is. It's warm here. There's music playing, though I can't identify the song. One of them turns to me and says something I almost understand—something about not being lost at all, that I was exactly where I needed to be.

The crowd around us dissolves. The city lights become stars. I realize the strangers and I are now sitting in a circle, and between us flickers a small, steady flame. Everyone is silent, but it doesn't feel lonely anymore. It feels like coming home.

Then I notice I'm not separate from them anymore—we're all made of the same soft light, and the distinction between us blurs at the edges.

And somehow, that feels right.
