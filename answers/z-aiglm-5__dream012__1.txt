rise to the occasion, your voice cutting through the howling wind.

"Secure the mainsail!" you bellow, the words torn from your throat but reaching the ears of those who need to hear. "Reynolds, hard to starboard—we ride the swells, not fight them."

The ship groans beneath your boots, a living thing made of wood and rope and faith. Lightning fractures the sky, and for one blinding instant you see the true face of the tempest—walls of black water rising on all sides, the horizon vanished into chaos. Your first mate, a weathered woman named Cora whose face has seen fifty years of salt and sorrow, catches your eye. She doesn't speak. She doesn't need to. Her gaze says what her voice cannot: *We trust you. Do not let us drown.*

You grip the helm until your knuckles bleach white. The wheel fights you, spinning and bucking, but you hold. You always hold.

"Brace!" you command, seeing the rogue wave before anyone else—a dark tower of water climbing the night, preparing to crush you all.

The crew moves as one. Rope burns and prayers and the desperate scramble of human limbs. The wave strikes.

The world becomes cold and dark and drowning.

But when the water clears, you are still standing. The ship still floats. And somewhere beyond the storm, you see the first pale suggestion of dawn.
