You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to blend in—or risk being burned as a witch. The air hums with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, and the cobblestone streets of this medieval village twist like veins under a bruised sky. Lanterns flicker from iron hooks on timber-framed houses, casting shadows that dance like mischievous sprites. Your jeans and sneakers—relics from your "future"—stick out like a sore thumb among the woolen tunics and leather boots of the villagers milling about, haggling over loaves of rye bread and bundles of wool.

Your stomach growls, a traitor in this timeless farce, and you spot a tavern sign swinging lazily: *The Wandering Goose*. Inside, the air is thick with ale fumes and the strum of a lute from a bard with a beard like a bramble bush. You duck in, heart pounding, and claim a stool at the scarred oak bar. The barkeep, a stout woman with arms like knotted ropes, eyes you suspiciously. "Stranger from afar, eh? What'll it be? Mead? Pottage?"

You fumble for words, your modern tongue feeling clumsy. "Uh, something to eat? And... information?" She slides a wooden bowl your way—gruel studded with roots and mystery meat—and leans in, her voice a gravelly whisper. "Information costs more than a copper, lass. But I'll bite: the lord's castle up the hill seeks a scribe. One who can read the stars and scribble secrets. Pay's in silver, and the work's... enchanted."

Enchanted? Your pulse quickens. As you spoon the pottage (surprisingly not half bad), a cloaked figure slips onto the stool beside you—a boy, no older than twelve, with eyes sharp as flint. "You're not from here," he murmurs, glancing at your watch (still ticking futilely on your wrist). "I can see it in the way you walk, like the ground's made of glass. Want to get back? Follow me at dusk. There's a grove where the veil thins. But you'll need a token—a feather from the raven that guards the old oak."

The sun dips low, painting the hills in blood-orange, and you trail the boy through brambles that snag at your soul. The grove is a cathedral of ancient trees, their branches woven like lovers' fingers. The raven perches there, obsidian eyes gleaming with secrets older than time. It caws once, drops a single ebony feather into your palm, and the world tilts.

You clutch it tight, whispering your plea to whatever dream-weaver spun this yarn: *Home. Now.* The ground shimmers, the air folds like parchment, and suddenly you're tumbling—through mists of forgotten eras, brushing against pharaohs' pyramids and samurai swords—until...

You jolt awake in your bed, sheets tangled like medieval ropes, the feather still clutched in your fist. But as you blink at the ceiling fan whirring lazily above, a single black plume drifts down from nowhere, landing soft on your chest. And outside your window, a raven watches, waiting for the next dream to call you back. Sweet slumbers, wanderer. What era shall we chase tomorrow?
