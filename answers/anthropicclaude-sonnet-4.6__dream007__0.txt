...take a step back.

Not physically. You can't, really — the floor beneath you has become something between glass and water, and every time you shift your weight, ripples move outward toward the walls of the room, which aren't quite walls anymore. They're more like the *idea* of walls. Suggestions of containment.

Your friend's face keeps doing that thing faces do in dreams — staying fundamentally *them* while being slightly wrong. Their eyes the right color but too steady. Their mouth moving a half-second after the words arrive.

You decide to **say the true thing**.

In waking life you never do. You circle it, you qualify it, you protect yourself with careful language. But here, with the floor rippling and the walls suggesting themselves and the argument hanging in the air between you like weather—

You open your mouth and what comes out is **light**, faintly amber, and it takes the shape of words you didn't know you had been carrying.

*"I'm not actually angry about this. I'm frightened that you see me differently than I see myself, and I don't know which of us is right."*

The room exhales.

Your friend's face settles into something real and recognizable. They look at their hands. The floor stills.

They say: *"Me too. That's exactly it. Me too."*

And the argument — that whole sharp, important, heated architecture of the argument — doesn't disappear. It's still there. But it becomes a **door** you're both standing in front of, instead of a wall between you.

You reach for the handle.

You don't turn it yet.

That's where the dream holds you — in that perfect, suspended, terrifying moment of **before** — warm light coming through the seams, your friend beside you, the possibility not yet collapsed into outcome.

You could stay here a while.

You decide to.
