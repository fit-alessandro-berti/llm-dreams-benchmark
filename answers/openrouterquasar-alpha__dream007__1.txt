...take a deep breath and suggest moving to a quieter place to talk things through. As you walk together, the scenery around you begins to shift — the walls dissolve into a vast open field bathed in golden sunlight, gentle breezes rustling through tall grasses.

In this calm, expansive space, your friend's expression softens. Your anger fades amid the peaceful surroundings. You both sit down in the grass, and your friend says quietly, "I just want us to understand each other."

As the sun begins to set in vibrant hues across the sky, you and your friend stand and embrace, a sense of connection washing over you — and just as the dream begins to blur, you glimpse a shared smile, knowing the bond will endure beyond this moment.
