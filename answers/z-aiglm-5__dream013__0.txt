...notice the walls beginning to lose their solidity. The cold stone softens into velvet, and the sharp angles of the corridors curve into impossible, spiraling loops. The puzzles, which first demanded rigid logic and calculation, begin to shift in nature; they no longer ask for a key or a code, but for a memory or a feeling.

You realize that solving a riddle now changes the architecture itself—a bridge forms from a held breath, and a locked door dissolves into mist when you recall a forgotten song. The intense concentration you carried at the entrance gives way to a fluid, lucid intuition. You understand, with the peculiar certainty that only dreams allow, that the maze is not a prison to escape, but a reflection of your own mind, and to reach the center is simply to wake up.
