...as you move deeper into the maze, the architecture begins to disobey the laws of physics. The corridors stretch and twist like taffy, and the puzzles begin to dissolve into pure abstraction. 

You find yourself before a door made of flowing water, guarded by a sphinx who speaks not in riddles, but in the sound of your own name whispered backward. You reach for a lever to solve a logic gate, but your hand passes through it like mist. Suddenly, you realize with a jolt of dream-logic that you cannot solve this maze by thinking—you can only solve it by accepting that you are already lost. The walls melt away, revealing not an exit, but a vast, starry ocean where the floor used to be, and you step out into the void, realizing the only way out was to stop trying to leave.
