You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to run, your shoes slapping against cobblestones that seem to ripple like water beneath your feet. The buildings tower impossibly high, their windows glowing with faint, pulsating light, as if the city itself is breathing. A neon sign overhead flickers in a language you once knew but can’t recall—*“Dirección: Corazón del Espejo”*—and you clutch your chest, feeling a strange ache there.  

A street vendor appears, selling hourglasses filled with smoke. “Time’s a fickle friend here,” they say, tossing you a glass orb that shatters mid-air, scattering shards that cut your skin but leave no mark. You glance down—your reflection in a puddle isn’t yours. It’s a stranger, grinning and waving. You look up, and the street has split into two paths: one lined with doors that creak open to reveal empty rooms, the other a spiral of stairs descending into a fog so thick it hums.  

You choose the stairs. Each step whispers your name, but with a twist—*“You’re late, you’re lost, you’re always running.”* Halfway down, a clocktower materializes, its hands spinning wildly. A figure in a tailcoat leans against it, offering a pocket watch. “Your meeting’s already started,” they say, their voice echoing like a thousand echoes. “But you’re not ready yet.”  

You wake up in your bed, the alarm clock blaring *7:00 AM*. The city is gone, but your palms are still stained with the faint, smoky residue of a dream that feels… unfinished.
