You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **stop talking. The words are tangling, twisting into knots, and a deep, intuitive urge tells you to communicate differently.**

As you silence yourself, looking at your friend, their features begin to ripple. Their face isn't dissolving; it's stretching, flowing, like slow-motion liquid. Their eyes become twin lakes reflecting a sky the color of bruised plums. Their mouth expands into a vast, silent ravine, from which a soft, mournful wind begins to blow.

You realize you are no longer in a room. You are *on* your friend. Their chest is now a vast, undulating plain beneath your feet. The words of your argument are no longer sounds, but physical manifestations: thorny bushes of accusation, jagged rocks of misunderstanding, rivers of icy tears. Your friend's 'voice' is the wind, carrying whispers of their own hurt and frustration. You see your own arguments too: a looming storm cloud of stubbornness on the horizon, a thorny fence of defensiveness around a small, vulnerable part of the landscape.

The very air is thick with unspoken emotions, swirling like mist. You take a step forward, sinking slightly into the soft earth that is your friend's skin. You don't try to climb the rocky misinterpretations or ford the icy rivers. Instead, you start to simply walk, searching for a path. You pass a grove of silent trees, heavy with the weight of unsaid things. You come across a clearing where the light is soft, and for a moment, the landscape softens, the wind becomes a gentle breeze, and you see a faint, shimmering path made of threads of empathy.

You follow it, not knowing where it leads, but feeling a profound, quiet understanding blooming in the vastness of your friend's transformed being. The argument is no longer a fight, but a shared journey through an impossible, emotional world. A strange, dreamlike peace settles over you as you continue to walk, endlessly, the landscape shifting and breathing with each step, until the edges of the dream begin to blur into the soft, familiar hum of waking.
