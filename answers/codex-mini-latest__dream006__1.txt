…speak, but instead of words, a soft chorus of glowing lanterns drifts upward from the tips of my tongue. They ascend in a spiral, pulsing with warm light, and the audience leans forward, enchanted. I realize these lanterns carry pieces of my intention—comfort, curiosity, courage—each one whispering its message in colors beyond language.

As the lanterns rise, the stage beneath me dissolves into a mosaic of shifting tiles—emerald, sapphire, amber—that rearrange themselves into pathways leading toward different horizons. I take a step, and the crowd follows me, no longer seated but drifting in unison, as if their chairs have become clouds. With every word I intend to say, a new tile clicks into place, forming patterns that map the collective dream of everyone watching. Faces blur into stardust, then sharpen again, each person’s eyes reflecting a constellation of possibilities.

I raise my arms, and the empty space above the audience becomes a vast canvas. With a breath, the lanterns paint sentences in the air—sentences made of fragrance and melody. A line of jasmine-scented hope arches over a chord of clarinet laughter, weaving through the throng. They reach out, inhaling the hope, laughing at the clarinet’s tune, until a gentle hush falls. In that hush, I finally speak a single, clear word—“Imagine”—and it blossoms like a seed at everyone’s feet. From that seed, a forest of new dreams erupts, carrying both speaker and listeners beyond the boundaries of the stage—and of the dream itself—into the uncharted expanse of tomorrow.
