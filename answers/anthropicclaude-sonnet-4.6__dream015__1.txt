# The Cartographer of Broken Places

You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **draw maps**.

Not survival maps. Not tactical maps showing where the raiders camp or where the radiation pools like old mercury in the low places. No — you decide to draw *beautiful* maps.

You carry a leather satchel salvaged from what might have been a university. Inside: charcoal sticks, a jar of ink made from boiled oak galls, brushes fashioned from your own hair and wire. The paper is whatever the world offers — old receipts, the blank backs of bureaucratic forms from the Before, the pale insides of birch bark.

People think you're mad at first.

A woman named Sable, who guards a water collection station beneath a collapsed overpass, watches you sitting cross-legged in the ash, drawing the silhouette of what she calls *the Dead Cathedral* — a tangle of collapsed radio towers that caught some kind of vine, a vine nobody planted, that blooms **orange** every forty-three days like clockwork.

"You're using your last good charcoal on *that?*" she says.

"Someone should," you say.

She spits. Walks away. But she comes back an hour later and stands behind you quietly for a long time, watching the tower take shape on the birch bark. She doesn't say anything. But you hear her breath slow down.

You walk for months between settlements.

You map:

- The library that half-burned and now grows mushrooms from every shelf, the mushrooms luminescent at night, so that from a distance it looks like a lantern, like an *invitation*
- The bridge where a community has hung thousands of wind chimes made from silverware and old keys, because they believe the sound keeps bad things away, but really, you think, they do it because beauty is a form of prayer when you have no other church
- The family of seven who planted sunflowers in a circle around their shelter so precise it looks like a compass rose from the hill above — whether they planned it that way or not, your map shows it that way, because some accidents deserve to be called intention
- The place where two rivers that weren't rivers before — just broken water mains leaking for years — finally met and made something real, something with fish in it, **actual fish**, small and silver and impossible

Your maps don't show distances accurately. They show *significance* accurately. The things closer to the heart appear larger. Safe water is always drawn in blue, yes, but **so is the sky**, rendered faithfully above every location, because you decided the sky is always worth noting, even — *especially* — when it's the same ruined sky everywhere.

In a settlement called Meridian, a child named Poco finds you sleeping against a wall and rifles through your satchel before you wake.

You expect him to run.

Instead you open your eyes and find him sitting three feet away, a map unrolled across his knees, his finger tracing the vine-covered radio towers, his face doing something complicated.

"Is this real?" he asks.

"Yes."

"I've never been anywhere," he says.

You sit up slowly. Take the map from him gently. Then you take a fresh piece of bark and your second-to-last good charcoal, and you say: *Tell me about here. Tell me what matters here.* 

And Poco, who has never been anywhere, who was born after everything ended, tells you about the cat that lives under the eastern wall and has kittens every spring without fail, about the old man who knows four songs and sings them in rotation, about the gap in the southern fence where the wind comes through in a way that, if you stand in it at the right moment, sounds like someone saying a word in a language nobody speaks anymore.

You draw all of it.

His hands shake a little when you give it to him.

By the time you reach the coast — and there is a coast, the world kept its coastlines, battered but present — you have filled forty-seven maps.

You don't know how they spread. But they do.

You find one of your own maps, months old, pinned to the wall of a waystation three hundred miles from where you drew it. Someone has added to it in a different hand — careful, uncertain letters marking something you hadn't seen: *good people here.*

Someone mapped the people.

You stand in front of it for a long time.

Behind you, the survivors of everything keep moving, scavenging, arguing, grieving, planting, building, failing, trying — all the ordinary catastrophic human things.

But on the wall, in charcoal and ink and a stranger's handwriting:

**good people here.**

You take out your satchel.

You begin to draw the coast.

*You are dreaming, and in this dream the world ended and kept going, and someone decided that keeping going deserved to be witnessed, documented, illuminated — and so it was.*

*So it was.*
