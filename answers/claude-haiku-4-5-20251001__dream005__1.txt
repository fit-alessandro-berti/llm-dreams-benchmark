# The Dream Continues

...and as I move through the crowd, faces blur and sharpen unpredictably. I spot someone who might be my friend across the room, but when I reach them, they've become a stranger—though their eyes seem familiar, almost knowing.

I find myself in a conversation with a group of people discussing something urgent, though I can never quite grasp what it is. One of them keeps handing me a glass of water that I don't remember accepting. The room keeps shifting—sometimes it's a mansion, sometimes a library, sometimes both at once.

I climb a staircase looking for my friend and emerge into a garden party where everyone is wearing clothes in colors that seem too vivid. An older woman tells me my friend just left, and points in three different directions simultaneously. Her directions don't conflict—somehow I understand all three at once.

I feel a mix of relief and urgency. There's no real anxiety, just the dream-logic certainty that finding them matters deeply, though I can't remember why. In the distance, I hear laughter I recognize—or think I do.
