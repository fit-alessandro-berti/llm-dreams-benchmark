As I sit upon this dusty earth, surrounded by debris from my previous endeavors, I gaze up at the endless expanse of sky below me. My eyes close, reflecting any fatigue or lack thereof in mine. In this desolate environment, life seems simple yet unfulfilling. The remnants of civilization – metal chrome and durable items bearing a haunting resemblance to vintage vehicles that once busted up like polished stone - catch my attention. A faint scent wafts from them through the air, evoking memories of yesterday's past endeavors without the haste it normally inspires. But amidst the desolation, I am drawn forward upon this barren planet. 

The world around me takes on a surreal quality. The horizon seems to stretch as far as my senses can see, yet there is no clear dividing line between reality and the shadows that lie ahead. Smoke lingers in billowing clouds that distort views from everywhere at once. I feel like a ghost lost forever amidst an endless expanse of emptiness, unsure if I will ever find peace within this unforgiving landscape again. The world feels almost fragile; not unlike being transported through a dream yet frozen on the surface.
