**Dream Continuation:**  
As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are not typed but etched in glowing, liquid ink that swirls like smoke. The first page reads: *"Define the price of your ambition."* Your hands tremble as you turn to the next question—*"Map the crossroads where doubt nearly derailed you"*—and the next, *"Solve for x, where x is the years you’ll spend rebuilding after failure."* Panic claws at your throat; none of this was in the syllabus. The clock’s ticking morphs into a heartbeat, deafening and erratic.  

Suddenly, the words dissolve, pooling into a mirrored surface on the page. Your reflection stares back, not as you are now, but as a younger version of yourself, brimming with unbruised hope. A voice, both foreign and familiar, sighs: *"You’ve always known the answers."* The mirror shatters, and in its shards, you see flashes—late nights studying, mentors’ encouragement, quiet moments of grit. The questions rewrite themselves: *"Describe your strength in three acts." "Name the fear that fuels you."* You pick up the pen. This time, it feels like a key.  

When you wake, the terror lingers, but so does the certainty: the future isn’t a test to pass. It’s a story you’re already writing.
