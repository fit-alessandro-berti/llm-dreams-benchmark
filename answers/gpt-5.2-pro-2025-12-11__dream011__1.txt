…written in a handwriting you recognize too well: yours, but from a time before you learned to write neatly.

The first page is blank except for a single instruction printed in the center, as if the paper is holding its breath:

**DO NOT BEGIN UNTIL THE ROOM AGREES ON WHAT “BEGIN” MEANS.**

You look up. The exam hall is full, but everyone is sitting at the exact same angle, shoulders tilted toward the windows like sunflowers. Their pencils hover above the paper without touching it, trembling slightly, the way compass needles tremble when something magnetic is nearby.

The proctor—a tall figure in a suit that looks made of stapled-together syllabi—walks down the aisle. Instead of feet, it has the soft squeak of erasers. When it stops beside you, its face is a blurred badge photo that keeps failing to load.

“Name,” it says, and taps your desk with a finger that leaves a small ring of graphite.

You open your mouth, but your name doesn’t come out. What comes out is the sound of a page turning.

The second page has the questions.

They aren’t multiple choice. They’re multiple past.

**1) Describe the moment you decided who you were going to be.**
There are four lines to answer, and each line is already filled in—each in a different tone of voice. One is confident, one is apologetic, one is furious, and one is so small it looks like it was written by someone trying not to be seen.

You try to erase them. The eraser squeals and leaves the words untouched, but it rubs away part of the paper underneath, revealing a thin layer of something like skin. It’s warm.

**2) Circle the correct definition of success.**
A) A door you can close from the inside  
B) A room where everyone finally stops asking  
C) A number that grows when you look away  
D) The moment your mother’s voice becomes your own  
E) None of the above; define “correct”

You press your pencil down to circle E, but your hand keeps circling D. Your wrist feels politely hijacked.

The proctor glides by again, and you swear you can smell library dust and cold coffee. It pauses at the front and clears its throat. The sound is a stapler biting into paper.

“Time,” it announces, even though the clock above it has no hands—only a single eye that dilates and contracts.

Around you, pens begin to move. Not in the usual way. People are writing the way people knit: long loops, repetitive motions, threads of ink connecting page to page, desk to desk, as if the whole room is producing one continuous sentence.

You flip to the next question.

**3) Solve for X.**
Below it is a map of your childhood neighborhood, except the streets are labeled with things you forgot on purpose. The cul-de-sac is called **THE THING YOU SAID IN FIFTH GRADE**. The park is **THE APOLOGY YOU NEVER MADE**. The river is a thick black line labeled **TIME** and it runs directly through your old house.

At the edge of the map is an X—marked right on top of the building you’re in now.

You feel your stomach drop, the way it does on elevators.

You turn the page quickly, as if turning fast enough can change what’s printed.

**4) Write an essay arguing for your own existence.**
The prompt continues in smaller text:

*You may use evidence from:*
- your report cards  
- your search history  
- the last text you deleted  
- that dream you told nobody  
- the job you almost took  
- the person you almost became  

At the bottom is the rubric. It’s brutal.

**Clarity: 40%**  
**Originality: 30%**  
**Compliance: 20%**  
**Joy: 10% (optional)**

You stare at the word *optional* until it stops looking like a word and starts looking like a warning.

Your pencil tip snaps.

The sound echoes like a gunshot. Everyone looks up at the same time. Their faces are normal, except each one is slightly out of focus around the mouth, as if they’re mid-sentence but the sentence is buffering.

The proctor is suddenly beside you.

“No substitutions,” it says gently.

You raise your hand, the way you’ve been trained to ask for permission even to panic. “Excuse me,” you whisper, because your voice has become a library. “What happens if I fail?”

The proctor tilts its head. The badge-photo face blurs further, and for a moment you see a familiar expression underneath: your own, on a day you were trying not to cry in public.

“If you fail,” it says, “you will be assigned a life you can tolerate.”

“And if I pass?”

“You will be responsible for choosing one.”

The room swallows that. Even the fluorescent lights seem to hush.

You look back down at the exam. There is a question you hadn’t noticed, printed faintly along the margin, as if it was ashamed to be seen asking.

**0) Before everything else: What do you want?**
There is a wide blank space under it, generous as a field.

Your hand trembles over the emptiness. The emptiness feels like the edge of a diving board.

You try to write something safe—something acceptable, something that could be graded without anyone frowning. *Security.* *Meaning.* *A career that makes sense on paper.*

But the pencil doesn’t move until you stop trying to sound like someone who deserves to be here.

Instead, without planning to, you write:

*I want to wake up and not immediately apologize for taking up space.*

The sentence sits there. It looks too honest to be allowed.

The clock-eye above the proctor widens.

For the first time, the proctor smiles—not like a teacher, not like a judge. Like someone who has been waiting outside a door and just heard the lock click.

“You may begin,” it says.

And the room exhales.

All at once, the other exams rustle like a flock of birds. The walls soften, their edges losing their geometry, the fluorescent lights melting into something like morning. The desks seem less like cages and more like furniture someone chose.

You look back at question one. The pre-written answers are still there, but now they feel like drafts instead of verdicts. Your eraser still can’t remove them, but your pencil can write between the lines.

You start, slowly. Not racing the clock. Not writing what will earn points.

Just writing.

Halfway through the essay, you realize the exam is no longer asking you to prove you deserve a future. It’s asking you to invent one in ink.

When you finally look up, the proctor is gone. The students are gone. The room is gone.

You are sitting at a small table by a window. Outside, the world is pale and undecided, like paper before the first mark. In front of you is a single sheet with one last line at the bottom:

**SIGN HERE TO ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR ANSWERS.**

You pick up the pencil.

Your signature comes out steady.

As you dot the last letter, the paper warms under your hand, and the sound you hear—soft, unmistakable—is not a stapler.

It’s a door unlocking.

You wake with the taste of graphite in your mouth, your hand curled as if still holding the pencil, and for a few seconds you can’t remember what you were afraid of—only that somewhere, in a room that might still exist, you finally started.
