### **You Are at a Large Social Gathering Where You Only Know One Person...**

As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and…

---

**…you notice that each group is engaged in something bizarre or surreal, as if the entire event has stepped out of reality.**

The first group you pass is sitting around a small bonfire inside a glass booth. They’re all wearing matching silver masks and sipping from teacups, laughing quietly as if watching a silent film only they can see. One of them turns to you with a warm smile and gestures to an empty chair, but the moment you step closer, the fire flickers violently and they all vanish, leaving only a single black feather on the floor.

You pocket the feather and continue weaving through the crowd. The music is oddly muffled — it sounds like it’s coming from somewhere far away, even though people are dancing right in front of you. You pass a man in a suit made entirely of clocks; the hands tick wildly in different directions. He nods at you and says, “She went that way,” pointing toward a hallway lined with glowing, translucent paintings.

In thenext room, you see a circle of children playing with shadow puppets that seem to have a life of their own. The shadows flicker and stretch across the walls, forming strange symbols before dissolving into smoke. One child looks up at you and holds out a tiny, glowing key. “You’re almost there,” they say, their voice echoing like it’s coming from a tunnel.

You take the key and notice a strange chill. A woman in a long red cloak stands alone near a tall, narrow mirror that seems deeper than it should be. She doesn’t look at you, but her voice fills the room:  
*"The one you seek is not lost — she is waiting where time forgets to move."*

You follow her cue and make your way toward a grand clock tower at the far end of the venue. The hour hands are frozen at 11:33. There, in the shadows beneath the tower, you finally spot **her** — the one person you came for.

But as you approach, the dream shifts again.

The floor beneath you becomes uneven, as though you’re walking on water. The lights flicker, dimming with each step. The sounds of the party fade into a soft hum, and the air grows heavy with the scent of old books and rain.

You reach her side, and she turns — but her face is obscured by a shifting, luminous veil. She speaks without moving her lips:

> “You found me, but now you must choose. Stay in this dream, where everything is possible but nothing is real… or wake up and carry only what you’ve learned back into the waking world.”

Behind her, a door begins to open — it leads to a place you don’t recognize, but it feels like home.

**What will you do?**  
Will you step through the door, or will you stay in the gathering where mysteries unfold endlessly?
