...and each group seems to exist in its own pocket universe, disconnected from the others. 

First, you drift towards a cluster laughing uproariously around a shimmering, liquid-like bar. As you approach, their laughter sharpens, becoming metallic and grating. Their faces blur slightly, features melting like wax near a flame. One person turns to you, their mouth stretching impossibly wide into a silent, gaping hole where words should form. You feel a cold dread and quickly back away.

Next, you find yourself near a group dressed in immaculate, outdated Victorian attire, frozen mid-conversation like mannequins. They stand perfectly still on a Persian rug that seems to float inches above the polished floor. You try to ask if they've seen your friend, but your voice comes out as a faint whisper, swallowed by the sudden silence enveloping them. Only their eyes move, slowly tracking you with unnerving stillness. You shiver and move on.

A warm, golden light draws you towards a corner where people lounge on impossibly soft, cloud-like cushions. They speak in harmonious, melodic tones, their words weaving complex patterns in the air that you can almost see. You feel a pull, a sense of belonging that’s both comforting and alarming. One woman smiles, offering you a floating teacup that steams with iridescent vapor. As you reach for it, the cup dissolves into shimmering dust. The group sighs softly, a sound like wind chimes, and their forms begin to fade, becoming translucent. The panic returns – where is your friend?

You weave faster through the shifting crowds, the room itself seeming to stretch and contract. Groups now appear and vanish like smoke: a circle of people juggling glowing orbs that hum; a pair arguing silently, their frustration visible as waves of heat distortion; a lone figure staring intensely at a spot on the ceiling, tears tracing paths of light down their cheeks.

Suddenly, you spot the back of your friend's head – that distinctive haircut, that familiar jacket. Relief floods you. You push through a group that feels like walking through thick cobwebs, calling their name. Your voice is weak, swallowed again. You reach out, your fingers almost brushing their shoulder... and they turn.

It isn't your friend. It's someone with a perfectly smooth, featureless face like polished porcelain. It tilts its head, and you feel a profound, echoing emptiness emanating from it. The realization hits you with the cold weight of deep water: you don't actually know *anyone* here. Not really. The "one person" you thought you knew is just a fading memory, a name you can't quite grasp anymore.

The featureless figure extends a smooth, handless limb. Not to touch you, but pointing past you, towards a set of grand doors that weren't there before. They swing open silently, revealing not the outside world, but a serene, moonlit garden filled with glowing flowers and the sound of gentle, flowing water. A sense of profound, quiet peace washes over you, replacing the panic. You step towards the garden, the noise and strangeness of the gathering fading behind you like a forgotten dream, as you finally wake up in the soft grey light of early morning.
