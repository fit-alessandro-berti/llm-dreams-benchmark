You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city — the streets are made of glass and iron, the buildings rise like skyscrapers of light, and the air shimmers with whispers you can't quite hear. The silence is thick, almost alive, as if the city breathes around you. You walk down a narrow alley that disappears into a towering archway, its surface etched with forgotten constellations. 

You pause, looking around, unsure where your meeting could be. The silence grows heavier, and you hear a faint echo of a voice — gentle, familiar, but vaguely distant. You follow it, your footsteps echoing on the polished floor. 

Suddenly, a door appears before you, unmarked and cold. You approach it cautiously, wondering what it could hold. As you click it open, a soft light spills out, revealing a room filled with books, maps, and a single notebook that reads "Meeting." 

You glance at the clock — it wouldn't be much longer. You know you have to find it before the hour strikes. But what does it symbolize? A dream? A memory? Or something else entirely? 

What do you do next?
