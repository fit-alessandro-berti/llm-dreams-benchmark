…you do.

The wind shifts first—cool and sharp, slicing through the canopy like a blade being drawn. The air thickens, not just with rain’s promise but with something older, electric. The trees around you bend inward, not from fear but reverence. Their leaves whisper a language you almost recognize—something between whale-song and the hush of snowfall.

You see it: the sky above you writhing like ink in water, but dark blue, almost black, moving in spirals that aren’t clouds. A的低语从树影中传来。As you blink, the forest floor beneath you trembles—not with thunder, but with the rhythm of a heartbeat. Not yours. Something else's.

You want to run, but your legs won’t move. Instead, your shoes begin to sink—*not* into dirt, but into memory. The soil is soft and warm, like a grave, and every step you *don’t* take releases fragments of your past in the form of fireflies: birthdays, first loves, the taste of your mother’s soup, the last time you saw your father’s eyes before they closed.

You realize the storm isn’t coming *to* you. It’s coming *from* you.

And then you wake up—not in bed, but still walking. Still sinking. The forest is silent now. The trees have turned to mirrors. Your reflection is still there, but older, smiling, waving you forward.
