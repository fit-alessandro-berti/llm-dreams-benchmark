You tighten your grip on the wheel, fingers white with effort, and shout your orders over the roar of wind and wave. The deck pitches beneath your boots, but your eyes are steel‑bright.

You bark a command to the first mate: “Reef the mainsail! Lessen her canvas before she tears in two!” The crew scrambles, ropes chafe their hands as they haul in sheets and bolt the sail to the mast. Each man and woman moves with purpose, trusting your voice to guide them through chaos.

Lightning cracks the sky, illuminating the churned sea where monstrous swells rise like granite walls. In that flash you glimpse something impossible: the silhouette of a colossal sea‑serpent, eyes glowing emerald in the rain. It slithers alongside, riding the troughs, as if escorting you through this trial.

Heart pounding, you lean forward and speak to it: not out of fear but with the calm authority of a leader. “We seek safe passage, friend of the deep. Show us the way.” For a moment the storm’s howl seems to pause in deference. Then the creature submerges, leaving behind a trail of phosphorescent blue.

Trusting the omen, you swing the wheel hard to starboard. The ship responds, her bow slicing into the next wave instead of letting it crush your stern. Crew members snap to attention, following your lead, their faces alight with renewed hope.

Gradually the wind abates; the sea softens into gentle swells. The clouds part, revealing a pale dawn. On the horizon, a cluster of jagged rocks gives way to a tranquil cove dotted with palms and white sand. Relief washes over you: you have guided them through the storm, and now land awaits.

As you climb the rails to survey the calm shore, the world tilts once more—and you awaken, heart still racing, the taste of brine on your lips, the echo of your own command lingering in the mind’s deep waters.
