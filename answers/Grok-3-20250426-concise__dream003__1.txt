symbols etched into the surface, glowing faintly. You trace a pattern with your finger, and the box clicks open, revealing a swirling vortex of light. A voice whispers, "Choose your path." You step into the vortex, finding yourself in a vibrant, shifting dreamscape where gravity bends and colors sing. A shadowy figure approaches, holding a mirror that reflects not your face, but a memory you’d forgotten. The figure asks, “What will you trade for this truth?” You reach into your pocket, pulling out a glowing orb of your deepest fear. As you hand it over, the dreamscape dissolves, and you wake, the box now open beside you, empty but warm to the touch.
