As you navigate the bustling crowd, the dream takes on a more surreal quality. The faces of the people around you begin to blur, their features shifting and changing as if they are made of liquid. You catch glimpses of your friend—a flash of their jacket, the sound of their laugh—but they always seem to vanish just as you approach.

The groups of people you pass through now feel more like scenes from a play. One group is engaged in a heated debate about something nonsensical, like the best way to count clouds. Another group is frozen in place, mid-dance, their expressions caught between joy and despair. A third group is slowly sinking into the floor, their voices muffled as if underwater.

You start to feel a growing sense of urgency, as though finding your friend is the key to escaping this strange place. You pick up your pace, weaving through the crowd with determination. Suddenly, the room begins to stretch and twist, the walls elongating like taffy. The lights flicker, casting eerie shadows that seem to move on their own.

Just as you think you might be lost forever, you spot your friend standing at the edge of a grand staircase. They smile and beckon you to follow. Relief washes over you as you step onto the stairs, but with each step, the world around you shifts. The staircase leads not to another room, but to a vast, endless sky. You and your friend are now floating among the stars, the social gathering a distant memory.

As you float there, a sense of peace settles over you. The dream shifts again, and you find yourself waking up, the details of the gathering fading, but the feeling of connection with your friend remains.
