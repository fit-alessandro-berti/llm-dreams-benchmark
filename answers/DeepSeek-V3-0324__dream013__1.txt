realize that the walls are shifting subtly, as if the maze itself is alive. The air hums with an eerie energy, and faint whispers seem to guide—or misguide—you.  

Ahead, you see three doors, each marked with a cryptic symbol:  

1. **The Door of Infinite Reflections** – Its surface shimmers like liquid mercury, showing distorted versions of yourself.  
2. **The Door of Whispering Shadows** – Dark tendrils curl around its edges, murmuring riddles in a language you almost understand.  
3. **The Door of Fractal Equations** – Glowing symbols pulse across its surface, forming and dissolving like \( e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \).  

A voice echoes in your mind: *"Choose wisely, for the maze learns from your choices."*  

Which door do you take? Or do you try something unexpected?
