**Dream Continuation:**

You notice the questions are *not* written on the page—but instead, they’re **spoken aloud by an unseen voice**, one that shifts between a teacher’s calm authority and a whisper of something far older, more insidious. The voice doesn’t say the questions directly, but rather *hints* at them, weaving fragments into the air around you:

*"The first question is not about the rules you’ve memorized… but the one you’ve forgotten to follow. The second asks not what you’ve learned, but what you’ve *wanted* to learn—and why you lied to yourself about it. The third… oh, the third is the one you’ve been avoiding, the one that doesn’t fit into the boxes on your resume."*

Your hands tremble as you reach for a pen, but the paper is **floating just above your desk**, as if the questions are alive. The ink is black, but when you dip the tip, it glows faintly—like blood. The voice laughs, low and resonant, as if it’s amused by your panic.

Then, the questions *materialize* in your mind’s eye:

1. **"What is the first lie you told yourself to survive?"**
2. **"Which of your skills was stolen from someone else—and why did you keep it?"**
3. **"If you could erase one thing from your life without consequence, what would it be, and why does that make you feel guilty?"**
4. **"The exam is over. Now, what are you *really* being tested for?"**

The room grows colder. The air smells like old books and something metallic. The voice—now your own—whispers back to you: *"You already know the answers. But do you know the question?"*

A shadow stretches across the ceiling. It’s not light. It’s *you*, but older, with hollow eyes and hands that move on their own. It reaches down and **takes your pen**, leaving you with only your voice.

The final question is spoken aloud, and it’s not a question at all—it’s a **command**:

*"Now, write your own."*

**What happens next?**
- Do you realize this is a test of your **true self** (not your career path)?
- Does the voice reveal it’s a **prisoner’s voice**, trapped in your mind?
- Or is it something *else* testing you—something that’s been waiting for you to fail?
- **Or…** do you wake up, and the exam was never about the future at all?
