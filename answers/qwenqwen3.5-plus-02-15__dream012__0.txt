You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you **realize the lightning isn't striking from the sky, but rising from the depths of the ocean.**

The waves don't crash; they whisper. Each crest breaks into a thousand voices, reciting memories you thought you had lost. The helmsman, a man made entirely of driftwood and sea glass, turns to you with eyes that are hollow yet full of stars. "The compass is spinning backwards, Captain," he says, his voice sounding like grinding stones. "We aren't trying to reach land anymore. We are trying to reach the moment before the storm began."

You grip the wheel, but it feels warm, like living flesh. The ship tilts violently, not to the left or right, but *inward*, folding space around you. Suddenly, the rain stops mid-air, hanging like suspended diamonds. The crew freezes in place, not as statues, but as paintings on a canvas that is still wet.

You step away from the wheel and walk to the bow. The ocean below has turned into a vast mirror, reflecting not the stormy sky above, but a quiet, sunlit bedroom with an unmade bed and an alarm clock ticking softly on a nightstand. The ship dissolves into mist, and as you reach out to touch the reflection, the sound of the ocean fades into the buzzing of an alarm.

You wake up, the taste of salt still on your lips, wondering if the storm was ever real, or if you are the one who is still sailing.
