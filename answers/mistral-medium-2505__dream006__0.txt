speak—but suddenly, your voice vanishes. No matter how hard you try, only a whisper escapes your lips. The audience shifts uncomfortably, murmuring among themselves. Panic rises in your chest as you realize you’ve forgotten your entire speech. The words dissolve like mist, leaving only a blank, suffocating silence.

Then, a strange sensation pulls at your feet. You glance down and see the stage dissolving beneath you, turning into a swirling vortex of colors. The audience fades into shadowy figures, their faces melting into abstract shapes. A warm breeze brushes against your skin, and you realize—you’re floating.

The stage is gone. You’re drifting upward, weightless, as the world below transforms into a vast, star-strewn sky. A voice, soft and distant, whispers in your ear: *"You were never meant to speak. You were meant to fly."*

And then—you wake up.
