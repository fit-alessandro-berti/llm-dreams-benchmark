feel a surge of anxiety mixed with determination. The clock on the wall seems to tick louder, each second echoing your growing pressure. You glance at your computer screen, the blank document glaring back at you like a challenge. Suddenly, your fingers start to move almost on their own, typing rapidly as ideas flood your mind. The impossible feels a little less impossible now, as you find hidden reserves of creativity and focus. Your boss watches, not with impatience, but with a hint of surprise and respect. Time seems to stretch and slow, giving you a chance to turn the impossible into something achievable.
