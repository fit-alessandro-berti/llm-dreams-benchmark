You are dreaming. I'll continue this dream scenario for you:

You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and find yourself drifting between conversations like a ghost. The faces around you seem to shift subtly when you're not looking directly at them.

In one corner, a group discusses something with intense focus, their voices dropping to whispers whenever you approach. You catch fragments about "the coming change" and "those who will remember."

The architecture of the building begins to feel wrong - hallways stretch longer than they should, and doorways sometimes lead to the same room you just left. The lighting flickers occasionally, and during these moments, you glimpse strange symbols on the walls that vanish when the lights stabilize.

Your phone has no signal, and the time displayed keeps jumping between numbers that don't make sense. 3:47. Then 10:22. Then 3:47 again.

You finally spot your friend across the room, but as you approach, three different people wearing identical outfits to your friend appear in different corners of the room. They all turn to look at you simultaneously, wearing expressions of concern.

"You're not supposed to be here yet," one of them says, though their lips don't move.

A gentle chime sounds, and everyone freezes except you. A door appears on a wall where there wasn't one before, glowing softly around its edges.

Do you open it?
