As I step onto the stage, I see the crowd looking expectantly at me, and I begin to feel a strange sensation. The room, which was bustling with murmurs just a moment ago, is now completely silent. The air is thick with anticipation, and I can feel the weight of hundreds of eyes on me.

Suddenly, the lectern in front of me starts to shimmer and transform. It sprouts legs and a face, becoming a small, wooden podium-creature. It smiles at me, its eyes warm and encouraging. "You'll do great," it whispers, its voice like the rustling of leaves.

I look out at the audience again, and now they're not just people in seats. They're a sea of colors, each person glowing with a unique hue, like a vast aurora borealis. They shift and ripple, the colors mixing and blending in a mesmerizing dance. I realize that each color represents their emotions, their hopes, their fears.

A soft melody begins to play from nowhere, a gentle piano tune that seems to guide my steps as I walk closer to the edge of the stage. The podium-creature rolls along beside me, its wooden legs clicking on the stage floor.

I open my mouth to speak, but instead of words, out come vibrant, shimmering bubbles. Each one floats out into the audience, popping gently above their heads. As each bubble pops, it releases a tiny, glowing symbol, which floats down and settles on the person below. The symbols seem to bring comfort and joy, as the colors of the audience shift to warmer, brighter hues.

The podium-creature nods at me, its job done, and it transforms back into a simple lectern. The music fades, and the audience's colors begin to coalesce into a beautiful, harmonious rainbow. I wake up, the sounds of their applause still ringing in my ears.
