You start to run through the labyrinth of narrow, twisting streets, your breath coming in short, panicked gasps. The city is alive with a strange, dreamlike energy—buildings pulse with soft light, and the air hums with whispers that sound like voices from another time. You pass by shops that flicker in and out of existence, and people with faces blurred like smoke walk past you, never noticing your desperation.

You try to ask for directions, but no one answers. Your voice seems to vanish into the air. You check your watch—only 45 minutes left. Panic rises in your chest, but then you notice something strange: a clock tower in the distance, its hands spinning backward. It’s not just any clock—it’s the same one from your childhood, the one that always made you feel both comforted and confused.

As you approach it, the streets shift and rearrange themselves, leading you toward a grand, ancient-looking building with an arched entrance. A sign above the door reads: *The Place of Remembered Things*. You hesitate, then push the door open.

Inside, the air is cool and quiet. Shelves line the walls, filled with objects that seem to belong to other lives—old letters, broken toys, forgotten dreams. At the center of the room stands a mirror, not of glass, but of liquid silver. As you step closer, your reflection smiles at you and says, “You’re looking for the meeting, aren’t you?”

“You know where it is?” you ask, heart racing.

“I know where it *was*,” the reflection replies. “But you must decide—will you go back to the moment you first forgot, or will you move forward into what you’ve yet to remember?”

The mirror ripples, and suddenly you’re standing in a different place—a small room with a single chair, a table, and a clock that reads 11:59. The meeting is about to begin.

Do you sit down? Or do you turn back and try to find the path again?
