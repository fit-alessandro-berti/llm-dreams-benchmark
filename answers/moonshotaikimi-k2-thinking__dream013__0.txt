...realize the walls are made of your own thoughts, each brick a memory you've forgotten. The puzzles begin to shift—no longer logical, but emotional. One door opens only when you recall a shame you've buried; another corridor tightens with each doubt you feel.

Your hands start turning translucent, and you notice the maze has no ceiling—just infinite layers of mirrors reflecting versions of yourself solving puzzles you haven't reached yet. Some of those versions are screaming. Others are laughing.

The deeper you go, the more the maze breathes. The corridors pulse with a rhythm that matches your heartbeat, but slower. *You're catching up to it.* The final puzzle isn't written on a wall—it's written on the inside of your skull, and you can only read it by looking backwards through your own eyes.

You wake up with a key in your hand that you recognize from a dream you had when you were seven. The room is different. The door is still locked.
