...each one peels back a layer of who you thought you had to be.  

The first challenge is a job interview—except it's in a room made entirely of mirrors. Every question they ask, your reflection answers before you can. You realize the panel isn't watching you—they're watching the reflections. You learn to breathe so deeply that your reflection stutters, caught in the pause between heartbeats. You get the job.

The second challenge is a 48-hour silent retreat with your future boss. No words—just tasks: build a bridge from straws, cook dinner with tongue-twisters as recipes, tell a story using only shadows. You discover you both hate jazz but love the sound of coffee pouring at 5:47 a.m. You don't get the final job, but you get offered a mentorship instead.

In the third challenge, you're dropped into a city made of your childhood memories. Every corner is a choice: the tree where you kissed your first love, the street where your father cried, the classroom where you first felt small. You choose to sit on the fire escape with the version of yourself who quit trying at 13. You tell them: "I'm not fixing your mistakes. I'm just climbing up to thank you for surviving long enough to get here." They hand you a key labeled "For later."

In the final challenge, the VR headset freezes. The code breaks. You wake up—inside a real elevator, holding a manila envelope. The doors open to reveal your actual future coworkers, already laughing at your joke about spreadsheets. You open the envelope: inside is the offer letter... and the dream version of *you* from the competition, standing there in the corner, holding the key from the fire escape.

"You forgot this," the reflection says. "Turns out your dream job isn't the job. It's the version of you who figured out the world always starts as a puzzle made of people who didn't think you were ready yet."

You choose to step out of the elevator with both of you.
