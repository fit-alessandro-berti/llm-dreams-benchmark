Okay, let’s fill this dream. Here goes…

…You are at a large social gathering. It’s a kaleidoscope of colours – velvet reds, glittering blues, and sunflower yellows. Everyone’s laughing, talking loudly, and swirling around a long, rickety table filled with plates piled high with impossibly bright fruit. You are at the far end of the chaos, utterly disoriented, desperately seeking a familiar face. Each attempt feels like a miniature replay of yesterday – a waitress who offered a disconcertingly large slice of something pink, a man wearing a bright green hat arguing with someone else about a pigeon, a gaggle of overly energetic teenagers juggling inflatable oranges.  Trying to focus, you push through a surprisingly dense forest of floral wallpaper – they’re adorned with tiny, watchful portraits. 

You finally spot *them*. Sitting a considerable distance away, across from the overflowing table, is a man with silver hair falling across a weathered face, meticulously arranging miniature teacups. Around him, a tiny, perfectly crafted orchestra is playing – a single viol line, a hesitant flute, and a single, mournful cello. He looks up. A slow, unsettling smile spreads across his lips.  And you recognize him.

"I know," you mutter, pulling out your hand. "It’s you."

Suddenly, the music stops. A swirling vortex appears before him - a hazy, melancholic scene of rain, rusted umbrellas, and half-remembered childhood.  People from the gathering begin to materialize, drawn towards him, absorbed in the image. They don’t recognize you...they look at *you*… with a profound and aching sadness.  A woman with paint-splattered clothes begins to weep, clutching a small sketch of a bird. A man meticulously adjusts *his* tiny umbrella. Even the teenagers drop their oranges and stare. 

He turns directly to you, and you instinctively want to run, but your feet move like lead. His eyes, though – they *feel* like acceptance, but also an unimaginable grief. He extends his hand. 

“Welcome,” a low, ancient voice fills the space, barely audible. "It’s always been here. Just…waiting for someone to remember.” 

**So, where do you go from here?**

Do you:
1.  Touch his hand, risking a flood of memories? (Suggesting a deeper, more emotional connection?)
2.  Slowly withdraw and try to escape the vortex of faces?
3.  Hesitantly try to start a conversation, even though you don't know which words will ring true? 
4.  Just... stand there, observing the surreal tableau, lost and bewildered?
