...find a way to communicate with someone about where I am and how I got here. The air is thick with the smell of woodsmoke and baking bread, and I hear the clanging of pots and pans in the distance. I'm standing in the middle of a bustling village, with thatched roofs and timber-framed houses. Everyone around me is dressed in clothing from another century.

I look around for someone to talk to, but everyone seems too busy to notice me standing there, frozen and out of place. I try to approach a woman carrying a wicker basket, but she gives me a curious glance and hurries on her way.

As I try to get my bearings, I notice a figure walking towards me. It's an elderly man with a long white beard and a pointed hat. He looks like a mixture of a wizard and a baker. He squints at me and asks in a thick accent, "Who 'art you, stranger?"

I try to explain that I'm not from around here, but the words get tangled in my throat. I start to stammer and point out the strange clothes I'm wearing, trying to convey that I'm from a different time. The old man furrows his brow and says, "Ah, ye must be from the future, one of the pamphleteers from the village of Valencia!"

For some reason, I nod, hoping that he believes me. "Yes, that's right. I've come from... Valencia." I try to gauge my surroundings, but the old man simply grins and beckons me to follow him.

"Come, traveler," he says. "I'll introduce you to the village elder. We've had rumors of strangers arriving by neither wind nor wheel. It seems you're the proof we need."

As I follow the old man, I glance back at the strange obstinate construction on my left which drew my eye.
