You start to walk, weaving through unfamiliar streets that stretch on in every direction. At first, you pass rows of tall, gray-brown buildings—blocky and featureless, like they were sculpted out of clay and left to harden without detail. You can’t read the street signs. They’re written in a language you’ve never seen before, one made up of strange looping characters and angled lines that shift whenever you glance away.

People rush past you, all dressed differently—some in muted business suits, others in vibrant robes or armor made of interlinked metal rings. It’s as if a dozen worlds collided here, and no one seems to notice the mismatch. You grab at their sleeves, trying to ask directions, but your voice comes out soft and muffled, as if spoken underwater. Most ignore you, but one figure—an older woman whose face is half-hidden behind a delicate embroidered veil—pauses just long enough to point upward. Then she continues on, leaving you with only that gesture and a silent smile.

You look up. Above you, the city continues in layers. There are stacked walkways of glass and copper that form a web overhead. You can see people moving along these aerial bridges, carrying briefcases and long rolled scrolls. You realize that whatever meeting you need to attend must be somewhere higher. A vague sense of memory tugs at you: a name, a place, something about a room with a floor of mosaic tiles. You can almost picture it—a hallway with red and green patterns on the ground, leading to a door marked with a symbol like a spiraling galaxy.

With a deep breath, you search for a stairway or an elevator, anything that can lead you to those upper levels. Instead, the sidewalk beneath your feet sinks downward, becoming a gently sloping path. You follow it into a small courtyard tucked between towering buildings. In the center, you find a tree unlike any you’ve ever seen: its bark the color of molten gold, its leaves shaped like keys. Each leaf rattles in an unseen wind. There’s a low hum in the air. Somehow you know that if you pluck one of these leaves, it will grant you passage or knowledge. Hesitantly, you reach out and take one.

At once, you feel a surge of clarity. The city seems to settle into a pattern. Your eyes find a tall tower in the distance—impossibly thin and crowned with rotating gears. You realize that must be your destination. Of course. You remember now: You need to meet with someone who can help you decode a map, or a contract, or something that will change the course of your life. There’s not much time.

Armed with this new sense of direction, you navigate toward the tower. The streets no longer seem random. Vendors are selling wares in languages you cannot speak, but you understand their gestures, and when you ask if the tower is near, they point you down a corridor of green-tinted glass. You hurry along it, time pressing in on you, the sense of urgency tightening in your chest.

As you approach the base of the tower, a spiral door of beaten metal curls open for you, revealing an old-fashioned elevator cage inside. You step in, and it begins to ascend. Through the lattice of metal bars, you watch the city fall away beneath you. The people become tiny figures darting in and out of shadow, and the stacked walkways look like shining ribbons wound around stone pillars.

When the elevator stops, you step out into a hallway exactly as you’d pictured: the mosaic floor shimmering in patterns of ruby and emerald glass, the door at the end carved with that spiral symbol. Your heart thuds in your chest. You’ve made it, and you realize that the meeting is not just important—it feels like the culmination of something long-awaited, perhaps even fated.

You walk toward the door, and as you reach for the handle, you notice that the key-shaped leaf you picked earlier has disappeared. In its place, you find a small, intricate token in your hand—a piece of the city’s strange script etched in soft metal. You have no idea what it means, yet you feel certain it’s the missing puzzle piece you’ve been carrying all along.

The door opens without resistance, and as you step into the dimly lit room, you see a figure waiting for you at a round table. They beckon you closer, their voice serene and warm. Outside, the gears atop the tower keep turning, and somewhere far below, the golden tree shivers its leafy keys in a breeze that you cannot feel. You are here, at last, exactly where you need to be.
