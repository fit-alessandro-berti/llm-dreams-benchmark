You are dreaming. You find yourself holding a mysterious locked box, its surface cool and unyielding, with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns etched across itâ€”symbols that seem to shift and dance under your gaze, as if alive with secrets. The box feels ancient, heavy with untold stories, and a faint hum begins to fill the air, vibrating through your fingertips. You sense an urgent pull deep within you, a need to unravel the puzzle it presents, but time feels fragile, slipping away like sand through your hands. What will you do next as the hum grows louder and the patterns glow faintly in the dim light of your dream?
