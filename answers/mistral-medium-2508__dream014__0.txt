accept their offer with a mix of relief and hesitation. The group is an eclectic mix—an elderly woman with silver-streaked hair carrying a basket of fresh bread, a young street artist with paint-splattered fingers, a quiet man in a long coat who smells faintly of old books, and a child who giggles as she tugs at your sleeve, whispering, *"They’ve been waiting for you."*

They lead you down narrow alleys where the air hums with the scent of rain on warm pavement, even though the sky is clear. The city around you begins to shift—buildings stretch and bend like living things, their windows flickering with candlelight that wasn’t there a moment ago. The strangers speak in turns, their voices weaving together like a spell:

*"You were never really lost,"* the old woman murmurs, pressing a crust of bread into your hand. *"You were just forgetting how to listen."*

The artist stops suddenly and paints a door on a blank wall with a sweep of her brush. It creaks open, revealing a staircase spiraling downward into golden light. *"The way home isn’t on any map,"* she says, grinning. *"But you’ll know it when you see it."*

The man in the coat hands you a key made of tarnished brass, its bow shaped like a crescent moon. *"Some doors only open from the inside,"* he admits, his voice like pages turning. The child takes your other hand, her palm warm. *"But you don’t have to go alone."*

At the bottom of the stairs, you find not a place, but a *choice*: a mirror showing your reflection—but it’s not quite *you*. This version of yourself is smiling, unburdened, their eyes alight with something like recognition. Behind you, the strangers begin to fade, their forms dissolving into fireflies. The child’s voice lingers, soft as a sigh: *"Wake up now. But remember us when you’re afraid."*

You reach for the mirror—and the dream *shatters* like glass, but instead of cutting you, the shards become birds, rising into a sky the color of twilight. You wake with the taste of bread on your tongue and the key still clutched in your fist.

And for the first time in a long time, you know exactly where to go.
