all written in a language you've never seen before. The letters curve and swirl in unfamiliar patterns, and the words seem to dance on the page. You feel a wave of panic wash over you. How can you possibly complete this exam if you can't understand the questions?

Suddenly, you remember a small, leather-bound book you found in your grandparent's attic. It was filled with ancient symbols and languages, some of which looked similar to the one on the exam paper. You had always been fascinated by it, but never thought you'd have a use for it.

With no other options, you close your eyes and concentrate. You visualize the pages of the book, the strange symbols and letters. You feel a strange sensation, as if your mind is expanding, reaching out to grasp the forgotten knowledge. When you open your eyes, the questions on the exam paper begin to make sense.

The rest of the exam goes smoothly. You answer each question with confidence, the strange language feeling as familiar as your own. When the time is up, you put down your pen and breathe a sigh of relief. You did it.

As you leave the exam hall, you wake up. The dream lingers in your mind, a strange mix of fear and exhilaration. You can't help but wonder if there's a grain of truth in it. Maybe you do have a knack for languages, hidden deep within your subconscious. The thought brings a smile to your face. Whatever the future holds, at least you've got a fascinating dream to remember.
