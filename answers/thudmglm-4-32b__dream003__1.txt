Okay, I'm in the dream... here I go...

...a network of symbols etched *into* the wood itself, not just painted on. They shimmer faintly in the half-light of this strange, floating room I'm in. Trying to force it is pointless; the lock groans slightly, a deep, resonant sound that vibrates through my fingertips like a warning.

Then, a whisper, not of sound, but of thought, directly into my mind: "They are whispers of Akello, the Record Keeper. Listen."

Suddenly, the box seems to grow in my hands, and the patterns pulse, almost like a heartbeat. Images flicker behind my eyelids – ancient libraries, towering mountains shaped like keys, rivers of flowing numbers. The symbols on the box shift, mirroring these images, rearranging themselves slightly. One particular symbol, a stylized eye surrounded by runes, seems to throb.

A small, glowing, ethereal key takes shape in the air before me. It isn't made of metal, but of solidified moonlight, the same runes spiraling up its length as the ones on the box. It hovers, waiting. I instinctively reach for it.
