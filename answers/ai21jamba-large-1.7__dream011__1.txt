…completely blank. You pick up your pen, your heart pounding, and flip through the pages, but there’s nothing written on any of them—just crisp, white paper staring back at you. Panic rises as you glance around the room and see other students calmly writing, as if they can see something you can’t.

You turn to the instructor, who is sitting at the front of the room, reading a newspaper. You raise your hand and try to get their attention, but they don’t even look up. Time is ticking, and you feel a growing sense of dread. You wonder if everyone else can see the questions, or if this is some sort of cruel test of your ability to stay calm under pressure.

Out of the corner of your eye, you spot a piece of paper on the desk next to you. It's a small note, crumpled, and hastily scribbled. You lean over and quickly read the words: “You already know the answers. Trust yourself.”

You close your eyes for a moment, take a deep breath, and pick up your pen again. You start writing, and as you do, the blank pages begin to fill with your thoughts, ideas, and knowledge—as if the answers were there all along, waiting for you to find them.
