...accept their offer with a mix of relief and curiosity. As you walk together, the city around you begins to shift—buildings stretch and twist like living things, and the streets hum with an eerie, melodic energy. The strangers guide you to a hidden alleyway, where a door appears, glowing faintly with an otherworldly light.

One of them smiles and says, *"This is where you need to be."* You hesitate, but something deep inside you recognizes the door as familiar, as if you’ve seen it in another life. When you reach out to touch it, the door swings open on its own, revealing a vast, star-filled expanse—not a room, but a boundless night sky.

A voice whispers, *"You were never lost. You were just remembering how to find yourself."* And then, with a rush of wind, you step through—into the unknown.
