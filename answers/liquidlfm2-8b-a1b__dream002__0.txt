suddenly, the sky above clears from soft morning light into a deep, electric blue, and a chill rolls through the air—cool night winds pick up, rustling the leaves. Rain begins not with a drumbeat, but a gentle, heavy sigh, falling first as fine mist, then thick sheets, illuminating the forest floor with silver glimmers.  

The trees lean into the current, bending gracefully as lightning flashes in sharp, jagged streaks—each crack filled with thunder that rumbles like distant voices calling through the valley. Droplets fall in slow motion, wrapping the undergrowth in a veil of water, every branch dripping, every fern trembling.  

You feel a presence beyond the ordinary—a pulse beneath the earth, as if the forest itself is breathing, awakening. Then, the storm begins to shift. The wind deepens, howling, yet carries no destruction—only raw, wild beauty. From the heart of the woods, a beam of light bursts through the overcast, illuminating a hidden clearing. In it stands an ancient tree, its bark glowing faintly, roots pulsing with soft light, as if it has eyes and remembers every season.  

You step forward, drawn by the storm’s song—the wild chaos giving way to quiet harmony. The rain slows, the thunder fades, and in the hush, the forest breathes. And you understand: the storm was not an end, but a return—nature’s way of cleansing, revealing, and reminding.
