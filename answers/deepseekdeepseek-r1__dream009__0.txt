You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **master the forgotten art of fire-starting using ancient methods** to gain the trust of a wary tribe. Their village, nestled beneath a crumbling stone fortress, is shrouded in whispers of an impending curse—a drought threatening their survival. Though they eye you with suspicion, their elder recognizes the strange symbols on your clothing, murmuring of an old prophecy: *“A stranger from nowhere, bearing the mark of flame, shall reignite the heart of the mountain.”*  

The tribe’s sacred fire, kept alive for centuries, has dwindled to embers. Without it, they cannot summon the courage to ascend the forbidden peak where the “heart” (a volcanic forge) lies dormant. Your modern knowledge of geology clashes with their rituals, but to survive, you must blend science and myth. Can you decode the tribe’s star-charted maps, spark a fire without matches, and persuade them to face the mountain’s fury—or will the weight of an ancient world extinguish your chance to return home?  

The dream lingers on the edge of a choice: light the fire, or fade into legend.
