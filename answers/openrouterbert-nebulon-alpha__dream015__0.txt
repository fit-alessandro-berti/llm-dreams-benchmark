**The Last Garden**

You wake to the scent of damp earth and rusted metal, your body stiff from sleeping in the hollowed-out shell of an old bus. The world outside is a patchwork of overgrown ruins and skeletal trees, their branches clawing at a sky choked with ash. But today, something is different.

A sound.

Not the usual groans of collapsing buildings or the distant howls of scavengers, but something softer—*water*. You crawl to the bus’s broken window and see it: a narrow stream cutting through the cracked pavement, its surface glinting under the pale sun. And beside it, a single green shoot pushing through the concrete.

Your pulse quickens. *Life.*

You grab your makeshift pack—a tattered canvas sack with a chipped knife, a half-empty canteen, and a rusted spade—and step into the wasteland. The stream leads you to a crumbling parking lot, where the pavement has split open like a wound. Beneath the rubble, you find it: a forgotten garden, its rows of wilted plants still clinging to existence. A few tomatoes, their skins split from neglect. A tangle of herbs, their leaves brittle but alive. And in the center, a single apple tree, its branches heavy with fruit.

Your hands tremble as you kneel. This isn’t just food—it’s *hope*.

But then you hear it: the snap of a twig. You freeze. From the shadows of a collapsed storefront, a figure emerges—a woman in a patched-up coat, her face gaunt, her eyes sharp. She raises a crossbow, its bolt pointed at your chest.

“This is *mine*,” she growls.

You swallow hard. “I didn’t know anyone was here.”

She doesn’t lower the weapon. “Now you do.”

Silence stretches between you. Then, from the ruins behind her, a child’s voice: *“Mama, I’m hungry.”*

The woman’s grip tightens, but her eyes flicker—just for a second—toward the sound. You see the exhaustion in her stance, the way her fingers tremble. She’s starving. They both are.

You make a choice.

Slowly, you reach into your pack and pull out the last of your rations—a strip of dried meat, a handful of nuts. You set them on the ground and push them toward her.

“Take it,” you say. “I’ll help you tend the garden. We can share.”

Her eyes narrow. “Why?”

“Because no one survives alone.”

For a long moment, she doesn’t move. Then, with a sharp exhale, she lowers the crossbow. The child—a girl, no older than eight—peeks out from behind a rusted car, her eyes wide.

The woman nods. “Fine. But if you steal, I *will* shoot you.”

You almost laugh. “Deal.”

Together, you kneel in the dirt, pulling weeds, coaxing life from the earth. The child watches, then tentatively joins, her small hands patting the soil around a tomato plant. The woman—*Lena*, she tells you—teaches you which herbs are safe to eat, which roots can be boiled for medicine. You work until the sun dips low, painting the ruins in gold.

That night, you sit around a small fire, sharing a meal of roasted vegetables and the last of the meat. The child, *Mira*, falls asleep curled against her mother’s side. Lena passes you a flask of something bitter and strong—homemade liquor, she says, brewed from fermented apples.

“You’re either very brave or very stupid,” she mutters.

“Maybe both,” you admit.

She snorts, but there’s no malice in it. Then, quietly: “There’s a settlement a few days’ walk from here. They’ve got walls. A well. Maybe even a doctor.”

You stare into the fire. “You’ve never gone?”

“Too dangerous. Raiders. Mutants.” She shrugs. “But now… maybe it’s worth the risk.”

You look at Mira, her face smudged with dirt, her breathing slow and even. Then at Lena, her scars, her stubbornness, the way she watches the horizon like she’s waiting for something.

“Then we’ll go,” you say. “Together.”

She studies you for a long moment. Then, with a grunt, she tosses another branch onto the fire. “Fine. But if you slow us down, I’m leaving you behind.”

You smile. For the first time in years, the future doesn’t feel like a death sentence.

It feels like a beginning.
