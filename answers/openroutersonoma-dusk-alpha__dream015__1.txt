You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to rally a small band of survivors into a nomadic caravan, scavenging for tech relics from the old world to rebuild a semblance of civilization. Your first stop is the skeletal remains of a once-bustling city, where rusted skyscrapers lean like weary giants under a perpetual ash-gray sky. 

As you lead the group through debris-choked streets, a low growl echoes from the shadows—mutated wolves, their fur matted with glowing fungi, eyes reflecting the faint bioluminescent light from cracked vials of experimental chemicals long forgotten. You signal for silence, heart pounding, and spot a glimmer in a shattered storefront: a functional solar-powered generator, half-buried under rubble.

In this dream, survival isn't just about enduring; it's about forging hope from the ruins, one daring choice at a time. What happens next?
