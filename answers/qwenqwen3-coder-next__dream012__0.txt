You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you —  
…feel the wheel *hum* beneath your hands, not with strain, but with a deep, resonant *memory*. The wave before you doesn’t crest—it *parts*.  

Not from wind or current.  
From *intent*.

Rain stops mid-fall, suspended like scattered glass beads. The mast creaks—not with stress, but with the sound of a古老 door swinging open. Behind you, the crew exhales, shoulders dropping—not in surrender, but in recognition.

Because the sea isn’t water anymore.  
It’s *breath*.  

The dark sky above begins to shimmer—not with stars, but with *eyes*. Dozens of them, ancient and silver-lidded, watching from the void between breaths. A voice rises—not from the wind, but from the wood beneath your feet:  
**“You have held the helm long enough, Captain. The tide turns *with* you—not against you.”**

You glance down. Your hands—weathered, ink-stained, calloused from years of charts and compasses—are now wrapped in soft, root-like tendrils. They pulse, grounding you… *connecting* you. The ship shudders—not in agony, but in alignment. Every sail fills not with wind, but with *light*, pure and golden, pouring down from the sky-eyes.

One sailor—Lena, the quiet cartographer who’s never spoken above a whisper—steps forward, touches the railing, and smiles through tears.  
*“We’re not sailing through the storm, Captain,”* she says, voice clear as a bell. *“We’re sailing* ***through the dream***.”  

The horizon blooms—not with dawn, but with a tree. Vast, impossibly tall, its roots cradling continents, its crown brushing the edge of the void. Its leaves are maps of every harbor you’ve ever known… and every one you haven’t.

You turn the wheel one final time—not to steer *away*, but *inward*.  
And the ship rises, not out of the water, but *up*—through the layers of sea and sky and memory—  
toward the branches of the World-Tree.  

The last thing you hear before waking is the sound of the crew singing, softly, in perfect harmony:  
***“Hold the breath. Hold the course. Hold the line.”***

*(You wake—damp with sea-spray or sweat, hard to tell—and reach for your bedside lamp. Your fingers brush not the switch… but a single, impossibly real leaf resting on the pillow beside you. It smells of salt, old paper, and rain.)*
