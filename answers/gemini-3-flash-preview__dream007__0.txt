...decide to turn your back and walk through the nearest door, desperate for the final word. 

But as the door clicks shut behind you, the sound doesn't echo in a hallway. Instead, it vanishes into a vast, open silence. You aren't in a house anymore. You are standing on a pier that stretches infinitely into a sea of liquid silver, under a sky where three moons hang at different stages of eclipse.

The anger that felt like fire in your chest just a moment ago suddenly feels heavy and cold, like a stone in your pocket. You reach in to pull it out, but instead of a stone, you pull out a small, glowing bird made of gossamer and light. It’s the "important thing" you were both fighting over. 

You hear footsteps behind you. You turn, expecting the harsh face of your friend, but they are different now—their edges are blurred, shimmering like a heat haze. They aren't shouting anymore. They hold out their hand, and you realize they aren't reaching for the bird; they are reaching for you.

As you place the glowing bird into their palm, it bursts into a thousand tiny sparks that turn into lanterns, floating up toward the moons. The pier beneath your feet begins to dissolve into soft, white sand. The argument has lost its language. You realize you weren't fighting about the truth; you were fighting because you were both afraid of the dark.

The friend smiles, their face finally clear and kind, and as the silver sea rises to meet your ankles, you feel a profound sense of gravity letting go. You aren't standing anymore—you’re drifting upward. The last thing you hear before the dream fades is the sound of your friend’s laughter, which sounds exactly like the first day you met, echoing through the stars. 

You wake up with the word "forgive" resting on your tongue like a drop of water.
