...and you notice that the frenetic dance of color and form seems to *hesitate* around it, drawn to its perfect, unyielding blankness. It's not just white; it's a void humming with a quiet potential, a silent eye in the storm of shifting reality. As you step closer, you see the edges of the canvas aren't sharp, but seem to *breathe*, gently pulling the vibrant hues and impossible geometries *inward*. They don't stain the surface; they dissolve *into* its depth, becoming whispers of light and forgotten forms within its profound stillness.

You reach out, and your fingers don't touch cloth, but pass through a barrier of cool, expectant air. The dream realm shifts again, and you are no longer standing *before* the canvas, but *within* its infinite, quiet expanse. The external world of constant change is now a distant, colourful hum, pressing against the edges of this serene, internal void. You are the single point of awareness in a universe of pure potential, the blank canvas *is* now your world, waiting for the next impossible brushstroke of reality to unfold from within you.

And you drift there, understanding that the canvas wasn't just a thing to be filled, but a state of being, a perfect pause in the perpetual dream.
