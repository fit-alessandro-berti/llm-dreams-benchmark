# The Captain's Resolve

You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you stand firmly at the helm, the wooden wheel slick under your white-knuckled grip. Lightning fractures the black sky, illuminating terrified faces that search yours for any sign of doubt.

\d, your voice somehow carrying over the howling wind. The vessel groans as it turns, fighting against waves tall as buildings.

Below deck, something breaks loose with a crash. The first mate reports three feet of water in the hold. In your mind's eye, you see the path forward—not just through the storm, but through the fear threatening to consume your crew.

\ weathered worse,\ conviction that you almost believe it yourself. \remast! Reynolds, take five men and start bailing! Martinez, lash yourself to the mizzenmast and watch our bearing!\ leave your lips, something strange happens. The crew moves with newfound purpose, and their confidence seems to physically push back the darkness. The rain still lashes your face, but you feel an impossible warmth spreading through your chest.

The ship crests a massive wave, hanging suspended for what feels like eternity before crashing down. Instead of splintering, it cuts through the water like a blade through silk.

Suddenly, you realize the stars are appearing overhead. The storm isn't ending—you're rising above it. The ship is sailing into the sky, water streaming from its hull as your crew cheers in disbelief.

\d, \

You awaken with salt on your lips and the phantom sensation of a ship still rocking beneath you.
