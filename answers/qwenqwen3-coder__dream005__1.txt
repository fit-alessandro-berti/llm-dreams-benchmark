...each conversation pulls you deeper into the maze of unfamiliar faces and half-remembered names. 

You pause by a group discussing quantum physics with startling intensity, then another debating the merits of different pickle varieties. A woman in a feathered hat insists she's your long-lost cousin, while a man by the punch bowl claims you were childhood pen pals. 

The one person you actually know seems to keep moving through the crowd, always just out of sight around the next cluster of people. You follow glimpses of their distinctive red scarf through the shifting sea of strangers, but each time you think you've caught up, it's someone else entirely.

Eventually, you realize you're no longer sure who you were looking for in the first place. The dream gathering begins to shimmer and fade, leaving you with the peculiar sense that perhaps you were the only person you needed to find all along.

Does that capture the surreal, searching quality of dreams? What direction were you hoping the dream would take?
