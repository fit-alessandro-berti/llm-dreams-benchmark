The air is thick with warm chatter and clinking glasses. You wade through a sea of unfamiliar faces, your eyes scanning for the one anchor you have here: your friend. A group by the fireplace erupts in laughter, their heads thrown back in unison like a choreographed dance. You slip past them, offering a tight smile.

You drift into the dining room where a circle debates the merits of different coffee beans with the intensity of philosophers. One of them, a woman with bright green glasses, gestures with a half-eaten canapé, but you’re already moving on.

Then, you see a familiar silhouette through the sliding glass doors, out on the patio. Relief washes over you. You step outside into the cool night air, the noise of the party softening to a murmur.

But as you approach, you realize it’s not them. It’s a stranger, alone, looking up at the stars with the same lost expression you feel. They turn, and your eyes meet. You both smile, a silent acknowledgment of shared solitude in the crowd.

“Can’t find your person either?” they ask, their voice quiet.

You shake your head.

“Me neither. But the stars are good company.” They gesture to the sky.

You look up. The Milky Way is a dusty splash across the velvet black, clearer here away from the city lights. For a moment, you forget your search. You stand there, two strangers sharing a silent, celestial spectacle.

From inside, you hear your name called. You turn and finally see your friend, waving from the kitchen doorway. You glance back at the stranger.

“Go on,” they say, their smile genuine. “I’ll be here with the constellations.”

You nod, a new warmth in your chest. As you walk back toward the noise and light, you carry with you the quiet of the patio, the unexpected kinship, and the vast, glittering sky. The dream isn't just about finding what you lost; it's about what you find when you're lost.
