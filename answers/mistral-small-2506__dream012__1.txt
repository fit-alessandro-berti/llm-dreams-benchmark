**The Dream Continues...**

The storm howls around you, the ship groaning under the weight of the waves. The crew’s faces are pale, their eyes wide with fear, but they stand firm, waiting for your command. The wind whips your cloak, and the rain stings your skin like needles.

You grip the wheel, feeling the ship’s spirit beneath your hands—strong, but straining. The horizon is a blur of black and silver, the sky and sea merging into a chaotic dance of fury.

Then, through the chaos, you see it—a flicker of light. Not from the storm, but something deeper, something *alive*. A voice, faint but insistent, whispers on the wind.

*"Steer into the heart of the tempest."*

Your crew exchanges uneasy glances. The first mate shouts over the roar, *"Captain, we can’t hold much longer!"*

You hesitate. The storm is a monster, but monsters can be tamed—or outrun. The light pulses again, brighter now, like a beacon calling you forward.

**What do you do?**

1. **Steer into the storm**—Trust the voice and plunge deeper, seeking the source of the light.
2. **Turn and flee**—Order the crew to tack away, hoping to outrun the worst of the tempest.
3. **Drop anchor and weather the storm**—Hold position, bracing the ship against the waves until the fury passes.
4. **Something else?** (Describe your choice.)

The dream is yours to shape. What path will you take?
