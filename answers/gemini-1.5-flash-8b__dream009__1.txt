You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around.  Dust motes danced in the pale sunlight filtering through the gaps in the thatch roof.  The air smelled of woodsmoke and something faintly sweet, like overripe berries.  Rough-hewn wooden buildings, their walls a patchwork of mud and wattle, lined a narrow cobbled street.  Horseshoes clinked rhythmically on the stone.  The people, dressed in simple tunics and breeches, stared at you with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.  A child, no older than five, tugged at your sleeve, their eyes wide with wonder.  You felt disoriented, your modern clothes stiff and unfamiliar against your skin.  Your watch, your phone, your memory of everything you knew were gone.  You realized you were utterly lost in time.

You needed to **find a way to communicate, to understand the language of this place, and figure out how to survive without the tools you'd always taken for granted.**  You needed to learn the customs, the ways of this new world.  A sudden gnawing hunger reminded you that you needed food and shelter.  Your gaze fell on a small, worn-out book tucked beneath a stack of woven baskets.  It looked like a recipe book, its pages filled with strange symbols and drawings of unfamiliar plants.  Perhaps this was the key to understanding not just the food, but the entire culture.  The child's gaze lingered on you, and you felt a tiny flicker of hope. Maybe, just maybe, you could find a way to belong here, to learn to live again.
