and every cluster is its own weather. In the foyer, a chandelier breathes like a sleeping animal and the light shifts as though clouds are passing inside it. The first group you meet are dressed as constellations without costumes: someone’s freckles align into Orion, a woman’s braid loops like a galaxy, a man lifts his glass and the ice refracts into tiny Pleiades on the ceiling. They are telling secrets in the names of stars, soft syllables that you nearly understand. When you ask if they’ve seen your friend, a person with comet-white hair says, “They’re between the stair and its shadow,” and taps the banister that doesn’t cast one.

You find the staircase anyway, and it is carpeted with moss that leaves your footprints glowing for a few heartbeats before fading. On the landing is a table and around the table are people passing items that keep changing shape: a salt shaker that becomes an hourglass, a stack of coasters that becomes a deck of photographs of rooms you’ve never been in. “Flip it,” says a man whose laugh always arrives one second too early. You flip the hourglass and everyone’s last sentence un-says itself and flutters back into their mouths like birds returning to their nests. You try to ask about your friend twice and both times your question loses its feathers midair and falls apart.

In the kitchen the counters curve like a shoreline. Steam rises off a pot and makes little islands out of the ceiling. People lean against the fridge and speak in recipes that have no ingredients: “Fold the afternoon into itself,” says someone wearing an apron embroidered with invisible thread. A woman with lipstick the color of pomegranates presses a napkin into your palm. On it, in a handwriting you almost remember, is written, I am by the coat mountain. When you look up to thank her, she is pouring water from the faucet into a vase, and the water comes out already filled with lilies.

The coat mountain is not a closet but a landscape. It is a hill of wool and velvet and rain, smelling like all the weathers that have ever been trapped in fabric. People climb it slowly and slide down laughing. You wade in, parting sleeves like tall grass, and somewhere a zipper moves against another zipper and makes a whisper like your name. Your hand lands on a sleeve that is the exact weight of a memory. You pull it up and find a pocket with a second napkin. Find the room where the music forgets to play, it says.

The music everywhere is a surface tension, a thin film holding the party together. You drift through conversations like someone walking through shallow water, waist-deep in laughter, occasionally touched by a tide of perfumed air. On the balcony, people exhale smoke that becomes soap bubbles, and the bubbles drift into the night and pop with tiny bell sounds that fall back into the garden. Someone holds out their palm and asks you to choose a color. The colors glitter like fish. You choose a green that tastes exactly like biting the stem of a leaf. “Your friend is always on this balcony,” says the person, “when you are not looking for them.”

Inside again, you find a room filled with instruments that no one is playing. Their strings hum a little from the party’s footsteps. A cello leans against the wall as if listening with its whole body. A piano has its lid open like a mouth catching light. In the corner sits a small radio whispering to itself. When you step in, the music from the rest of the house thins and then, for a breath, forgets to exist. The silence is thick and soft. On the piano bench is another napkin: Listening to the staircase breathe.

You go back. Halfway up, you stop and wait. At first you hear only people, the clink of ice, the vowels of your own name from another room. Then a new sound, hidden and steady: the staircase inhaling, exhaling, the wood expanding and shrinking with the temperature of the gathering, every footstep a small lung. There’s a group sitting on the steps, their knees touching, trading photographs of doorways. A man hands you one with a question mark drawn where the knob should be. “Have you tried the hall of wrong shoes?” he asks. “Everyone gets where they’re going faster if they wear something that almost fits.”

The hall of wrong shoes is a narrow corridor lined with racks. People sit on benches and lace up boots that belong to other moods. You slide your feet into a pair of satin flats that remember dancing better than you do. At the far end, two French doors are propped open with a stack of hardback books titled Any Minute Now. Beyond them is a small room lit as if by a lamp inside your chest. The walls are covered in frames, and in the frames are little moving scenes of you arriving in other places—late trains, bright kitchens, childhood porches. On a low table there is a bowl of keys that are too warm to be metal. You pick one up and it leaves an imprint on your palm like a pressed leaf. Another napkin is folded beneath the bowl. It reads: I am the person who will look like everyone else when you are afraid.

You try to think of all the faces you’ve seen so far: the constellation freckles, the pomegranate mouth, the man with early laughter, the voice inside the staircase. You realize you’ve been collecting versions of them. When you step back into the main room, you are briefly certain you could point to anyone and say their name. A woman with a scar shaped like a comma turns to you and says, “Left, then left, then left,” as if finishing your thought. You follow her directions and end up in a garden room where the walls are painted birds. The painted birds hop from wall to wall when no one looks at them directly, so you pretend to glance past and they flutter in your peripheral vision.

It is here you find a group humming one note together, eyes closed. The note vibrates through your ribs and finds an answering note in something unseen. “The house’s heart,” says a person who might be asleep while speaking. “It beats when we remember it has one.” As they hum, you feel a moving in the floorboards beneath your feet, a gentle pulse. Somewhere inside the rhythm, someone says your name how your friend says it: with the little lift at the end as if it is a question and an answer.

The crowd shifts. People part in that slow, natural way that is only choreographed by accident. Through the space you glimpse the back of a head you know the shape of. Your breath does that soft falling thing. You step forward and the room steps sideways, as rooms do in dreams. You reach the spot and a stranger turns to you wearing your friend’s smile. Then another stranger with their laugh. Then a child who tugs your sleeve with their sleeve. “You dropped this,” the child says, handing you nothing, and into your palm falls the feeling of being found.

By now you are a little tired of looking. You sit on the edge of a fountain that appears where a table was. The water doesn’t ripple; it remembers itself perfectly. You dip your fingers and pull out a paper boat you’ve never seen before. On its side, in that same almost-familiar handwriting, is written: Stop walking like a question. Let where you are find you.

So you do. You stop moving. You let conversations flow around you like a river you’re standing in. You let your eyes rest on the way the chandelier breathes, on the moss remembering your feet, on the wall-birds trading places. You think of your friend not as a location but as a way the room feels when they’re in it. The feeling is a temperature. It is a frequency. It is the particular way the air pulls in around a name.

When you look up, they are there as if they have been walking toward you from the correct direction this whole time. They look exactly like they always have and also like a story you’ve been telling yourself about light. The relief is not a crashing thing but a settling, a book closing, a door swung from both sides at once. You reach out and touch the sleeve of their jacket and it is your sleeve because you borrowed it months ago and never returned it. “There you are,” they say, and you both smile the same surprised smile, as if meeting wasn’t the point and yet somehow it was.

Around you the party keeps rearranging itself into new ways of being the same evening. You stand together. You don’t have to say anything for a while. The heartbeat of the house leans back into silence. Somewhere, between the stair and its shadow, the night inhales and for a moment forgets to exhale, holding you both at the top of the breath. Then it lets go and you float, and everything, like the coat mountain, like the wrong shoes, like the soap bubbles that bell the air, settles into the particular kind of dream that knows exactly when to end.
