speak—but instead of words, a deep, resonant *hum* fills the room. The sound vibrates through the floorboards, through the chairs, through the very air, and suddenly, the audience begins to *glow*. Not with light, but with something deeper: their outlines blur, their faces shifting like reflections in water, and you realize—*they aren’t human*.

The hum isn’t coming from you. It’s coming from *them*. The crowd sways in unison, their voices weaving into a chorus of whispers, and the stage beneath your feet dissolves into soft, black sand. You look down—your hands are translucent, flickering like candle flames. A voice (your own? theirs?) echoes in your mind: *"You were never here to speak. You were here to listen."*

Then, one by one, the figures in the audience begin to rise, floating just above their seats. Their forms stretch and twist, revealing shapes beneath their human disguises—geometric, organic, impossible. A figure in the front row unfurls into a spiral of eyes; another splits into a fractal of wings. The hum crescendos, and you understand, without words, that they’ve been waiting for *you*—not for your speech, but for the moment you’d realize the truth:

**This was never a dream. It was a memory.**

And then—
*(What happens next?)*
- The stage collapses into a vortex, and you’re pulled into a sky full of constellations that rearrange themselves into a language you somehow know.
- The crowd parts, and a single figure steps forward—a version of *you*, but older, wearing a smile that isn’t quite human. They press a key into your palm and whisper, *"Wake up now. But not here."*
- The hum sharpens into a single, piercing note, and the world *inverts*—suddenly, *you* are the audience, and the crowd is a single, towering figure on the stage, staring back at you with your own face.
- The sand beneath you gives way, and you fall—not down, but *sideways*, into a corridor lined with doors, each labeled with a date from your life. One of them is glowing.
