You are participating in a competition where the grand prize is your dream job. As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and puzzles that push your limits, each more surreal than the last. In the final trial, you stand before a mirror that reflects not your current self, but the person you aspire to become. A voice echoes: "To claim the prize, you must step into your future." With a deep breath, you walk through the glass, and suddenly you're holding the job offer. But as you unfold the paper, the dream fades, and you wake up—inspired, knowing that the real competition begins now, and you're ready.
