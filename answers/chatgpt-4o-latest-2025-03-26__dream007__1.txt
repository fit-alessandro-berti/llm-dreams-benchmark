take a walk to cool down. As you step outside, the world around you begins to shift subtly—trees blur at the edges, the pavement seems to shimmer. The air hums softly, as if holding its breath.

You walk along a winding path through a forest that wasn’t there before, the argument still heavy in your chest. Suddenly, the path splits in two: one direction leads toward a hazy city skyline, pulsing with distant lights; the other dips into a quiet valley filled with glowing flowers.

You hesitate, then choose the valley. As you descend, the scent of lavender and something sweeter—like memory—envelops you. In the center of the valley stands a mirror, tall and ancient, framed in twisted vines. You see your reflection, but it’s not quite you—it’s the version of yourself from years ago, before the argument became a dividing line.

The reflection places its hand against the glass, and without thinking, you match the gesture. Instantly, your mind floods with the moment when you and your friend first bonded—laughing, building something out of nothing, when understanding felt effortless.

You look behind you and find your friend standing at the edge of the valley.

Neither of you speak. The mirror begins to dissolve into mist, and with it, the tension seems to lift. You walk toward each other—still different, still unsure—but there’s a quiet willingness now to listen, to begin again.

And just before you wake, you reach out…and they don’t pull away.
