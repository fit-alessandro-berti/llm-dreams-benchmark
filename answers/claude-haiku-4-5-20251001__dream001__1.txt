# The Dream Continues

...frantically patting my pockets, finding only lint and a business card that keeps changing text every time I look at it.

The streets around me shift subtly—buildings breathe, sidewalks curve upward like they might loop back on themselves. I spot a taxi, but when I wave it down, the driver's face is obscured by shadow, and they wordlessly hand me a map that's entirely blank except for a single red dot that pulses.

I ask, \ this where I need to go?\ my voice sounds muffled, like I'm speaking underwater.

A stranger beside me—familiar somehow, though I can't place them—says the meeting is actually three cities over, or maybe it was yesterday, they're not sure. When I look back at them, they've vanished.

I start running, my legs feeling heavy and slow despite my urgency. The clock tower ahead shows multiple times at once. My phone buzzes with notifications I can't quite read, and I have this overwhelming sense that I'm late, except...

*Something shifts*. A part of me realizes none of this matters. The panic begins to dissolve into curiosity instead.

What happens next? Do you want me to take it somewhere particular?
