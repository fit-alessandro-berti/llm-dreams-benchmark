You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you feel the weight of their trust pressing against your chest like a vice. The sky is a bruised purple, cracked with veins of lightning that stitch the darkness into jagged fragments. The wind howls through the rigging, a cacophony of screams, and the waves rise like serpents, their crests crowned with foam that glints like teeth.  

Your hands grip the wheel, knuckles white, as the ship lurches sideways, the deck groaning beneath your feet. A crewman shouts something incomprehensible over the gale, but you don’t need words—your instincts are a compass now. You’ve sailed these waters before, but never like this. The storm feels alive, a sentient thing clawing at the hull, testing your resolve.  

Then, a crack. The mainmast splinters, wood shattering like brittle bone. Chaos erupts: shouts, the crash of falling rigging, the sickening lurch of the ship as it tilts into a trough. You bellow orders, your voice a roar against the storm, but the wind steals your words. Your crew—brave, terrified, human—scatters to secure the deck, their faces lit by the flicker of lanterns swaying like dervishes.  

A wave, taller than the ship itself, looms on the horizon. It’s not just water—it’s a wall of fury, a thing of myth. You see it, and in that moment, you’re not a captain anymore. You’re a boy again, watching your father’s ship vanish into the same maw. But this time, you *choose* to fight.  

You throw the wheel hard to port, feeling the ship’s bones creak in protest. The wave crashes down, and for a heartbeat, you’re submerged in a world of salt and screaming. Then—*up*. The ship breaches the crest, water cascading off the deck in a silver deluge. The crew is drenched, gasping, but alive.  

The storm doesn’t relent. But as you steady the wheel, you notice something: the lightning no longer strikes the ship. It arcs around it, as if the tempest itself hesitates. You glance at the horizon, where the sky begins to bleed into dawn. The storm is retreating.  

Your crew collapses in relief, but you stand motionless, staring at the sea. In the distance, a figure appears—a silhouette on the water, beckoning. You know, in your dream-heart, that this is no ordinary storm. It was a test. And you passed.  

But as the first rays of sun pierce the clouds, you wonder: was the storm *real* at all? Or was it a mirror, reflecting the chaos you’ve carried inside all along?  

The dream fades, but the salt stays on your skin.
