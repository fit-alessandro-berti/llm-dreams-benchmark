freak out slightly, your heart pounding in your chest. The towering buildings seem to loom closer, casting long, ambiguous shadows across the pristine, almost unnervingly clean streets. There are no landmarks you recognize, just a confusing maze of architectural styles – futuristic glass towers beside weathered, medieval structures.

You start to walk quickly, ignoring the nearby cafes and bustling shops, desperate to find a sign, a helpful passerby, *anything*. Your eyes scan every face, hoping to catch a familiar language or friendly expression, but they all seem preoccupied with their own paths.

Then, you notice a street sign etched subtly into the pavement just ahead. It glows with a soft, internal light, listing the names of three intersecting thoroughfares you've never heard of. It's an odd detail, and for a moment, you feel a strange pull, as if the sign itself is watching you. You stop, breathing heavily, and look at your watch – the hour is quickly slipping away. Panic mixes with the surreal quality of the place, making your search feel both urgent and dreamlike. You start to rush down a side street, hoping for a clue, terrified of being late, completely lost in this impossible city.
