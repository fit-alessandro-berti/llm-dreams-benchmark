…the trees around you *breathe*—a deep, resonant sigh that ripples through the canopy like a wave. The sky doesn’t darken slowly; it *shatters*. One moment, soft gold light filters through the oaks; the next, the heavens crack open in a silent, impossible fracture—a jagged line of pure silver light splits the sky, not with thunder, but with a sound like a thousand glass bells chiming in reverse.

The wind doesn’t howl. It *sings*—a low, haunting harmony in five-part harmony, carrying the scent of ozone, petrichor, and something older… like burnt honey and forgotten libraries.

You stumble, but your feet don’t sink into mud. They sink into *starlight*. The forest floor softens, becoming a cool, glowing moss that pulses faintly, bioluminescent and impossibly alive. Above, the fractured sky reveals not clouds, but * constellations* that twist and rearrange themselves—Orion’s belt forming a keyhole, Cassiopeia folding inward like a closing hand—locking onto you.

Then, the first “raindrop” falls.

It doesn’t fall *down*. It *hovers*, suspended inches above your palm—a single, perfect sphere of liquid light, shimmering with all the colors of a dying firework. As it touches your skin, it doesn’t wet you. It *ignites* inside you—not with heat, but with clarity. A memory surfaces: *You built this forest once, eons ago, from the echoes of a song you forgot you sang.*

A figure steps out from behind an ancient, silver-barked tree—not walking, but *unfolding* from the space between the trunks. They wear robes woven from shadow and dawn mist, their face obscured by a hood, but you know them. You’ve met them in every dream since childhood.

They extend a hand—not toward you, but *through* you. In their palm rests a single, trembling seed, no bigger than your thumb, made of folded twilight and humming wire.

The storm isn’t coming to destroy.

It’s coming to *remember*.

And you—standing barefoot in the glowing moss, the starlight singing in your veins—realize with a jolt of awe:  
*You’re not lost. You’re home.*  

You reach for the seed.  
And the world holds its breath.  

*(The dream deepens… What do you do?)* 🌱✨
