you feel an irresistible pull to touch it. As soon as your fingers graze the surface, ripples spread outward like water disturbed by a stone, and images begin to bloom across the canvas. At first, they’re simple—circles that turn into suns, lines that twist into trees—but then the entire scene spills out from the canvas and begins reshaping the world around you.  

Mountains rise like origami unfolding, their slopes streaming with liquid light. The ground shifts beneath your feet, softening into a quilt of stars that glow and wink as though they know secrets you have yet to uncover. Overhead, the sky melts from deep violet into hues you don’t have names for—colors that sing in your mind instead of resting in your eyes.  

Suddenly, you realize the canvas isn’t just something *separate* from you—it’s responding to your thoughts. Every fleeting image in your imagination leaves a mark. When you picture a door, it materializes: tall, arched, shimmering with possibility. Its surface flickers, as if thousands of choices lie just beyond it.  

You sense that opening it will take you somewhere… perhaps into another layer of this dream, or into something even stranger, where your thoughts won’t just shape the world but weave its laws entirely.  

Would you like to **step through the door**, or do you prefer to **stay and paint more of the shifting landscape**?
