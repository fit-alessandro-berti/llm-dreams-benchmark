You stand immobilized in the maze of steel and humming traffic, the cityâ€™s glare sharpening your anxiety. Thenâ€”a murmur of voices. Around you, strangers cluster like constellations, their faces lit by cafÃ© glow and streetlampâ€™s gold. A woman hums a tune as she adjusts her violin strap, beside a college student clutching a map scribbled with "Stops? Nearest restroom?!" A suitcloset-stunty man hands you a tiny compass, while a grandmotherly lady gestures with her enameled tray, saying, *"We wonâ€™t have yâ€™all lost again until lunch."*

She offers to walk you to the stationâ€”*the place your uncle says has the best cookies*â€”but you hesitate. Panic prickles your spine. The strangers exchange glances, then smile warmly. *"Seems like someone needs a map,"* the violinist say. They pull you into a nearby park bench, propping you there as they lay out a half-eaten cookie. *"First, tell me: are you here for airfrieght...?"* The baker asks, peering over their baked goods. You admit youâ€™re lost but also starving. 

Tension eases. The woman with the violin navigates alleys past a street art mural of dinosaurs, finally leading you to a bus stop where night buses loop like moths to a flame. "My granddadâ€™s a driver for that route," pronounces the lady with the tray. "Heâ€™ll drop you at the library by midnight." 

But as you scramble onto the second-story window to reach the library, the compass slips. Heart racing, you grab the violinâ€™s strapâ€”*ah!* The musicianâ€™s finger plucks her tune, and her face breaks into a grin. She zips you down the crowded stairs. 

You reach the libraryâ€™s glowing exit just as doors clanged shut behind you. Inside, your uncleâ€™s voice booms from the stairwell: *"Time for garlic bread and adventure?"* 

The strangers disperse, but the woman with the violin stays until you reach the safety of her violin case. Behind you, the city exhales, its lights dimming like a waking dream. You turn, smiling at her. *"Next time Iâ€™ll bring wine for the subway ride."* 

She nods, and as she turns to go, you feel the weight of strangersâ€™ kindness in your bones. The dream ends hereâ€”but in waking life, you remember that strangers are often stars in your own journeys. ðŸŒŸ
