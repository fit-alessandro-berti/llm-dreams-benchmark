feel a wave of confidence surge through me. I clear my throat, adjust the microphone, and begin to speak: "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being here today. I'm honored to share my thoughts on..." Wait, what were my thoughts on? The topic slips away like sand through my fingers. I glance down at my notes, but they're blank—completely blank, just a sea of white paper staring back at me.

The crowd, once expectant, starts to murmur. Their faces blur and shift in that weird, dreamlike way, morphing from attentive listeners into familiar strangers: my old high school teacher, a childhood pet that's suddenly human, and even a version of myself from years ago, all staring with growing impatience. I try to improvise, saying, "Uh, on the importance of... dreams? Yeah, dreams are... important?" But my voice echoes unnaturally, bouncing off the walls like it's in a vast, empty stadium.

Suddenly, the stage starts to tilt. The floor beneath me feels like it's made of jelly, wobbling with each step I take. I reach out to steady myself, but my hand passes right through the podium—it's not solid at all. Panic rises in my chest as the audience begins to laugh, but it's not a cruel laugh; it's synchronized, like a chorus of wind chimes. Then, one by one, they stand up and join me on the stage, their clothes turning into colorful balloons that float upward, carrying them away.

I try to follow, leaping after them, but I'm rooted in place. The room expands infinitely, stars twinkling in the ceiling like a night sky. And just as I'm about to give up, I realize I'm not scared anymore. I shout into the void, "This is my dream—I can say anything!" The words turn into fireworks, exploding in brilliant colors above me.

Then, everything fades to black, and I wake up in my bed, heart racing, with a strange sense of accomplishment. What a wild dream that was.
