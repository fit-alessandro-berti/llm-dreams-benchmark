They seem to shift when you blink, as though alive—spirals, celestial constellations, and unfamiliar script that hums softly under your fingertips. The air around the box grows colder, and you feel a pull, like the metal is breathing in time with your heartbeat.  

As you press your palm against the center of the design, the symbols flare bright, and the box *sighs* open, not with a click or a creak, but a sound like a distant memory being remembered. Inside lies a single, iridescent key—though as you reach for it, the box’s interior expands, revealing a vast, starlit void. Planets orbit within its depths, and a tiny, glowing figure waves from behind a miniature moon.  

You realize, with a start, that the key isn’t in the box at all—it’s *you*. The symbols on your skin now mirror those on the box, and the figure in the void begins to run, tugging at the moon’s chains. The box trembles, demanding a choice: to take the key and unlock a door you can’t yet see, or to let the box close, returning you to the world you knew.  

As the dream fractures at the edges, you hear a whisper: *"Some locks are meant to find the key, not the other way around."*
