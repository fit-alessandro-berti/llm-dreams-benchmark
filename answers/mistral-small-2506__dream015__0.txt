**Dream Sequence:**

You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **venture into the ruins of an old city**, hoping to find supplies or survivors.

The air is thick with dust and the scent of decay. Crumbling skyscrapers loom like skeletal giants, their windows shattered, their interiors swallowed by darkness. You move cautiously, your boots crunching over broken glass and rusted metal. The silence is eerie—only the distant howl of a mutated creature breaks the stillness.

As you step into the shadow of a collapsed bridge, you notice something glinting in the rubble. A **rusted metal box**, half-buried under debris. Your heart races as you dig it out. Inside, you find a **handwritten journal** and a **small, intact vial of medicine**. The journal’s pages are brittle, but the last entry is legible:

*"If you’re reading this, the world is gone. But not all hope is lost. There’s a safe haven in the mountains—follow the old railway tracks north. Trust no one, but don’t give up."*

A sudden noise—footsteps. You freeze. From the alleyway, a **figure emerges**, cloaked in tattered rags, their face obscured by a scarf. They raise a hand in a gesture of peace or warning—you can’t tell.

Do you:
1. **Approach cautiously**, ready to fight or flee?
2. **Hide and observe**, waiting to see their intentions?
3. **Run**, trusting your instincts to escape?

*(What happens next is up to you…)*
