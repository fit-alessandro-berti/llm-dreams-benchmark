You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the sky darkens to an unnatural shade of purple, like bruised fruit hanging low overhead. The wind picks up, whispering secrets through the leaves—secrets that sound suspiciously like your own forgotten childhood memories, murmured in voices you haven't heard in years.

You quicken your pace, but the path ahead twists unnaturally, looping back on itself like a Möbius strip. Rain begins to fall, not in drops, but in shimmering silver threads that weave themselves into the air, forming ethereal webs that catch the light of distant lightning. One bolt strikes nearby, and instead of thunder, you hear a chorus of laughter echoing from the trees. The forest is alive now, the trunks pulsing with veins of glowing sap, and the branches reach out like curious fingers, brushing against your skin.

Seeking shelter, you spot an ancient oak with a hollow at its base, large enough to crawl into. As you squeeze inside, the storm rages outside, but within the tree, time seems to stretch and bend. The hollow expands into a vast chamber, walls lined with shelves of forgotten dreams—glass jars filled with swirling colors, labeled with things like "The Day You Learned to Fly" or "Whispers from the Ocean Floor." You reach for one, and suddenly you're not in the tree anymore; you're soaring above the forest on wings made of storm clouds, the rain tasting like honey on your tongue.

Below, the forest transforms into a city of living vines and flower-towers, where animals in top hats discuss philosophy with birds. But the storm isn't done with you. A massive wave of wind sweeps you down, and you tumble into a clearing where the sun breaks through, impossibly bright. There, in the center, stands a mirror that reflects not your face, but a version of yourself from another life—older, wiser, holding out a key.

As you take it, the dream shifts again. The storm fades, the forest returns to peace, but now the trees are whispering your name, urging you to wake. You feel a gentle pull, like gravity reversing, and your eyes flutter open to the real world... or is it? The key is still clutched in your hand, cold and real against your palm. What door does it open? The dream lingers, inviting you back whenever you close your eyes.
