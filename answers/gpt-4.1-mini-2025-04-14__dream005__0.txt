engage in brief conversations that feel both strangely familiar and oddly surreal. One group is gathered around a glowing, floating orb that seems to pulse with gentle music, their faces illuminated by its soft light. You try to step closer, but the orb drifts away just out of reach, leading you down a winding corridor lined with shimmering curtains.

As you follow, the crowd begins to blur and fade like dissolving mist, replaced by whispering voices that echo your own name. You realize your surroundings have shifted—you’re now in a vast garden under a sky painted with shifting colors, where the stars twinkle like distant memories.

In the distance, you spot your one known companion, standing beside an ancient tree that seems to hum with life. As you approach, the tree’s branches stretch downward, forming a doorway made of leaves and light, inviting you both to step through into the next part of the dream.
