and you can smell the electricity before you hear the first thunderclap. Leaves, moments ago still, begin to whisper and then shout as the wind threads its fingers through them. The sky, which had been a benevolent blue, bruises purple and green, swirling like a great eye slowly opening.

You look around for shelter and notice, with the peculiar clarity that only dreams have, that the trees have unfurled their roots and begun to walk. They gather in a circle around you, their branches bending protectively. Rain starts to fall but the droplets are warm and luminous, ticking off your skin like soft bells. Each one that hits the ground sprouts a tiny mushroom, and in the span of a heartbeat the forest floor is a carpet of bioluminescent caps.

A stag with antlers made of lightning steps into the clearing. It bows its head, and when it exhales, its breath becomes mist that forms a staircase up into the churning clouds. Something inside you knows that if you climb, you'll ride the storm itself. You put your foot on the first step; it feels as solid as memory. Above, shapes move in the clouds — ships, whales, maybe entire cities — silhouettes flickering in the flashes.

You climb. The wind lifts you gently, almost cradling you. At the top, you are standing on the back of the storm. From here, the world below is a patchwork of forest and light, and the rain is falling in slow motion. Lightning arcs out like golden veins, and you realize it's not meant to frighten but to connect, to stitch the sky to the earth.

The stag appears beside you again, now the size of a mountain, and speaks without words. "You are not caught in the storm," it tells you. "You are the calm in its center." You breathe in, and the clouds breathe with you. When you exhale, the storm begins to dissolve, its energy pouring back into the trees that gently settle their roots. The rain stops, the mushrooms retract, the sky clears into a dawn that smells of wet earth and new beginnings.

You blink, and the forest melts into the patterns on your ceiling. You are awake, heart beating like distant thunder, the echo of leaves rustling still in your ears. For a moment, you half expect to see luminous droplets fall from your bedside lamp, and smile, because you can almost feel the wind on your face.
