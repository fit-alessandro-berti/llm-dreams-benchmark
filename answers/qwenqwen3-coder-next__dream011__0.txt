…written in shifting ink—bleeding across the page like watercolor in the rain. One moment, the question reads:  
**“Define the soul’s gravitational constant.”**  
The next, it becomes:  
**“What color does silence taste when the clock is broken?”**  

Your pencil hovers, trembling. The invigilator—a tall figure with no face, only a constellation of freckles mapping forgotten constellations—taps a ruler against the podium. *Tap. Tap-tap.* Each beat makes the ink ripple, reforming new questions:  

> **“How many seconds does it take to unlearn a language you were born speaking?”**  
>  
> **“Draw the shape of regret when it’s almost forgiveness.”**  
>  
> **“If you erase your name from the roll call, does the universe still remember your voice?”**  

Your hands begin to glow faintly blue—just like the ink. You realize, with sudden clarity, that the exam isn’t graded. It’s *calibrating*. Every answer you *almost* write is a version of yourself being erased, reimagined, offered back to the universe as raw potential.  

The final question appears, written in what looks like your own handwriting—but older, wiser:  
> **“What will you choose to carry forward—and what will you gently leave behind?”**  

You look up. The classroom walls are dissolving into a library with no ceilings, shelves stretching into aurora borealis light. Students around you aren’t scribbling answers—they’re folding their papers into origami cranes, releasing them into a slow updraft of golden dust.  

One crane lands in your palm, warm. As it unfolds, it reveals only a single word, shimmering:  
**“Begin.”**  

The bell doesn’t ring.  
It *sings*.  

And suddenly, you’re not in a classroom anymore.  
You’re standing on a bridge made of starlight, about to step forward—  
—and the exam?  
It was never about knowing the right answer.  
It was about learning how to *ask better questions*.  

🌙 *Dream ends with the scent of old paper and distant rain.*
