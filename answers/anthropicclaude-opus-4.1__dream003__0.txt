...symbols that seem to shift and breathe like living things. The patterns look like constellations one moment, then flowing water the next, then writing in a language you almost understand but can't quite grasp.

Your fingers trace along the carved grooves, and wherever you touch, the box grows warm and begins to emit a soft, golden glow. You realize the lock isn't meant for a key at all—it's responding to something else entirely.

A memory surfaces, though it's not quite yours—someone singing a wordless melody. You find yourself humming it, and as you do, the box begins to resonate with the tune, vibrating gently in your hands. The patterns rearrange themselves into a spiral that draws your eye inward, deeper and deeper, until you're not looking at the box anymore but somehow looking *through* it.

Inside, there's no treasure or object, but instead a view—a window to a vast library where the books are writing themselves, their pages turning in an unfelt wind. You reach through the impossible opening, and your hand grasps something that feels like crystallized starlight. As you pull it back through, the box dissolves into butterflies made of paper and light, each one carrying a single word of a story you've yet to tell.

You're left holding only the starlight, which whispers: "Now you are the key."
