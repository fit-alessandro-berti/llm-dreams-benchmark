…and feel an inexplicable pull toward it, as though the entire shifting world has paused to watch what you might create. The canvas is impossibly smooth, glowing faintly from within, and when you lift your hand, you notice that your fingertips are dripping with color—liquid hues that weren’t there a moment ago.

As the first drop touches the canvas, it blooms like a living thing. Shapes unfold, stretching outward in slow spirals. The world around you responds: the sky ripples, the ground vibrates with a soft hum, and colors you’ve never seen before gather around your feet like curious animals.

A figure begins to emerge from your strokes—though you’re not painting so much as guiding something that already wanted to appear. It’s tall, fluid, shifting through forms: a bird, a flame, a branching tree, a face with eyes like polished mirrors. It steps out of the canvas, its body made of the same shimmering substance as the dream-world itself.

“Creator,” it says without moving its mouth. “Walk with me.”

The canvas dissolves into a pathway of light. You follow, feeling the world settle into momentary clarity: a forest made of floating triangles, rivers of liquid sunset, mountains folding and unfolding like origami breathing.

Then the figure stops and turns to you.
“Here, your thoughts shape reality. What you imagine becomes form. What form do you choose next?”

The landscape holds its breath, waiting for your answer.
