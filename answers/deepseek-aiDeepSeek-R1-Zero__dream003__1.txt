As you run your fingers along the patterns, some of the symbols begin to glow softly, and you realize that the patterns might be a part of a hidden mechanism. You spend some time rearranging and aligning the symbols until, with a satisfying click, the box opens. Inside, you find an old, ornate key that seems to be made of a shimmering, unknown metal. As you pick up the key, you wake up, wondering what that key might unlock in your waking life."}
