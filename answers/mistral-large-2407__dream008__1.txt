As you sit down at your desk, the clock on the wall begins to tick louder and louder, each swing of the pendulum echoing like a hammer blow. You open the project folder, and the papers inside are blank, except for the deadline stamped in bold, red letters: "DUE IN FIVE MINUTES."

Panic starts to rise, but you decide to give it your best shot. As you begin to type, the keys on your keyboard start to move and rearrange themselves like a living puzzle. You try to chase them with your fingers, but they slip away, always one step ahead.

Suddenly, your coffee mug floats off the desk and hovers in mid-air. It tilts, pouring a stream of coffee onto the keyboard. But instead of causing a short circuit, the coffee transforms into a swirling vortex of ideas. Images, graphs, and perfectly formatted text flow from the vortex onto your screen, creating the project report at an astonishing speed.

Your boss, who has been standing behind you the whole time, lets out an impressed whistle. The clock on the wall stops ticking, and the hands spin backwards, giving you more time. The office around you transforms into a lush garden, with desks turning into picnic tables and computers into blooming flowers.

Your colleagues join you, laughing and applauding, as the project deadline floats away like a helium balloon. You take a bow, feeling a sense of relief and accomplishment. Just then, an alarm goes off. You look around, confused, before realizing it's your alarm clock. You wake up, the dream fading away, but the sense of accomplishment lingers as you start your day.
