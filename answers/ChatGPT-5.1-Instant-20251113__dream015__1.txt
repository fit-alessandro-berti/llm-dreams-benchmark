…keep moving, trusting that motion itself is the only thing keeping you alive. The sky above is a dull, bruised violet, the kind that makes it impossible to tell the time. You step over the cracked remains of a highway divider and feel the wind push dust against your face like a warning.

Despite the hardships, you decide to **help the next living thing you encounter**, no matter who or what it is. You don’t know why this vow rises inside you now—maybe exhaustion, maybe desperation, maybe the thin, persistent ember of hope that refuses to die.

Minutes—or hours—later, you spot a faint orange glow flickering between collapsed buildings. Someone has built a fire. You move cautiously closer, hand on the scavenged tool at your belt, only to find a small child sitting beside the flame, their clothes torn but their eyes bright and alert. They look up at you without fear, as if they’ve been expecting you.

“I knew you’d come,” the child says. “I dreamed about you.”

The words freeze you. You’ve heard stories—dreamers who can see threads of the future, fragments of what’s left of the world’s magic.

“What did you dream?” you ask.

The child stands, pointing toward the ruins behind them. “That you would help me find the place where the world starts again.”

And somehow, impossibly, you feel that ember inside you flare—small but undeniable.

You offer your hand.
“Then let’s go find it.”
