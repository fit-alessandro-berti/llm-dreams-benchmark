*In the dream...*

...find water. The dusty cobblestone streets stretch before me, lined with timber-framed houses whose thatched roofs sag with age. The air smells of wood smoke, horses, and something less pleasant I can't quite identify. My throat feels parched, and the sun beating down through my rough-woven clothes makes me desperate for a drink.

I stumble forward, my bare feet already sore against the uneven stones. People in long robes and simple tunics glance at me curiously - I must look strange to them, though I can't remember what I was wearing when I first arrived here. 

A woman carrying a clay jug catches my eye. She's heading toward what looks like a stone well in the village square. I follow her, mesmerized by the rhythmic creak of the wooden bucket as she lowers it into the dark depths. When she pulls it up, the water sparkles like liquid crystal.

But as I approach, reaching out desperately for just a sip, she looks right through me as if I'm not there. I try to speak, but no sound comes from my lips. The bucket wavers just beyond my grasp, and I realize with growing dread that I might not be as solid in this world as I thought...

*The dream shifts and wavers, as dreams do...*
