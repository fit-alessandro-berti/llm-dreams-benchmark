…feel the walls shift behind you, sealing off the paths you’ve already taken. The puzzles grow stranger, less about numbers or riddles and more about perception itself—shapes that rearrange when you blink, doors that only appear when you stop looking for them, patterns in the floor that hum faintly when your thoughts align in a certain way.  

Each solution feels less like something *you* figured out and more like something the maze pulled out of your mind and placed in front of you. The deeper you go, the more you sense that the maze is not just testing your intelligence—it’s mapping the way you think, reflecting it back at you like a hall of mirrors.  

At the center, though you cannot yet see it, something waits. You feel its pull every time you unlock another puzzle: a quiet, rhythmic pulse at the back of your mind, like a heartbeat beckoning you forward.  

Would you like me to continue the dream as a kind of *narrative journey* where you make choices about how you proceed, or would you like me to unfold it as a single surreal story without breaks?
