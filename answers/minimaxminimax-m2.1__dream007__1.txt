You decide to take a step back, literally and figuratively. You pause mid-sentence, your hand still raised emphatically, and notice the way your friend's eyes are flickering with exhaustion and hurt. The kitchen light above you both casts harsh shadows, making everything feel more dramatic than it probably is in the waking world.

"Can we just... start over?" you hear yourself say, your voice softer now. "I'm not trying to win this. I want to understand."

Your friend blinks, clearly surprised by the shift in tone. The tension in their shoulders eases just slightly, though their arms remain crossed defensively. "You started it by saying I was being irresponsible," they reply, but there's less heat in their words now.

You take a breath, recognizing that the argument has spiraled far from its original source. What started as a conversation about a life decision has become something else entirely—a collision of fears, past wounds, and unspoken concerns dressed up as logical arguments.

"You're right, I did. That was unfair." You pull out a chair and sit down, making the choice to stay rather than walk away angry. "I'm scared. I think that's what this is really about. I'm scared of losing you to something I don't understand, scared of watching you make choices I wouldn't make, scared that maybe I'm not as important to you as I thought I was."

The admission hangs in the air between you. It's vulnerability, and it's terrifying, but it feels more honest than anything you've said in the past hour.

Your friend slowly uncrosses their arms and sits down across from you. "I didn't know it was about that," they say quietly. "I thought you just didn't trust my judgment."

"I do trust your judgment," you reply. "I don't trust my own fear not to ruin things between us."

The dream shifts then, as dreams do—time compresses, emotions expand. You find yourself hugging your friend tightly, the argument already becoming a memory of how close you came to saying things you couldn't take back. The relief is so profound it almost wakes you.

But not quite. In the liminal space between sleeping and waking, you hear your friend whisper something that sounds like forgiveness, and you hold onto that feeling like a precious stone in your pocket, something you'll carry with you when you finally open your eyes.
