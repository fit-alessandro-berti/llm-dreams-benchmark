...decide to step back. Not out of surrender, but because the air between you has grown too thick—charged with hurt and history—and you suddenly realize that winning the argument means nothing if you lose them.

You take a breath, your voice softening like twilight spilling over sharp edges. "I don't want to fight you," you say, the words surprising even yourself. "I just... I need you to understand why this matters so much to me."

Your friend pauses, their eyes wide, fists uncurling slightly. The shouting fades into the hum of the city outside—distant traffic, a siren wailing like a ghost. You notice then that you’re standing in your childhood kitchen, the one with the chipped blue tiles and the window that never quite closed. Rain begins to patter against the glass, though it was sunny moments before. Dreams do that—shift beneath your feet like sand.

Your friend steps closer, their anger dissolving into something raw and tired. "I’m scared too," they admit, voice cracking. "I didn’t know how else to say it."

And just like that, the fight unravels into silence, into the space where real understanding begins. You reach for two mugs from the cabinet—the old ones with the faded sunflowers—and fill them with tea that steams with the warmth of forgiveness.

Outside, the rain turns to fireflies.
