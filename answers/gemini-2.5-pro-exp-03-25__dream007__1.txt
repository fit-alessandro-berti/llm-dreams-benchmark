Okay, the dream continues...

You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, maybe the last slice of shimmering dream-pizza, or the interpretation of the way the clouds formed faces yesterday, or perhaps the fundamental nature of gravity in this specific room. The air crackles with unspoken words and hurt feelings. Your friend's face seems to subtly ripple, like a reflection on water. The room itself feels unstable, the walls breathing slightly.

...and you decide to **stop talking and start singing.**

Not just any song, but the most ridiculously inappropriate song imaginable for the situation. Maybe it's an opera aria about lost socks, or a jaunty sea shanty about existential dread, or the theme tune to a children's cartoon you both used to watch, sung completely off-key.

You belt it out, pouring all the frustration and anger into the performance. Your friend stares, utterly dumbfounded. The intensity of the argument shatters, replaced by sheer absurdity. For a moment, they look like they might laugh, or maybe even join in.

Instead, they respond by interpretive dancing the *counter-argument*. They leap onto the coffee table (which is now unexpectedly made of Jell-O), striking dramatic poses that somehow perfectly encapsulate their point about the dream-pizza's rightful owner, their arms flailing to represent the injustice of your cloud interpretation, their legs wobbling precariously to demonstrate the flaws in your gravitational theory.

The argument hasn't ended, but it has transformed into a bizarre, avant-garde performance piece. The anger is still there, but it's now fuel for increasingly strange artistic expression. You switch to yodelling your rebuttal, and your friend begins sculpting their feelings out of the nearby bowl of floating fruit... The dream logic feels perfectly natural. Winning seems less important than simply keeping the performance going.
