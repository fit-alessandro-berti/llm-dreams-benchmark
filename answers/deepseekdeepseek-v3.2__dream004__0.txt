The canvas is not empty for long. As you step closer, the air around it shimmers, and the very colors of the world seem to drip from the leaves of a nearby floating tree, sliding through the air like liquid light. They pool at the base of the frame, then rise, defying gravity, to stain the pristine surface.

You don't paint with a brush. You paint with intention. A thought of a spiraling staircase manifests as a vortex of cerulean and gold. A feeling of nostalgia blushes the corner a soft, forgotten peach. You raise your hand, and a ribbon of emerald follows its arc, solidifying into a floating path.

But the canvas is a collaborator, not a slave. It breathes. The shapes you suggest mutate: the staircase blossoms into a trumpet flower, its bell echoing with silent music. The peach-colored memory deepens into a doorway, slightly ajar.

You realize this is not a painting of the dream. **This is the dream’s heart.** Each swirl is a thought you haven't finished thinking. Each stark, geometric shape that erupts suddenly is a fragment of a forgotten memory, sharp and undeniable.

You lean in, and your reflection appears not in the canvas, but *within* the landscape you've co-created. You are standing on the emerald path, looking back at yourself looking in. The you outside the canvas reaches out a finger to touch the scene, and the you inside the scene raises a hand in perfect unison.

Just as your fingertips are about to meet, glass to glass, dream to dream, the canvas shudders. It doesn't tear or crack. Instead, it *inhales*. With a silent rush, the entire vibrant world—the paths, the colors, the shapes, the duplicate you—streams off the canvas, rushing back into the swirling atmosphere of the dream.

It leaves behind not a blank canvas, but a mirror. And in it, your reflection winks, holding a single, ever-shifting color on its palm, before turning and walking away into the glass, inviting you to follow.
