...and you reach for your keyboard, but your fingers pass straight through the keys as if they are made of smoke. The office lights flicker and stretch into long, glowing ribbons that wrap around your wrists. 

Your boss is standing right in front of you, but their face is a blank, smooth mirror reflecting your own panicked expression back at you. They open their mouth to speak, but instead of words, a stream of colorful butterflies flies out, filling the room with a soft, humming vibration. The impossible deadline isn't written on a calendar; it's a giant, ticking clock floating in the center of the room, but the hands are spinning backward, unraveling the day into yesterday.

Suddenly, the floor beneath you turns into a deep, calm ocean. You aren't drowning, though; you're breathing water that tastes like static electricity. Your coworker swims by, dressed in a suit made of seaweed, and hands you a folder. Inside, there are no papers, just a single, glowing seed. 

"You just need to plant this," the seaweed-suited coworker whispers, their voice sounding like it's coming from underwater. "The project completes itself when the tree grows."

You look down at your hands, and vines are already sprouting from your fingertips, rapidly climbing up the walls of the office, bursting through the ceiling to reveal a sky filled with three moons. The pressure of the deadline dissolves into the scent of rain on hot asphalt. You realize you don't need to type a single word; you just need to watch the garden grow. 

Then, the sound of your alarm clock begins to mimic the ticking of the floating clock, blending the dream world with the waking one, pulling you gently toward the edge of consciousness.
