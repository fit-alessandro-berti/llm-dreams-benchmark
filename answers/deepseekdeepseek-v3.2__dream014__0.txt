...feel a knot of tension in your chest begin to loosen. One of them, a woman with a smile that reaches her eyes, offers you a warm pastry from a paper bag. The scent of butter and sugar cuts through the city smells. As you eat, they don't ask for your destination right away. Instead, they simply walk with you, their presence a quiet buffer against the chaos.

They point out hidden things—a cat napping in a florist’s window, a mural painted on a side alley you would have missed, the best spot to hear the distant music from a street performer. You start to tell them you’re trying to find the river, but the words seem less urgent now.

Then, you turn a corner, and there it is. Not just the river, but a specific, small bridge you’d been searching for all along, the one from a faded childhood photo. The strangers stop. "Here is your way," the woman says. But when you turn to thank them, the bustling crowd has swallowed them up. You are alone again, but the feeling of being lost is gone. In your hand is the empty paper bag, and the taste of kindness, sweet and real, lingers on your tongue.
