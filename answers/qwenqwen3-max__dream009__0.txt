...survive. The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth, not exhaust or plastic. Rough-spun wool scratches your skin—clothes you don’t remember putting on. Around you, timber-framed houses with thatched roofs huddle along a muddy lane. Chickens scatter as you step into the street, and a blacksmith’s hammer rings in the distance.

Your stomach growls. You need food, shelter, and answers—but this isn’t a history book. People here won’t care about your "time travel theory." They’ll care if you can work, if you’re trustworthy, or if you’re a thief.
