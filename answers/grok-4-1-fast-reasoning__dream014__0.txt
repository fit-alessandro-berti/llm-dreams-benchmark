You gratefully accept their offer, your heart lifting with unexpected relief. The strangers— a lively mix of artists, musicians, and wanderers—link arms with you, their laughter echoing off the neon-lit skyscrapers. Together, you weave through the chaotic streets, past street performers juggling fire and vendors hawking glowing trinkets that whisper secrets.

As the night deepens, the city pulses like a living heartbeat. Your new friends lead you to a hidden rooftop garden blooming impossibly atop a towering spire. Stars swirl overhead in impossible patterns, and a feast appears from thin air: fruits that taste like forgotten memories, wine that sparkles with fireflies.

But in the dream's twist, you realize they're not strangers at all—they're echoes of people you've lost touch with, faces from your past smiling anew. You dance under the aurora until dawn breaks, the city dissolving into golden mist. You wake with a smile, no longer lost, carrying the warmth of that impossible kindness into the day.
