You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and...  

The room pulses with laughter and clinking glasses, but the faces blur into a sea of strangers. You weave through clusters of people, each group a different world. First, a group of people in mirrored costumes, their faces reflecting your own as they recite your deepest fears in unison. You stumble away, heart racing, as their voices echo, *“You’ll never belong here.”*  

Next, a circle of children playing a game with oversized dice, their laughter sharp and echoing. They invite you to join, but when you reach for the dice, they melt into sand, slipping through your fingers. A shadowy figure watches from the edge of the group, their face familiar—*the one person you’re looking for*. You call out, but the sound gets swallowed by the crowd.  

You drift into a quiet corner where a group of people sit in silence, their eyes closed, hands clasped. A soft hum vibrates in the air, and for a moment, you feel peace. But when you open your eyes, the group has vanished, leaving only a single white rose on the table. You pick it up, and it transforms into a key.  

The key fits a door you didn’t notice before, hidden behind a tapestry of constellations. Beyond it, a hallway stretches infinitely, each door labeled with memories: *your first kiss, your mother’s voice, the day you lost your way*. You push through the final door, and there they are—the one person you know, standing in a field of glowing fireflies.  

But as you run to them, the fireflies swirl into a storm, and the ground crumbles. You wake up, gasping, in a room that’s both familiar and strange, the scent of lavender lingering in the air. The dream fades, but the key remains in your hand, warm and real.  

Or maybe… you’re still dreaming.
