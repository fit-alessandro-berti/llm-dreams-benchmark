You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to follow the faint glow of a mysterious light in the distance, a beacon that seems to pulse like a heartbeat. The air is thick with ash, and the ruins of skyscrapers loom like skeletal fingers against the horizon. Your boots crunch over shattered glass as you trek through the wasteland, driven by a mix of desperation and curiosity.  

As you approach the light, you stumble upon a hidden greenhouse, its glass walls cracked but still intact, sheltering a lush garden of vibrant flora. A figure stands within—a scientist, their face gaunt but eyes alight with determination. They explain that this is a last refuge, a sanctuary where they’ve cultivated seeds from the old world, nurturing hope for a rebirth. But the garden is under threat: a toxic storm is approaching, and the group needs to decide whether to flee or risk everything to preserve their work.  

You hesitate, torn between self-preservation and the weight of legacy. Then, you recall a memory of your own garden back home, a place of solace. You step forward, offering to help guard the greenhouse, knowing that survival isn’t just about enduring—it’s about choosing what to protect. As the storm rages outside, you and the scientist work in tandem, sealing the greenhouse and planting seeds in the soil, each one a promise that life, however fragile, can still take root.  

In the dream, you wake with a strange certainty: the world may be broken, but so are the seeds of its renewal. And somewhere, in the cracks of the earth, a new beginning is already growing.
