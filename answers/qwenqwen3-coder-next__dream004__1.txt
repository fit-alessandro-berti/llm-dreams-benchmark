…a brush resting on the edge of the canvas—its bristles shimmering like liquid mercury, shifting from silver to violet to gold with every breath of air. The canvas isn’t white, though—it’s a deep, velvety *absence*, a silence so profound it hums at the edge of hearing.

As you lift the brush, the air thickens with anticipation. Not paint comes to mind—but *memory*. Each stroke would be an echo of something lost, something half-forgotten.

You dip the brush—not into paint, but into the *space between* two shifting mountains: one of crimson fractals, the other of liquid sapphire. The brush emerges carrying a droplet that doesn’t fall—it *hovers*, pulsing like a heartbeat.

You touch the canvas.

Instantly, the droplet blooms outward—not as color, but as *time*. Lines bloom like roots, branching into vines of mint-green equations. Triangles melt into hourglasses, spilling sand that glows amber and coalesces into birds mid-flight. A circle expands, becoming the pupil of an eye that blinks—and in its iris, you see *your own face*, younger, older, smiling faintly.

The canvas isn’t being painted *on*—it’s remembering *you*.

Then, from the corner of your eye, something flickers: another brush, identical, waiting beside it. And beside *that*—a second canvas. And beyond it… a third. An endless cascade of canvases, each waiting for its own remembered moment.

A whisper, not in your ears but in your bones:  
*“Which memory will you give voice to first?”*

And as the wind shifts, carrying whispers in a hundred forgotten tongues, the ground beneath you begins to ripple—not like water, but like a thought dissolving into a dream… and you realize:  
You aren’t painting *on* the canvas.  
You’re painting *yourself back into being*.

What do you choose to paint first?
