â€”feel your heart race as the weight of the task settles onto your shoulders. You glance at the clock â€” the hands seem to spin faster, mocking you. Your desk is suddenly cluttered with papers, blueprints, and tangled cords you don't recognize.  

Your boss stands there, arms crossed, expectant but strangely blurry, as if you're looking at him through a fogged-up window. He says something, but the words come out muffled, like you're underwater.  

You reach for a pen, but instead, your hand pulls out a long, wiggling vine from the drawer. The vine wraps around your wrist, pulling you closer to the desk. Panic flickers in your chest â€” but somehow, deep down, you realize this is normal here.  

You take a deep breath and try to focus. Maybe if you start organizing the chaos, you can beat the impossible. You lift a piece of paper and it transforms into a glowing map, leading somewhere off the edge of your desk, into what looks like a thick, misty forest.  

Without really thinking, you step onto the desk â€” and it bends like a diving board â€” and leap into the unknown.  

Would you like me to keep going? ðŸŒ™
