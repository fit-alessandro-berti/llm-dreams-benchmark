You start to wander the labyrinthine streets, the city's spires twisting like fingers reaching for a bruised sky. Neon signs flicker in languages you half-remember from forgotten childhood books, and the air hums with the chatter of birds that sound suspiciously like dial-up modems. Panic bubbles up, but so does a strange curiosity—you pull out your phone, only to find its screen displaying a map that's alive, rivers of ink flowing backward, buildings folding into origami cranes that take flight.

Desperate, you flag down a passing taxi, its driver a shadowy figure with eyes like polished obsidian. "The meeting?" you stammer. He grins, teeth gleaming like shattered glass. "Ah, yes. It's at the corner of Echo and Neverwas. But first, you must solve the riddle of the whispering clock." The cab lurches forward, weaving through crowds of people who pause mid-step, frozen in laughter or tears, as if the world is a paused film reel.

Time slips—your watch melts into your wrist, the hourglass sands turning to stardust. You arrive at a towering glass edifice that wasn't there a moment ago, its doors guarded by a flock of mechanical butterflies. Inside, the meeting room is a vast chamber of mirrors, reflecting infinite versions of yourself: one confident, one terrified, one sipping tea with a dragon. The attendees are there—faceless executives with voices like thunder—but as you sit, the table dissolves into a sea of glowing code, and you realize the "important meeting" is with your own subconscious, debating the merits of waking up.

Suddenly, the mirrors crack, and the city folds inward like a dream origami. You jolt awake, heart racing, the echo of that riddle lingering: "What has no hands but holds time?" The alarm clock. It's 7:00 AM. Just a dream... or was it?
