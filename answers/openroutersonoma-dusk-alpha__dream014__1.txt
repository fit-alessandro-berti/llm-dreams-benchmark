You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you hesitate at first, your heart pounding with a mix of suspicion and longing. But their warm smiles and gentle insistence melt your doubts, and you nod gratefully, joining them as they lead you through the neon-lit streets toward a hidden café glowing like a beacon.

Inside, the air smells of fresh coffee and cinnamon, and the strangers reveal themselves as fellow wanderers—artists, travelers, and dreamers—who've formed an unspoken pact to guide the lost. They share stories of their own detours, laughing over maps drawn on napkins, and as the night deepens, you realize this isn't just about directions anymore. The city transforms around you, buildings twisting into playful mazes that whisper secrets, and you awaken not with relief, but with a spark of belonging, ready to explore the waking world with new eyes.
