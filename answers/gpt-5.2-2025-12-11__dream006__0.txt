…speak—but your voice comes out as a low hum, like a tuning fork someone forgot to strike. You clear your throat and try again. The microphone pops, then dissolves into a handful of dandelion fluff that floats up past your face and into the stage lights.

The lights are too bright to look at directly. They buzz like insects. Somewhere in the dark beyond them, the audience shifts as one body, a single quiet inhale.

You glance down at your notes. The paper is blank except for a sentence written in your own handwriting, though you don’t remember writing it:

**“Tell them what you couldn’t say.”**

A ripple of nervous laughter runs through the crowd—except no one’s mouth is moving. The sound seems to come from the seats themselves, from the fabric and the wood, as if the room has learned how to mimic people.

Behind you, a stagehand you’ve never met places a glass of water on the podium. You reach for it. The water trembles, then settles, then shows—not your reflection, but a small view of somewhere else: a kitchen at night, a clock blinking 12:00, someone you can’t quite see standing at the sink with their back turned.

You look up sharply, and the audience has changed. They’re still a large crowd, but now every face is familiar in a way that makes your chest tighten: teachers, strangers from old buses, a childhood friend you lost track of, the cashier who once asked how your day was and waited for an answer, the person you were angry at in a dream years ago. All of them watching you with the kind of patience that is also a demand.

Your tongue feels too big for your mouth. Your hands don’t know what to do.

So you do the only thing that seems possible: you start telling the truth in fragments.

“I didn’t know,” you say, and your voice finally carries—warm, clear, amplified without a microphone. “I didn’t know how to… be in it. I didn’t know how to ask for what I needed without apologizing for needing it.”

The stage floor shifts under your feet, gently at first. The wood grain becomes a map—rivers, roads, a coastline—and the podium becomes a lectern made of stone, as if you’re delivering this speech from the top of a cliff. Far below, the ocean is moving in slow, deliberate breaths.

The audience leans in. Their eyes shine like wet pebbles.

You flip the blank page. Another line appears:

**“Name it, and it won’t chase you.”**

You swallow. Your heart bangs in your ribs like someone knocking from the inside.

“I’ve been afraid,” you admit. The word drops into the room and lands with a soft, physical thud. It rolls down the aisle between the seats like a small, dark marble. No one flinches. No one laughs. They just watch it settle.

You feel the fear loosen, not disappear, but change—like a knot being worked open by careful fingers.

The buzzing lights above you dim. The room becomes less of a room and more of a place that could hold whatever comes next.

Somewhere, a child in the front row raises a hand. You can’t tell if it’s a child you once were or a child you might know someday. Their sleeve is too long, their fingers ink-stained.

“Yes?” you ask.

The child’s voice is your voice, smaller. “What are you going to do now?”

Your prepared speech—whatever it was supposed to be—drifts away like the dandelion fluff, and you realize you never needed it. The audience is waiting, not for performance, but for a direction.

You look back at the glass of water. The kitchen scene is still there, but the figure at the sink turns slightly, as if listening. You can’t see their face. You don’t need to.

You lean forward, hands on the stone lectern, and you choose your next words carefully, like stepping-stones across a river.

“I’m going to stop pretending I’m fine when I’m not,” you say. “I’m going to stop calling it ‘nothing’ when it’s something. I’m going to call the people I miss. I’m going to forgive what I can. I’m going to try again at what I stopped halfway. I’m going to—”

The ocean below you surges, and a wave rises, impossibly high, but it doesn’t crash. It pauses, suspended, glittering with all the stage lights you thought were insects, and in it you see tiny scenes: doors you didn’t open, letters you didn’t send, mornings you slept through, laughter you forgot you had.

The crowd stands—not all at once, but like a field of grass lifting in the wind. No applause. Just attention. Just recognition.

A warm pressure fills your chest, as if someone has placed a hand there from the inside, steadying you.

You look down at your final page. It is no longer blank. It is covered, edge to edge, in a handwriting that is yours but older, calmer.

At the bottom is the last line:

**“Wake up carrying this.”**

The wave begins to fall. The cliff trembles. The room exhales.

You open your mouth to finish—but the entire scene slides sideways, like a curtain being drawn, and you are suddenly backstage, in a narrow corridor lined with mirrors.

In every mirror, you’re still onstage, still speaking, but the words are silent. Only one reflection meets your eyes and nods, as if to say: *Yes. That’s the one.*

A door at the end of the corridor is cracked open. Bright morning light spills through, smelling faintly of coffee and rain.

You walk toward it, and with each step your clothes change: formal shoes to sneakers, blazer to a soft shirt, pockets filling with small, ordinary things—keys, a folded note, a tiny smooth stone.

Just before you reach the door, you hear the audience one last time—not a roar, not applause, but a single sentence spoken in many voices at once, gentle and firm:

“Don’t forget.”

You put your hand on the knob.

It turns easily.

And as the light pours over you, the dream breaks like a thin shell, and you wake with the strange certainty that you’ve already begun the speech.
