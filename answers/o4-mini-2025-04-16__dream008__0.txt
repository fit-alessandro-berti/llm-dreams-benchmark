…glance at the clock. Its hands are spinning backward, forward, then melting over the polished wood of your desk. Your boss’s eyes glow faintly in the corner of the office, and the fluorescent lights hum a dissonant lullaby.

You sit, heart pounding, and open your laptop. The screen fills with code, charts, slides — every file you’ve never seen before. You’re supposed to turn them into a perfect presentation by tomorrow morning. Impossible. Panic creeps up your throat. You try to call for help, but your mouth has turned to jelly. So you begin typing anyway.

As your fingers press the keys, the letters lift off the screen and spiral around you like fireflies. Each word you write coalesces into floating panels of neat bullet‐points, graphs that draw themselves, images that align perfectly on invisible grids. Your boss steps closer, but instead of frowning, he smiles—and you realize his face is one you haven’t seen since childhood: your first teacher, encouraging you.

A gentle breeze drifts through the window; papers flutter into place. You watch, amazed, as the impossible deadline rewinds: the due date moves forward to next month. The project blossoms effortlessly under your touch. When you finally stop, the office is silent. The glowing report hovers in front of you, complete.

Your boss reaches out, takes the floating document, and nods approvingly. The lights brighten to a soft morning glow. You exhale—and wake up in your own bed, heart still racing. On your nightstand, half‑dreaming, you see a single sheet of paper: a perfect summary of everything you “accomplished.” The timestamp reads tomorrow at 9 AM. You smile, and wonder: was it all a dream … or a secret plan?
