begin to speak, but the words tangle on your tongue like forgotten shoelaces, slipping out in fragments of half-remembered poetry. "The universe," you declare, your voice echoing off invisible walls, "is a vast library where every book is written in the ink of stars, and we're all just overdue fines waiting to be collected."

The audience leans forward, a sea of faces shimmering like oil on water—friends from childhood morphing into strangers with eyes like distant galaxies, their applause a rustle of autumn leaves. You gesture grandly, and suddenly the podium sprouts wings, feathers of iridescent code and cosmic dust, lifting you into the air. Below, the crowd dissolves into a flock of paper cranes, each one unfolding to reveal maps of uncharted dreams.

As you soar higher, the speech unravels into song, a melody woven from the hum of quantum strings and the whisper of black hole winds. "Listen," you sing to the dissolving horizon, "for in the silence between heartbeats, the multiverse applauds." And just as the stage tilts into infinity, you wake with the echo of laughter on your lips, the curtains of sleep drawing back to reveal your own quiet room, alive with possibility. What a dream to carry into the day.
