You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the sky darkens as thick clouds roll in overhead. The gentle rustling of leaves turns into a roaring wind, swirling around you with an electric charge. Raindrops begin to fall, at first lightly, then heavier, drumming on the canopy above and soaking the earth beneath your feet.

As you hurry to find shelter, you notice a faint glow through the trees. Drawn to it, you stumble upon a small clearing where a circle of ancient, towering oaks surrounds a shimmering pool of water. The storm rages around you, but inside the circle, there is an almost magical calm. The water’s surface reflects the stormy sky, but as you gaze into it, images begin to ripple and change—visions of places and moments both familiar and strange.

You realize this dream is an invitation to explore deeper parts of yourself hidden beneath the storm’s surface. The storm outside echoes the turmoil within, but the serene pool offers a space of clarity and insight. With a sense of wonder, you sit by the water’s edge, ready to dive into the mysteries that await beneath its shimmering depths.
