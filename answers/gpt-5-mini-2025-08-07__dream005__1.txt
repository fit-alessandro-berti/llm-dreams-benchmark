…they all answer as if your voice were a bell and each chime calls a different thing.

The chandelier overhead is less a light than a constellation; the guests are planets on veranda paths. You drift from one microcosm to the next. A cluster of people trade shoes and walk away on new strides, laughing at the way the world tilts when you steal someone else’s step. A pair sits at a tiny table playing chess with teacups; every capture spills a memory into a saucer that evaporates before you can sip. Someone offers you a paper map folded into a crane; it unfolds to show only the word left, or sometimes nothing at all.

In one corner a choir hums without opening mouths; the notes shape themselves around your name and then forget it, turning into birds that flutter into a hanging garden. At the bar, a woman with a clock stitched to her sleeve tells you the time is exactly what you need it to be, which is either too early or too late depending on which way you tilt the glass. A group of teenagers paint portraits of empty chairs and sell them for generous prices; the canvases look like rooms you used to know.

You keep asking, "Have you seen them?" and each answer is a detour. "Behind the library," someone sighs, and you find a ladder of books climbing into a sky of headlines. "On the rooftop," another says; you ascend and the roof is a city of paper boats sailing across an indoor ocean. The directions are never wrong, only not entirely true. People point with palms full of small objects—a key that opens nothing, a photograph that changes faces as you blink.

Every new group offers you a piece of yourself in exchange for your patience. A child hands you a drawer full of names and asks which one you recognize; the names make a sound like rain. A man in a bright scarf who speaks in riddles presses a small mirror into your hand; your reflection is there but wearing someone else’s smile. You feel lighter and stranger at once, as if the search is fraying the edges of you and leaving threads on chairs and shoulders.

At last you step into a quieter room that seems to have been designed for just two people and a long conversation. Someone is there already, seated beneath a single lamp that hums like a settled insect. You know this person the way you know a melody you can’t place—every feature is familiar but rearranged: the slope of a jaw as a map you have walked, the way they hold a cup like a habit. For a moment you think perhaps you were wrong and that the whole party was an elaborate jest of acquaintances.

They look up and smile without surprise. "I was wondering when you'd stop asking strangers," they say, as if it's the most reasonable observation in the world. "You kept picking up everyone else's stories. I left a few open for you." Their hand, when they reach across the table, fits into yours in a way that removes half the room from your shoulders. Outside the door the party muffles to a distant tide of laughter and the clink of glasses.

You sit. They pour two cups of something that smells like home and thunder, and the light steadies into a single window. There is no sharp explanation; there never is in dreams. Instead there is the gentle settling of where you are supposed to be. The crowd beyond the door becomes a story you can tell later—if later exists—and in this small, improbable room the one person you came for crosses their legs and begins to tell you the very thing you were trying to find: how they had been looking for you, too.
