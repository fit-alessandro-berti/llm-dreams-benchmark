panic, your heart racing as you glance around at the towering skyscrapers and bustling streets filled with people who seem to know exactly where they’re going. You pat your pockets, hoping to find a phone or a map, but they’re empty except for a crumpled piece of paper. You unfold it, and to your relief, there’s an address scribbled in messy handwriting, though the street name is smudged. It reads: “47 ____ Avenue, 14th Floor.” 

You look up, trying to get your bearings, but the city feels like a maze, with neon signs flashing in languages you don’t recognize and the hum of traffic drowning out your thoughts. You decide to ask for help and approach a street vendor selling steaming bowls of something fragrant. The vendor, an older woman with a kind, weathered face, looks at you with curious eyes. You show her the paper and ask if she knows where “47 ____ Avenue” is. She squints at the smudged writing, then points down a narrow alleyway to your left. “Keep going straight, past the red lantern shop, then turn right at the fountain with the broken angel statue. You’ll see it. But hurry—time slips away faster here.”

Her cryptic warning sends a chill down your spine, but you thank her and head into the alley. The city seems to shift as you walk; the buildings lean closer together, and the sounds of the main street fade into an eerie quiet. You pass the red lantern shop, its glowing orbs casting flickering shadows on the cobblestones, and soon spot the fountain she mentioned. The broken angel statue looms over it, one wing shattered, its stone face eerily lifelike as if watching you. You turn right as instructed, and the street opens into a wide boulevard lined with glass towers that reflect a sky swirling with unnatural colors—deep purples and greens, like a storm about to break.

Finally, you see a building with a gleaming sign: “47 Zenith Avenue.” This must be it. You check an old pocket watch that suddenly appears in your hand—only 10 minutes until the meeting. You rush inside, the lobby a cavernous space of marble and mirrored walls that make you feel like you’re walking through a kaleidoscope. An elevator dings, and you step inside, pressing the button for the 14th floor. As the doors close, you notice the numbers on the panel don’t stop at 14—they go up to 99, and there’s a strange symbol etched next to the highest number, almost like a warning.

The elevator hums as it ascends, but it feels like it’s moving too slowly, or maybe not at all. You glance at the watch again, and the hands are spinning backward. A voice crackles through a hidden speaker, soft and distorted: “You’re almost there… but are you sure you want to be?” Your stomach drops as the elevator lurches, and the lights flicker. When the doors finally open on the 14th floor, you step out into a hallway that stretches endlessly in both directions, lined with identical black doors, each with a brass number plate. The air is heavy, and you hear a faint whisper, though you can’t make out the words.

You realize you don’t know which room the meeting is in, and the piece of paper in your pocket is now blank. The hallway seems to pulse, the walls rippling like water, and you feel the weight of a decision pressing down on you. Do you start knocking on doors, hoping to find the right one, or do you turn back, unsure if the elevator will even take you where you came from? As you stand there, the whispers grow louder, and you swear one of the doors at the far end of the hall just creaked open on its own…
