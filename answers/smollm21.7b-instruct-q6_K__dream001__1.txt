run about the city searching for your appointment, which seems impossible due to its gigantic size. Every building looks similar and none of them seem like they might be related to the purpose of your meeting. As time passes by, you grow more anxious, thinking that everyone in this city must also know about your important meeting but keep it a secret from you. You then remember you had asked for directions, specifically asking at a street corner before starting your journey in order to get some help and find it quickly. You turn back toward the edge of the crowded sidewalk to ask someone where your meeting place is located. 

However, as you approach again, people are not around; there might be more buildings nearby that could house a building with such an important purpose and you decide to look through them one by one but every door seems empty except for a few who have businesses outside the city (which you're still dreaming out of). Before giving up in exhaustion from your failed attempt, you hear laughter coming from behind one of these buildings. The sound calms your panic as it suggests human presence.

You turn towards the laughing sound hoping there might be someone helpful around. You push open a door slightly ajar and step inside to see what's going on - only one individual stands at the counter: she looks young but knows exactly where her meeting is located; you thank her profusely for stopping by, knowing how hard or long it must have taken her given your predicament. She hands over some information including addresses which look plausible enough so that you can navigate through this unfamiliar city. 

You leave thanking the stranger again; she seems pleased as well when realizing she has managed to assist a stranger in such an odd way - not even knowing what her own work involves anymore. With much gratitude and determination, you finally find your meeting place thanks to her kindness despite them seemingly living on opposite sides of Earth right now.
