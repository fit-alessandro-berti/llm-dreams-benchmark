The storm roared with a fury that seemed to swallow the ship whole. Waves taller than the mast crashed over the deck, drenching the crew in icy saltwater. The *Sea Venture* groaned under the strain, timbers creaking like the bones of a dying beast. Your first mate, Elara, gripped the rail, her voice barely audible over the gale. *"Captain! The starboard side’s taking on water—should we jettison the cargo?"*  

You hesitated. That cargo held the village’s last stores of grain, their only hope against the coming winter. But the ship’s integrity was crumbling. *Think*, you told yourself. *The crew comes first.*  

A thunderclap split the sky, and lightning illuminated a jagged reef looming ahead—a hazard no chart had ever marked. The wheel shuddered in your grip as the ship heeled sharply. Suddenly, through the rain, a faint glow pierced the darkness: a lighthouse beam, slicing the chaos like a silver blade. It pulsed rhythmically, guiding you toward a hidden cove.  

"Hard to port! Follow the light!" you barked. The crew scrambled, their movements a chaotic ballet of desperation and trust. As the lighthouse beam steadied, the waves seemed to part, revealing a narrow channel between the rocks.  

Then, as if by magic, the storm stilled. The wind fell silent, and the sea flattened into a mirror. In the sudden calm, you saw it: a figure standing on the lighthouse cliff, its face obscured by a hood, but its hand raised in a gesture of silent approval.  

The crew erupted into exhausted cheers as the *Sea Venture* glided into the cove. Anchored safely, you leaned against the rail, heart pounding. The dream dissolved as dawn’s first light broke over the water—and you woke, the taste of salt still on your lips, the weight of the wheel in your hands.  

What did the lighthouse symbolize? A choice you must make in waking life? Or a warning of unseen dangers ahead? The dream left no answers, only the echo of your own voice, commanding the storm.
