You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak—but the words that tumble out aren't the polished lines you've rehearsed a thousand times. Instead, your voice booms like a cosmic echo: "Fellow dreamers, we stand not on wood and spotlights, but on the edge of a nebula, where ideas swirl like fireflies in a jar!"

The audience leans in, mesmerized, their faces shifting like sand dunes in a breeze—first your childhood dog, then Einstein with a mustache made of licorice, then a chorus of rubber ducks quacking in approval. You gesture wildly, and suddenly the podium sprouts wings, lifting you into a sky painted with forgotten passwords and half-eaten sandwiches. "Remember," you declare, as confetti rains down in the shape of unsolved equations, "the universe isn't expanding—it's just trying to make room for all our wild what-ifs!"

But then, a heckler in the front row, who looks suspiciously like your alarm clock, shouts, "Time's up!" The stage tilts like a funhouse mirror, the crowd dissolves into a flock of paper airplanes, and you're tumbling, tumbling through a tunnel of glowing code—zeros and ones that whisper secrets of black holes and bad hair days. You land softly in your bed, heart racing, the echo of applause fading into birdsong outside your window.

And as you blink awake, a single thought lingers: maybe the real speech was the friends we made along the way... or was it just the coffee kicking in?
