...each group seems to be speaking in perfect unison, their voices blending into a low hum that vibrates in your chest. You catch fragments—laughter like wind chimes, a debate about the color of time, someone insisting clocks are just scared calendars. You weave through them, heart syncing with the cadence, until you spot her: your friend Lila, back turned, wearing the blue scarf you gifted her last winter.  

You reach for her shoulder, but she turns—and it’s not Lila. A stranger with kind eyes, holding a tray of glasses filled with shimmering liquid. "Looking for someone?" they ask, though their lips don’t move. The hum softens.  

One glass drifts toward you.  

Do you take it? Or turn back toward the door you don’t remember entering?
