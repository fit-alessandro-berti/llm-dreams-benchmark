…you start to notice that the rules keep changing in small, almost polite ways.

At first it’s normal enough: a bright convention hall, rows of desks, a giant screen with a countdown clock, and a host with a headset mic who keeps saying your name like they’ve known you for years. The competitors around you are all different ages, dressed for different industries—lab coats beside suits beside hoodies—and yet everyone wears the same paper wristband stamped with a title: **APPLICANT**.

The first challenge is a written test. The questions look familiar, but the ink swims when you blink. You answer anyway, because your hand seems to know what to do even when your mind hesitates. When time is called, the host collects your pages and holds them up to the lights as if checking for watermarks.

“You did great,” they say, smiling too widely. “Now we’ll just need your *references*.”

A door appears where there wasn’t one a second ago. On it is a brass plaque that reads: **PEOPLE WHO CAN VOUCH FOR YOU**.

You push it open and step into a narrow hallway lined with framed photographs. At first, the faces are comforting—teachers, friends, past coworkers. But as you walk, the frames begin to show moments you don’t remember living: you accepting awards you never applied for, shaking hands with strangers who look like they’re congratulating you for something you didn’t do. In the glass, your reflection is a little delayed, like it has to think before copying you.

At the end of the hall sits a receptionist behind a desk made of stacked résumé paper.

“Name?” they ask without looking up.

You tell them.

They flip through a file and frown. “We’re missing a letter from the person who knows you best.”

“I don’t—” you begin, because you’re not sure who that is, and the hallway’s air has thickened into something that smells like printer toner and rain.

The receptionist slides a blank sheet toward you. “You can write it yourself,” they say, as if this is a kindness. “Just sign it with their name.”

The pen is heavy. The paper is too clean. You can feel all the ways this could go wrong. You try anyway, writing a few lines about your work ethic, your creativity, your reliability. Halfway through, the handwriting shifts. It becomes neater, more confident, like someone else is guiding your fingers. You glance up—

—and the receptionist is gone.

Behind the desk is a mirror instead. Not a normal mirror: the kind you see in old department stores that makes you look slightly taller, slightly slimmer, slightly more hireable. Your reflection meets your eyes and smiles with the exact expression the host had.

“Better,” it says, though you can’t hear it with your ears. The words arrive in your head like an email notification. “Now you’re ready for the next round.”

The convention hall is back, but rearranged. The desks are gone. The competitors are gone too, replaced by mannequins wearing their clothes. A gentle applause track plays from somewhere in the ceiling. The host stands beside a new door, this one marked:

**PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION**

Inside is not a room but a city street at dusk. The kind of dusk that makes everything feel like it’s on the edge of becoming a story. Streetlights blink awake. Somewhere, a siren rises and falls like a sigh. You’re handed a lanyard with a badge that reads your name and, beneath it, the title of your dream job.

For a moment, your chest fills with something bright. You did it. You made it.

Then you look closer at the badge.

The title is accurate, yes—but the font is wrong. The letters twitch slightly, as if they’re alive. And under the title is a second line, small enough that you almost miss it:

**TEMPORARY**

A voice speaks from your earpiece, though you don’t remember putting one on.

“Welcome to your role,” it says. “This simulation will assess your ability to perform under realistic conditions.”

“What are the conditions?” you ask, and your voice sounds too loud in the street, like you’re speaking in a library.

“Ambiguity,” the voice says pleasantly. “Contradiction. Public scrutiny. And the need to be excellent while not being seen trying.”

A person approaches you on the sidewalk. They look ordinary—coffee cup, tired eyes, jacket half-zipped. Then they hold out their phone and turn the screen toward you.

On the screen is a message thread. Your name is at the top. The last message, supposedly from you, reads: **I can’t do this anymore.**

“I got this from you,” the stranger says. “Is it true?”

You open your mouth. No sound comes out at first. Then, finally: “No.”

The stranger watches you like a judge.

“Prove it,” they say.

More people appear. They step out of doorways, out from behind parked cars, from the gaps between sentences. Each one holds something: an email, a performance review, a complaint, a compliment that feels like a trap. They circle you at a polite distance, the way people circle a street performer, except you are not performing on purpose.

Your earpiece crackles. “Remember,” the voice says, “the dream job goes to the person who can handle *anything*.”

You try to answer the first person carefully, and the second person honestly, and the third person with humor. You move through the crowd like you’re solving a puzzle with no picture on the box. Every time you think you’ve found the pattern, it changes.

Then you notice something: the questions aren’t really about your skills.

They’re about your *story*.

Who you are when you fail. Who you are when you succeed. Whether you belong in the room. Whether you’re grateful enough. Whether you want it too much. Whether you want it not enough.

You start to get tired in that particular dream way—like your bones are filled with wet sand. The streetlights buzz overhead. Your badge grows heavier on your chest. The crowd keeps asking, and you keep answering, and the voice in your ear keeps saying your time is almost up, almost up, almost—

A hand touches your shoulder.

It’s the host, suddenly beside you as if they’ve always been there. Their smile is softer now, almost real.

“You’re doing well,” they say.

“I don’t know what you want,” you whisper.

The host tilts their head. “We want to see if you’ll trade yourself for the job.”

They gesture to a storefront window. In the glass, you see yourself again, but this version is already dressed for success: confident posture, calm eyes, the kind of face that looks like it belongs on a company website. Your reflection is speaking to the crowd with perfect composure. They nod, they smile, they step back, letting it pass. The street seems to open for it like water.

“I can be that,” your reflection mouths, and you understand it without sound. “Just let me drive.”

Your throat tightens. You can feel how easy it would be to step aside—to let the polished version of you take over. The job, the title, the relief. The end of proving.

The host leans closer. “All you have to do,” they say, “is agree that this is who you are now.”

Your reflection lifts its hand and presses its palm to the glass from the inside.

You lift your own hand.

The glass is cold, and for a second your palms align perfectly. The street noise fades. The world narrows to the thin, shimmering boundary between you and the person you could become.

In the quiet, another sound emerges: not applause, not a countdown, not the voice in your ear.

A heartbeat.

Your heartbeat, slow and stubborn, like a metronome refusing to speed up.

You look at your reflection and you realize something else: it isn’t lying. It really could do the job. It could do it beautifully. It could do it without shaking.

But it isn’t you.

Or rather—it is you, edited down to what other people can easily consume.

Behind you, the crowd murmurs, impatient now. The host waits. Your reflection keeps its palm against yours like a seal, like a contract.

You lower your hand.

The host’s smile falters for the first time.

“I want the job,” you say, your voice steadier than you expected, “but I’m not signing away the parts of me that made me want it.”

The street goes oddly still, as if the city itself is listening.

The host studies you. The earpiece is silent. Even the mannequins in the convention hall—because you suddenly know they’re there, just out of sight—seem to hold their breath.

Then the host sighs, a real human sound.

“Okay,” they say. “Final challenge.”

A door appears in the middle of the sidewalk. No frame, no wall. Just a door standing upright like a decision.

The plaque reads:

**THE INTERVIEW WITH YOURSELF**

You turn the knob and step through.

Inside is a small room lit like early morning. A table. Two chairs. A cup of water sweating gently onto a coaster. On the far wall is a window that looks out onto nothing but soft white cloud.

In the chair across from you sits…you. Not the polished reflection. Not the version who could glide through a crowd. Just you, as you are right now: tired, hopeful, a little rumpled at the edges, eyes that have seen enough to know what you’re afraid of.

They slide a folder toward you. It’s labeled with your name.

“Tell me,” the other you says, “what you think you’re actually trying to win.”

You open the folder. Inside are not certificates or awards, but small, ordinary things: a scribbled note you once wrote to yourself and forgot, a photo of a day you didn’t realize mattered, a receipt from a coffee you bought when you were at your lowest and still went to work anyway. There’s a blank page at the back.

Your throat burns.

“The job,” you say automatically.

The other you waits, patient.

You look again. You see it: what’s underneath the job, the reason it glows in your mind like a lighthouse.

“To be…safe,” you admit. “To be proud. To stop feeling like I’m improvising my life.”

The other you nods. “And if the job doesn’t give you that?”

The question lands with a softness that still knocks the wind out of you. You stare at the blank page.

Outside the window, the clouds shift. Something bright moves behind them—sun, spotlight, who knows.

“I don’t know,” you whisper.

“Write it,” the other you says, tapping the blank page. “Not what you’ll do when you get the job. What you’ll do when you don’t.”

Your hand finds the pen again. This time it feels lighter.

You write slowly, honestly: *I will keep learning. I will keep making things. I will ask for help. I will rest. I will try again.* The words don’t sound like a résumé. They sound like a promise.

When you finish, the other you takes the folder and closes it gently, like putting a book back on a shelf.

“Congratulations,” they say. “You passed.”

A warm rush floods your chest—relief, grief, something like laughter. “So…do I win?”

The other you smiles, and it’s your smile, crooked in the familiar way.

“You already did,” they say. “You remembered what the job was supposed to be for.”

The room begins to brighten, the edges dissolving into light the way dreams do when they’re running out of time. The table fades. The second chair fades. The folder fades in your hands, but the weight of what you wrote stays, as if it has moved somewhere deeper.

The last thing you see before waking is your badge, floating in the air.

The word **TEMPORARY** peels off like a sticker and flutters away.

Underneath, in plain black letters, it now reads:

**PRESENT**

And then the applause track stops.

And the silence is so complete, so gentle, that it feels like permission.

You inhale—

—and wake up with the strange certainty that the competition isn’t over, but the prize has changed.

It isn’t a job.

It’s you, still here, still yours, ready to walk into whatever room comes next.
