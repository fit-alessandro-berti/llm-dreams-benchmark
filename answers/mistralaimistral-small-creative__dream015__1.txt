**Dream Continuation: *The Last Beacon***

---

The air smells of rust and damp earth as you step over the skeletal remains of a collapsed highway overpass, its steel bones groaning under the weight of time. The sky is a bruised purple, streaked with the faint glow of a dying sun—its light filtered through the perpetual haze of ash and dust. You adjust the tattered scarf around your face, the fabric stiff with sweat and the faint metallic tang of old blood (not yours, thankfully).

You’ve been walking for days, maybe weeks. Time blurs when every moment is a gamble. Your pack is light—too light. A half-empty canteen, a rusted multi-tool, a single bullet for the revolver at your hip (you’ve been saving it for something *worth* the noise). And the map, of course. The one you found in the ruins of the old library, its edges singed, the ink smudged by desperate fingers before yours. It marks a place called **Eden’s Spire**, a rumored sanctuary where the last remnants of the old world are said to have gathered. A lie, probably. But lies are all you’ve got left.

Then you see it.

A flicker of light in the distance—not the sickly green of bioluminescent fungi or the eerie glow of scavenger lanterns, but something *warm*. Orange. Like fire. Like *hope*.

You crouch behind the husk of a burned-out truck, heart hammering. The light comes from a cluster of shipping containers, jury-rigged into a makeshift fort. Smoke curls from a chimney pipe, and the low murmur of voices drifts on the wind. Your fingers tighten around the revolver. *Trappers? Raiders? Or…*

A child’s laugh.

It’s high and bright, the kind of sound that doesn’t belong in this world. You freeze. Children are rare now. Precious. Dangerous. The last time you saw one, they were being traded like currency in the slums of New Haven.

You creep closer, pressing yourself against the cold metal of the containers. Through a gap in the corrugated steel, you see them:

A group of survivors—maybe a dozen, maybe more—gathered around a fire. An old woman stirs a pot of something that smells like real food, not the synth-paste you’ve been surviving on. A man with a cybernetic eye sharpens a knife, his movements precise, lethal. And there, in the center, a girl no older than ten, her dark hair braided with strips of colored cloth, laughing as she tosses a ball to a scruffy dog.

Your breath catches.

Then the dog’s ears twitch. It turns, nose twitching, and lets out a low growl.

*Shit.*

The man with the cybernetic eye snaps his head up, knife stilling. His good eye locks onto the gap where you’re hiding.

“We’ve got company,” he says, voice calm, deadly.

The firelight flickers across his face as he stands, the knife now held loose at his side. Not a threat. Not yet.

The old woman doesn’t look up from her pot. “Friend or foe, boy?”

You swallow. The revolver feels heavy in your hand. You could run. You *should* run. But the smell of that stew, the sound of that laugh—

You step out from behind the container, hands raised, empty.

“I’m not here to fight,” you say, voice rough from disuse. “I’m looking for Eden’s Spire.”

Silence. The girl stops laughing. The dog bares its teeth.

Then the old woman chuckles, a dry, crackling sound. “Ain’t no such place, child. Just stories to keep the desperate moving.” She finally looks at you, her milky eyes sharp despite their age. “But you’re here now. And we don’t turn away the lost.”

The man with the cybernetic eye doesn’t lower his knife. “Prove you’re not a raider’s scout.”

You hesitate. Then, slowly, you reach into your pack and pull out the last thing of value you have: a small, tarnished locket. Inside is a photo of a family—your family, before the Collapse. You don’t remember their faces anymore, but you keep it anyway.

The man’s expression doesn’t change, but the girl gasps. “You have a *picture*?”

The old woman’s smile widens, revealing teeth too white, too perfect for this world. “Well now. That’s a first.”

The knife finally lowers.

“Welcome to the Last Beacon,” the man says. “Hope you like stew.”

And just like that, you’re not alone anymore.

**What happens next?**
- **Do you stay?** The Beacon is a haven, but havens have rules—and secrets. The old woman knows more than she lets on. The man with the cybernetic eye watches you like a predator sizing up prey. And the girl… she’s seen something in the wastes. Something *wrong*.
- **Do you leave at first light?** Trust is a luxury you can’t afford. The Beacon is warm, but warmth attracts things in the dark. You’ve survived this long by being alone.
- **Do you ask about the Spire?** The old woman called it a story, but stories have roots. If Eden’s Spire is real, it might be the key to rebuilding. Or it might be the reason the world ended in the first place.
- **Or something else?** The dream is yours. Where do you go from here?

*(Choose, or let the dream unfold on its own.)*
