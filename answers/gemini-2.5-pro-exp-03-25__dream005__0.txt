Okay, I'll lean into the dream state...

...The air hums with a discordant melody, like three different songs playing simultaneously but just out of sync. The light isn't quite right either; it pulses faintly, shifting from a warm amber to a cool blue, making colours seem unstable. It's crowded, bodies pressing close, the murmur of conversation a thick, unintelligible wave. I need to find Alex. Alex is my anchor here, the only familiar face in this sea of strangers.

I push gently through a cluster of people near what looks like a refreshment table, except instead of drinks, they're meticulously arranging tiny, iridescent beetles into complex geometric patterns on silver platters. They don't seem to be eating them, just... arranging. Their focus is absolute, their fingers moving with unnerving precision. I try to catch someone's eye, "Excuse me, have you seen Alex? Tall, red scarf?" but they don't look up. One person murmurs, without breaking concentration, "The seventh spiral requires symmetry," and continues their delicate work. The faint *click-skitter* of the beetles' legs is surprisingly loud beneath the music.

Feeling a prickle of unease, I move on, scanning the room. The shifting light makes faces hard to distinguish. I drift towards a group near a large, ornate fireplace that seems to be burning with cool, blue flames. These people aren't talking; they're communicating entirely through elaborate hand gestures, like a silent, fluid argument or a complex story unfolding. Their hands weave and flicker in the blue light, casting dancing shadows on the wall. One person notices me watching and makes a sharp, questioning gesture – a fist opening rapidly into splayed fingers, then closing slowly. I just shake my head, feeling inadequate, unable to ask my question in their silent language, and back away.

Further into the room, the music seems louder, coalescing into a heavy, rhythmic beat. Here, people are laughing, but it sounds... reversed? Like inhaling laughter. They're gathered around a fountain in the center of the room, but instead of water, thick, golden honey flows upwards, defying gravity before arcing back down into the basin. They dip strange, long-handled spoons into it, not to eat, but to draw shimmering threads of honey into the air, weaving them into temporary, glistening sculptures that slowly collapse back into the flow. One woman with eyes that seem far too bright catches my gaze and laughs that strange, inward laugh. "Looking? Or lost?" she asks, her voice echoing slightly, as if from the bottom of a well.

"I'm looking for Alex," I manage, feeling increasingly desperate.

She gestures vaguely with her honey-laden spoon towards the far side of the room. "Perhaps near the quiet corner. Where the echoes sleep."

The 'quiet corner' is draped in heavy, velvet curtains that absorb the sound. It *is* quieter here, muffled. But it's not empty. A single figure stands with their back to me, looking at a painting on the wall – a swirling chaos of colours that seems to writhe slightly. They're tall... they're wearing a scarf... it looks red in this dim, pulsing light.

"Alex?" I call out, relief washing over me. "Alex, thank god!"

The figure turns slowly. The scarf *is* red. But the face... it's not Alex. It's my own face, but older, lines etched around the eyes and mouth, looking back at me with an expression of profound weariness and slight pity.

"Still searching?" my reflection asks, its voice my own, but deeper, resonant with echoes.

Before I can answer, the floor beneath my feet turns soft, like damp earth. The velvet curtains ripple and flow like water, and the muffled sounds of the party distort, deepening into a low, guttural hum. The painting on the wall melts, dripping colour onto the yielding floor. My reflection smiles sadly, and begins to fade, just as the ground gives way entirely, and I start to fall, not downwards, but sideways, into the swirling colours of the melting painting, the hum growing louder and louder until it fills everything... and then... silence. The dream dissolves.
