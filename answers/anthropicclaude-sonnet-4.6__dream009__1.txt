# The Dream Continues...

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find your place before the sun sets.**

---

The air smells of woodsmoke and rain-soaked earth. You're standing at the edge of a village — stone cottages with thatched roofs, a cobblestone road worn smooth by centuries of footsteps. Somewhere nearby, a blacksmith's hammer rings like a slow bell.

You look down at your hands. They're your hands. But your clothes are wrong — too thin, too strange. People are noticing.

An old woman stops and stares at you with eyes like polished amber.

*"You have the look of someone who fell from somewhere else,"* she says quietly, in words you somehow understand.

You want to explain. You want to ask for a phone, for Google Maps, for *anything familiar.* But there is nothing. Only the smell of bread baking, the sound of chickens, and the vast, humbling **silence where machines used to be.**

The woman holds out a rough woolen cloak.

*"Cover yourself. Ask questions later. The village doesn't trust what it doesn't recognize."*

You take it.

And somewhere deep in your chest, beneath the fear—

something **ancient and calm** begins to wake up.

*What do you do next?*
