As the excitement builds, you settle into your role of "Champion of Dreams" at the prestigious Marathon Athletics Club, where you will compete against five top competitors to secure a coveted award. Your mind is racing with endless possibilities - from competing for fame to breaking a personal one-day record.

The room fills up when you see four opponents ready for the match between you and your partner, a talented but struggling singer named Maria. You have two months to prepare before the competition starts, working tirelessly to craft an unforgettable performance that will set you apart from the others.

As fate would have it, a fellow contestant joins you as your coach in training - a seasoned marathon runner who has honed her skills under the watchful eyes of your experienced teammate and mentors. This is just one moment in the dream but for now focus on the preparation that must come first: mastering the art of storytelling through music to ignite passion, inspiring those around you every day with vibrant laughter and energetic spirit.
