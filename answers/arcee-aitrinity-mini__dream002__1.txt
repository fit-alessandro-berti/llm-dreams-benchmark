The dream shifts abruptly from the serene forest to a scene of raw, elemental power. Here's how it continues, focusing on sensory details and emotional tension:

1.  **The Wind:** It doesn't just blow; it *roars*. A violent, twisting wind cuts through the canopy like a blade, snapping branches with sharp cracks. Leaves and twigs dance like dark sparks. You feel the force pushing you off-balance, urging you deeper into the forest's heart. It carries the smell of wet earth and ozone – a sharp, metallic scent that stings your nostrils.

2.  **The Rain:** It arrives in a torrent. Not the gentle patter of a shower, but a *wall* of water. It doesn't *fall*; it *smacks*, *pounds*, and *beats* down upon you with relentless force. Within seconds, your clothes are soaked through, clinging to your skin, and rivulets of water stream down your face, blurring your vision. The sound is deafening, a constant, heavy *thud-thud-thud* that drowns out other sounds.

3.  **The Temperature:** The oppressive heat of the pre-storm stillness vanishes instantly. A chilling, damp wind slices through you, sending shivers down your spine. The air becomes thick, humid, and oppressive, thick enough to feel like you're breathing water.

4.  **The Thunder:** Deep, resonant, and terrifyingly close, the thunder cracks like the earth itself shattering. It's not just sound; it's a physical vibration that shakes the bones in your chest. Each flash of lightning is a brutal, jagged knife of white light cutting through the impenetrable blackness of the sky, revealing the chaotic dance of leaves and the furious, churning rain. It's both awe-inspiring and utterly terrifying.

5.  **Your Body and Mind:**
    *   Your heart pounds a frantic rhythm against your ribs, matching the thunder's beat.
    *   Your breath comes in short, sharp gasps, ragged and uneven.
    *   Adrenaline floods your system, sharpening your senses but also making you feel incredibly vulnerable.
    *   Fear, primal and immediate, grips you. This isn't just discomfort; this is a force you need to navigate or escape from.
    *   The peaceful solitude is utterly obliterated by the storm's fury and your own racing thoughts.

6.  **The Focus:** You instinctively look for shelter – a large, sturdy tree? A cave? Anything that offers even momentary respite from the relentless assault of wind and water. Your eyes scan the blurred, rain-lashed surroundings, searching for an anchor point, a place to wait out the worst of the tempest.

**What happens next is up to you, the dreamer, but the core shift is complete: the calm, green sanctuary has become a hostile, elemental battleground.** The question now is: **How do you react? Do you seek shelter? Do you press on through the storm's heart? Do you encounter something unexpected amidst the chaos – a hidden figure, a fallen bridge, a strange light piercing the storm?** The storm defines the moment.
