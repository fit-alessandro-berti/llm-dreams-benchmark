As you begin to speak, your voice is strong and confident. You've prepared for this moment for weeks, and you feel ready to share your message with the world. But as you continue speaking, you start to notice something strange happening.

Your notes, which should be in front of you on the podium, have disappeared. You try to remember the rest of your speech, but your mind is blank. Panic sets in as you struggle to recall what you had planned to say.

Suddenly, the microphone cuts out. The audience starts to murmur, and you feel your heart pounding in your chest. This is not how it was supposed to go. You try to fix the microphone, but your hands are shaking so badly that you can't get a grip on it.

Then, out of nowhere, someone from the audience throws a tomato at you. It splatters against your shirt, and the crowd gasps. More vegetables start flying your way, and you realize that you are in the middle of a full-blown food fight. People are yelling, throwing things, and you are completely lost.

Just when you think it can't get any worse, you realize that you are completely naked. The crowd is staring at you, their mouths agape, and you feel utterly humiliated. You try to run off the stage, but your legs won't move. You are stuck in this nightmare.

Finally, you wake up, gasping for air. It was just a dream. You take a deep breath and remind yourself that you are safe and sound in your bed. But you can't help feeling relieved that it was just a dream and not real.
