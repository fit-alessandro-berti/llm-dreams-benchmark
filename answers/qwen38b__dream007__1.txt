You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to walk away, not because you’re ready to surrender, but because you need space to listen to the silence between your words. The air feels thick, charged with unspoken truths, and the room around you begins to shimmer—walls melting into a vast, starry expanse. Your friend, now a silhouette against the cosmos, calls your name, their voice echoing with a mix of anger and sorrow.  

You stop, heart racing, and realize the argument wasn’t just about the surface issue—it was a mirror, reflecting unresolved tensions, unmet needs, or old wounds. The stars above pulse in rhythm with your breath, and a sudden, surreal clarity washes over you. You turn to face them, not to defend yourself, but to ask, *“What did I miss?”*  

Your friend’s silhouette softens, and they step closer, their form dissolving into a cascade of memories: laughter, shared dreams, moments when you were both vulnerable and unyielding. The argument fades, replaced by a haunting truth—you’ve been fighting to protect your own fragile sense of self, afraid to confront the fear of losing them.  

In the dream’s climax, you reach out, not to reconcile, but to *see*. The stars collapse into a single point of light, and you’re back in the room, but now the air is still. Your friend is there, eyes glistening, and for the first time, you’re both silent—not because the storm passed, but because you’ve learned to listen to the quiet.  

The dream ends with you sitting side by side, the unresolved tension now a shared weight, lighter than before.
