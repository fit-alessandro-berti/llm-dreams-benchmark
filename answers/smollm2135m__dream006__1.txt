As I stand atop my grand stage, surrounded by an aura of anticipation, I take a deep breath in as I adjust my mask to create a perfect illusion of being seated. The soundscape begins to recede into the background, enveloping the audience with a palpable sense of calm and serenity that is both captivating and soothing.

With my mouth pressed firmly on my throat, I exhale deeply while maintaining a firm contact with the stage as I gaze outward at a flurry of eager faces, each one eagerly waiting in anticipation for their turn to speak. The energy around me vibrates with a sense of anticipation, conjuring up images of moments past – perhaps this time – when I first gained credibility through my groundbreaking innovations and relentless determination.

With a brief moment's pause before speaking, the audience gathers from across the stage, awaiting my words as if in expectation that, after all these years, they will be able to listen again.
