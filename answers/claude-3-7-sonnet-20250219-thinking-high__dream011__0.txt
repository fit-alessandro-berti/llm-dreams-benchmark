# The Final Exam Dream

You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a strange, shifting script that seems to change whenever you try to focus on them. Panic rises in your chest.

Looking around, you see other students writing furiously, completely unfazed by the bizarre questions. You blink hard, and suddenly the first question becomes clear: \Describe in detail a memory you've forgotten completely.\ pencil feels impossibly heavy in your hand. When you finally manage to press it to paper, it leaves no mark. The clock on the wall is moving twice as fast as it should.

You raise your hand to ask for help, but the professor, whose face keeps blurring whenever you try to look directly at them, doesn't notice you. Somehow, you know with absolute certainty that you've been attending the wrong class all semester.

Just as despair overwhelms you, the exam paper transforms into a map. You realize this isn't a test of what you've memorized, but of who you are. The questions are now writing themselves based on your thoughts, offering paths rather than problems.

With sudden clarity, you begin to write, your pencil now flowing effortlessly across the page. The answers come from somewhere deep within you, revealing truths about yourself you never consciously knew.

You wake just as you hand in your completed exam, feeling strangely accomplished despite never seeing your grade.
