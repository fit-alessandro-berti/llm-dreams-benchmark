You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you gratefully accept, following them through neon-lit alleys that twist like veins of light. Their faces shimmer, half-shadowed smiles promising home, but as you turn a corner, the streets fold inward—the city becomes a labyrinth of mirrors, reflecting infinite versions of yourself, each more frantic than the last.

One stranger, with eyes like polished obsidian, whispers, "The way out is through the heart of the crowd." You plunge deeper, hands brushing yours in the throng, until the ground tilts and you're falling upward into a sky of floating lanterns. Laughter echoes from below, and there—amid the stars—you spot your childhood home, door ajar, warm light spilling out. You reach for it, heart pounding, but the strangers dissolve into fireflies, guiding you awake as the dream fades to dawn.
