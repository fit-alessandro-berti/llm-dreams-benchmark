You are walking through a peaceful forest, sunlight dappling the mossy path beneath your feet. Birds sing in the canopy, and the air smells of pine and earth. Suddenly, the light dims. The wind kicks up, whipping the branches into a frenzy, and the sky turns an eerie shade of violet. Thunder rumbles, deep and resonant, as if the storm is *alive*.  

The trees begin to sway unnaturally, their trunks groaning as they twist toward you. Rain falls in sharp, silver streaks, but it doesn’t feel like water—it hums, like static electricity, prickling your skin. A distant flash of lightning reveals something moving in the mist: a shadowy figure, tall and slender, with glowing amber eyes. It doesn’t walk. It *shimmers*, flickering in and out of the storm like a glitch.  

Your heart races. Do you:  

1. **Run toward the figure**, drawn by an inexplicable pull, as if it’s calling your name without sound?  
2. **Seek shelter** beneath the roots of an ancient, hollow tree, where a faint blue light pulses like a heartbeat?  
3. **Stand your ground**, shouting into the wind, demanding to know what the storm wants?  

The dream holds its breath, waiting for your choice—and whatever comes next.
