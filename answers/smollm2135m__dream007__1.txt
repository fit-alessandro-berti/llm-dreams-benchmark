I was torn between two paths: one for her and another for me. We stood up to each other, my eyes scanning the room, but I didn't see him. In a moment of weakness, I turned to my friend, hoping he might be present and willing to listen, yet also aware that it would not necessarily go into effect until later.

As we spoke, our voices muffled behind their headsets, leaving a sense of anticipation lingering in the air like a rumble. We exchanged brief glances but no direct contact took place until the last moment during which I was left standing alone with my friend at an adjacent table as if he wasn't present for the entire conversation.

The heat and sweat intensified around me as I waited, my breath stung in response to the air conditioning on the other side of the room being turned up too high. My friend, a gruff yet charming man named Mark, nodded attentively but didn`t participate or share the story with us. His eyes locked onto mine for an instant as if mesmerized by his sudden transformation.

The silence was oppressive and my thoughts drifted back to when we first started arguing about this crucial topic in person. I was at some stage of a decision that should be carefully weighing, whether it's our friendship or not, but without him being present around the table where we were able to share it without tension...we felt like we just went through the motions again while he waited on us from his side. He gave me this look which still haunts me today as I think what was that moment telling my mind?
