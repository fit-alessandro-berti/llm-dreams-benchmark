Okay, sinking deeper into the dream...

You start to **panic**, a cold wave washing over you despite the oddly warm, humming air of the city. Your heart hammers against your ribs like a trapped bird. You spin around, trying to get your bearings, but the architecture is impossible – buildings twist like taffy, streets intersect at Escher-like angles, and the sky pulses with colours you don't have names for.

You desperately **check your pockets**, hoping for a phone, an address, *anything*. You pull out a handful of smooth, grey river stones that chime faintly when they touch. Useless. Then, a crumpled piece of paper. Hope surges! You unfold it eagerly, but it's blank... no, wait. As you stare, iridescent symbols like constellations begin to bloom across its surface, shifting and reforming, offering no discernible pattern or direction.

A nearby clock tower, whose face is a swirling vortex of numbers, chimes. The sound is distorted, like bells underwater, and it makes your teeth ache. *Time is slipping away.*

You decide to **ask for directions**. You spot a figure leaning against a lamppost made of luminous crystal. As you approach, you realize they're wearing a suit woven from shadows and their face is obscured by a swarm of shimmering moths. "Excuse me," you stammer, the words feeling thick and sticky in your mouth, "I have a meeting... very important... do you know where the..."

The figure doesn't speak, but tilts its head. The moths rearrange themselves, momentarily forming a fleeting image – a doorway shaped like a keyhole, impossibly tall, standing alone in a square filled with statues that weep rainwater. The image dissolves back into a fluttering cloud.

Alleyways narrow into crevices you have to squeeze through sideways. Grand boulevards abruptly end in sheer drops overlooking churning, phosphorescent fog. People pass by, some walking backwards, others floating inches off the ground, their faces serene or contorted in silent laughter, none paying you any mind.

You run faster, the river stones jingling in your pocket, the sound of the underwater bells echoing in your ears. The pavement beneath your feet feels spongy, then like brittle glass, threatening to shatter with each step. You glance back – was that the moth-figure following you? Or just your own lengthening shadow, detaching itself to wave mockingly? The meeting... you have to get to the meeting... but the city seems determined to swallow you whole before you can even find the door. You turn a corner sharply, hoping, praying this is the way, and run straight into...
