You feel a storm approaching and the wind begins to howl through the trees, stirring the leaves into a swirling dance around you. Dark clouds gather overhead, turning the daylight into a dusky twilight. Suddenly, a flash of lightning illuminates the forest, etching every branch and leaf in stark silver.  

Despite the growing storm, you feel an unexpected calm wash over you. The raindrops begin to fall, soft at first, then heavier, drenching the earth and filling the air with a fresh, earthy scent. As the thunder rumbles, you notice a faint glow deeper in the forest, beckoning you forward.  

Drawn by curiosity, you step carefully along a hidden path. The storm seems to pause around this mysterious light, creating a pocket of peace amid the chaos. When you reach the source, you discover an ancient, enormous tree with a radiant golden heart pulsing within its trunk — as if the forest itself is alive and cradling you beneath its protective boughs.  

The storm fades into a gentle rain, and you stand in awe beneath the glowing tree, feeling a profound sense of connection, wonder, and serenity.
