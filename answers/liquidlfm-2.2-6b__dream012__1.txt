You gaze out at the roiling black seas below, the wind howling with a fury only the old souls know. The ship skirts the edge of a storm system, its sails snapped, deck awash with the weight of waves crashing over the bow. Your heart pounds—not out of fear, but from resolve. You’ve never been one to back down.

You turn to your most experienced mate, Elias, eyes narrowed against the din. “We need to change course,” you say, voice steady despite the tremor in your hands. “Heather’s tail will shelter us downstream for a bit—just enough to regroup. The ship’s holding, but she’s being pushed toward the breach.”

Elias nods, already scrambling to adjust the rigging. “Looks like the fog’s thickening behind us. Let’s try to sense the horizon through it.”

You clutch the wheel tighter, feeling the creak of the oak beneath your grip, then suddenly— a flash of light through the mist. A floating cove, partially hidden, where the water is still and dark currents suggest a safe passage. Without hesitation, you order: *Abstall! Turn to starboard!* The engine roars back to life, and the ship rises, narrowly missing a cliff of foam and wind.

As the storm surges forward, you lock eyes with the viewport. Silence falls—temporary. Then, you spot it: the faint outline of a lighthouse ahead, its beam slicing through the dark like a finger. It’s cracked, its wall broken, but burning. Hope found.

You steam toward it, not with fear, but with purpose. You are not alone. And the night, for the first time in days, feels like it’s united with the light, pulling you forward toward calm.
