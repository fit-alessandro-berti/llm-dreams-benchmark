… feel panic rising in your chest. The office around you suddenly seems larger than normal, the rows of cubicles stretching into a kind of haze under flickering fluorescent lights. Your boss, who a moment ago was just a familiar face, now feels like a towering silhouette looming over your shoulder. Her expression is neutral but expectant—eyes fixed on you, silently demanding you begin. 

Your computer’s monitor hums quietly, the screen a glaring white canvas with a blinking cursor. You can’t remember what the project is actually about—only that it requires data you’ve never seen and expertise you don’t have. You try to open a file, but the folders on your desktop are mislabeled, each one spawning even more nonsensically named subfolders: “Q3DraftsForTomorrow,” “DustedArchives,” “NeverEndingReferences.” Clicking into them is like diving deeper into a maze of confusion. The panic intensifies as you realize you’re running out of time—whatever the deadline is, it feels as if it were set for right this second.

In the corner of the office, a grandfather clock you’ve never noticed before begins to chime. With each chime, the lighting changes, now bathing everything in a surreal, greenish glow. Your coworkers seem unaffected; they move in slow, purposeful loops, as if caught in a repeating cycle of work tasks that never resolve. You look up to ask your boss a question, but she’s gone. In her place is a series of Post-it notes stacked up as tall as a person, each scribbled with nonsense words and scribbled arrows pointing in all directions. 

Your heart pounds as you realize you’re alone with this impossible task. You try to type something—anything—into the blank document, but when your fingers hit the keys, they produce music notes instead of letters. A soft, piano-like melody emerges, and for a moment, the sound calms you. You look around and notice that the walls have started to bend inward, making the office feel more like a cocoon than a workspace. The music you’re accidentally creating seems to counter the oppressive feeling of impending failure. 

Then, without warning, a voice whispers in your ear: “It’s not about finishing; it’s about starting.” The voice is gentle, and you realize it belongs to no one you can see. Emboldened, you try typing once more. This time, the keys produce letters. You write a single sentence about what you do know—your own confusion. As soon as you complete it, a small window pops up on your screen containing a set of instructions. They’re cryptic, but they somehow make sense now. You follow them, step by step. 

Your boss reappears, smiling calmly. The towering Post-its have melted back into her familiar face. The deadlines and demands suddenly feel less like a personal indictment and more like a puzzle you can piece together, given enough time. Outside the window, where you are certain a city should be, there’s only a shifting tapestry of colors and shapes, as if the world is painting itself anew. You feel strangely at peace, even though nothing is resolved. 

As the dream begins to fade, you find yourself still typing, the words flowing effortlessly. You understand that in this strange, elastic world of your subconscious, the impossible projects and impossible deadlines were never about failing—they were about discovering your own calm center in the midst of chaos. And just as your boss leans in to read your words, the world dissolves into the soft blur of awakening.
