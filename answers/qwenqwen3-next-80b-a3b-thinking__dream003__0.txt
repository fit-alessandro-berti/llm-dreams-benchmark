The box rests in the palm of your hand, cold but humming like a tuning fork struck in a cavern. Its surface is carved with swirls that shift when you look away—like constellations rearranging themselves. Run your fingers over them, and they warm to the touch, glowing faintly blue. The patterns aren’t just lines; they’re whispers. *Remember the old oak?* they seem to say. *The one by the creek where you cried when you were seven?*  

You close your eyes. The forest clearing where you first found the box dissolves. Suddenly, you’re back there—the smell of damp earth, the creek’s chuckle, the way the sunset painted the sky peach and lavender. A lullaby drifts into your mind: your grandmother’s voice, soft and cracked, humming as she braided your hair. *“The key isn’t held, it’s held within.”*  

You open your eyes. The box pulses once, golden now, and the intricate patterns I’ve traced on it begin to unfold. At the center, a seam appears—not built to hold a key, but a heart. You place your palm flat against it, pressing hard enough to feel your heartbeat sync with its rhythm. A soft *click*. Not mechanical, but like a door opening in a dream.  

Inside, there’s no gold or jewels. Just a single acorn, smooth as polished stone, glowing with the same warm light as the box. Tucked beneath it, a tiny mirror reflects not your face, but your seven-year-old self—grinning, covered in mud, holding a dragonfly. The memory floods back: that summer, you buried the dragonfly under the oak, believing it would hatch into a bird. You were wrong. But you also weren’t. It *did* hatch—you just didn’t know how.  

As you hold the acorn, it begins to sprout in your mind’s eye: roots diving deep, a sapling stretching toward the sun. The lullaby returns, louder now, and you realize it’s not your grandmother’s voice—it’s your own, the one you forgot.  

The box closes gently. The clearing fades. You wake up gasping, sunlight streaming through your window. For a moment, you’re certain the acorn is still in your palm. But when you open your hand—nothing. Nothing but an ache in your chest that feels like hope. And outside, the distant sound of birds singing an old song.
