You are dreaming.

You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and… **a faint hum emanating from within.** The patterns aren't just etched into the surface; they seem to shift and pulse with the low thrum. It's not a mechanical sound, but more like a living vibration, like the beating of a tiny heart. The box is made of a dark, smooth material, almost like obsidian, but with a warmth to it that belies its cool appearance.

You run your fingers over the shifting patterns, feeling a slight tingling sensation. As your touch lingers on a specific swirling knot, the hum intensifies, and a single rune at the center of the knot begins to glow with a soft, ethereal blue light. The light expands, illuminating the surrounding dreamscape, which until now had been a rather vague, misty space.

Suddenly, walls begin to form around you, made of the same dark, smooth material as the box. The air grows thick with anticipation. You realize that the box isn't just an object; it's a key. It's a key to this evolving space, a room that is forming around you, born from the box itself.

The blue light pulses again, and the rune shifts. Now, instead of a glow, it projects a series of symbols onto the newly formed walls. These symbols aren't any language you recognize, yet a deep understanding of their meaning washes over you. They are instructions, or perhaps a puzzle.

The air around you crackles with energy, the hum of the box resonates deep within your chest. A feeling of both trepidation and incredible excitement fills you. You understand, instinctively, that what you do with this box, and with the symbols before you, will determine what lies ahead, within this dream and perhaps beyond. You know that you must solve the puzzle to unlock the box, and in doing so, unlock something deeper within yourself. The dream feels… alive, expectant, and the only thing you can think is: *what happens next?*
