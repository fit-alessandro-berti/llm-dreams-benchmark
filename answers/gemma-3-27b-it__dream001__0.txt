You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to **panic, a cold knot tightening in your stomach.** The city isn't like any you've seen before. Buildings twist and curve in impossible angles, constructed from a shimmering, obsidian-like material. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency that vibrates in your teeth. 

I instinctively check my pockets. Nothing. No phone, no address, no even a scrap of paper. Just the clothes on my back – a surprisingly comfortable, though utterly out-of-place, tweed suit. 

Okay, breathe. Think. The meeting… it felt *important*. Crucially important. Like the fate of… something rested on it. But what? And with whom? The details are frustratingly blurry, like trying to grasp smoke.

I decide to ask for help. I spot a figure gliding through the crowd – not walking, *gliding*. They’re tall and slender, draped in flowing, silver fabric, their face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. 

“Excuse me!” I call out, my voice sounding thin and reedy in the city’s hum. The figure pauses, turning slowly. As they turn, I notice they don’t have a face *under* the hat. Just… swirling, iridescent mist.

“Lost, are you?” the figure asks, the voice a chorus of whispers. It doesn’t seem surprised to see me, more…expectant.

“I… I have a meeting. In an hour. I don’t know where to go.”

The figure tilts its head, the mist within the hat swirling faster. “The Obsidian Accord. A weighty matter. You are expected. But the path is not given freely. You must answer a riddle.”

A shiver runs down my spine. A riddle? This is getting stranger and stranger. 

“Alright,” I say, trying to sound braver than I feel. “Ask me your riddle.”

The figure’s voice drops to a near-silent murmur. “I have no voice, yet I speak to all. I have no body, yet I can build and destroy. I have no life, yet I outlive empires. What am I?”

I stare at the figure, my mind racing. The city’s hum seems to intensify, pressing in on me. An hour. I have an hour. And a riddle standing between me and… whatever this meeting is. 

Then, a flash of insight. A memory, not my own, but *felt* as if it were. Ancient libraries, crumbling scrolls, the weight of ages…

“Stories!” I blurt out. “The answer is stories!”

The mist within the hat stills. A moment of silence hangs in the air, thick and heavy. Then, a slow, ethereal chuckle.

“Correct. The path is revealed.” The figure raises a hand, and a shimmering, silver thread extends from its fingertips, pointing down a narrow, winding alleyway. “Follow the thread. It will lead you to the Obsidian Accord. But be warned… the Accord demands a price.”



And with that, the figure glides away, disappearing into the crowd, leaving me standing alone with the silver thread and a growing sense of dread. I take a deep breath and start to walk, the thread pulling me deeper into the labyrinthine heart of the city. The hour is ticking. And I have a feeling this meeting is going to change everything.
