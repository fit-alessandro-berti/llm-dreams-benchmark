You are dreaming. You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel a surge of panic rising inside you. The room seems to blur around you as the clock ticks unbearably fast. Desperately, you search for a way to finish the task, but every attempt is met with chaos—papers flying, screens flickering, time slipping through your fingers. Just as the pressure peaks, the dream shifts: you find yourself in a serene, endless library where solutions await on every shelf. Calm washes over you as you realize that no deadline is truly impossible when patience and ingenuity come into play.
