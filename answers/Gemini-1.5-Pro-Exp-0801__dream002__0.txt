... and the air grows thick with the scent of pine and damp earth. The playful dance of sunlight filtering through the leaves is abruptly extinguished as the sky above transforms into a bruised, swirling canvas of grays and blacks. A guttural rumble echoes through the trees, shaking the very ground beneath my feet. The wind, previously a gentle caress, now whips through the branches, tearing leaves from their moorings and sending them spiraling through the air like frightened birds.
I break into a run, seeking shelter, but the trees offer little solace. Rain begins to fall, fat, icy drops that sting my skin. The forest floor turns to mud, sucking at my shoes with each desperate step. Lightning cracks the sky, illuminating the woods in stark, fleeting flashes, revealing twisted, gnarled branches reaching out like skeletal fingers.
Then, I see it. A faint glow emanating from within a thicket of ancient oaks. Hope surges through me, a fragile beacon in the encroaching darkness. I push through the tangled undergrowth, thorns tearing at my clothes, until I reach the source of the light.
It's a small cottage, nestled amongst the trees like a hidden treasure. The windows glow with warm, inviting light, and smoke curls from its chimney, promising refuge and warmth. As I stumble towards the door, a figure emerges, silhouetted against the golden light. A woman, her face hidden in the shadows, but her outstretched hand beckoning me inside.
Hesitantly, I reach for her hand... and then I wake up. The remnants of the storm linger in the air, the scent of rain clinging to my sheets. My heart pounds in my chest, the echo of the dream still vibrating within me. I lie there, pondering the woman in the cottage, the mysterious light, the unsettling beauty of the storm. Was it just a dream, or something more? The question hangs in the air, unanswered, as the first rays of dawn creep through my window, chasing away the shadows of the night.
