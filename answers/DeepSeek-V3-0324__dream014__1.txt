...follow them through winding streets that glow under the warm light of streetlamps. The strangers share stories and laughter, making the unfamiliar city feel a little more like home. As you walk, the noise of the crowd fades into a gentle hum, and you notice small, beautiful details—a mural of a soaring bird, the scent of fresh bread from a bakery, a musician playing a soft melody on a corner.  

Eventually, you arrive at a quiet square with a fountain at its center. One of the strangers smiles and points to a path leading out of the city, saying, *"This is where you need to go—your way is clearer now."*  

As you step forward, the dream shifts—the city blurs, and you wake with a sense of calm, as if the kindness of those strangers lingers with you even in the waking world.  

Would you like to explore the meaning of this dream, or add more to the story?
