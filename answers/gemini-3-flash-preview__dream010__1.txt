...and the walls of the corporate board room begin to ripple like water, dissolving into a vast, violet-tinted moor. The other candidates, once dressed in sharp suits, are now draped in robes made of starlight and fog.

The next challenge isn’t a technical interview; it is **The Trial of the Echo.** A giant, ancient owl perched on a floating mahogany desk tells me that to win the role of "Architect of Horizons," I must capture the sound of a secret I have never told anyone. I reach into the air, and my hands find a thread of golden light. I pull it, and the sound of my childhood laughter—the specific one from a summer evening I’d long forgotten—fills the air. The owl nods, its eyes glowing like embers.

The final round takes place at the summit of a mountain made entirely of glass. I am standing before a mirror that doesn't show my reflection, but rather a doorway into a room I recognize as my own home, yet everything is slightly "more." The plants are singing, the light through the window is a color that doesn't exist in the waking world, and on the desk lies a contract written in ink that pulses like a heartbeat.

The CEO—a figure whose face is a shifting mosaic of everyone I have ever loved—steps forward and hands me a fountain pen carved from a fallen star. 

"The job is yours," the figure whispers, their voice sounding like wind through autumn leaves. "But the salary is paid in memories. You must give up your yesterday to live in this tomorrow."

I hesitate, the pen heavy in my hand. I look back at the glass mountain, seeing the other candidates fading into mist. I realize the competition wasn't against them, but against my own fear of letting go. I press the nib to the paper, and as the ink touches the page, the glass mountain shatters into a million diamonds. 

I don't fall. I fly. 

The wind rushes past my ears, carrying the scent of ozone and old books. The sky turns into a deep, velvety black, and just as I am about to take my seat in the office of the clouds, the sensation of gravity returns with a jolt. The violet moor and the starlight robes vanish, replaced by the weight of my blanket and the steady, rhythmic ticking of the clock on my nightstand.

I open my eyes, the "contract" still burning in my mind, a lingering heat in my palm where the star-pen had been. I am awake, but as I look at the morning sun hitting the wall, I realize I didn't lose the job. I just brought the blueprint back with me.
