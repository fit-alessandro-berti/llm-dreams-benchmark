... gather the broken tips from a shattered radio, hampered by static but determined to find a signal. Through the smoke and ash, I spot a few makeshift fires flickering in the distance—likely sheltered from the worst of the chaos. I run, leaving behind a crumpled note I hope someone will understand: *"Share what you have. We’re not alone. We need each other."*

I find a signal—weak, clunky, but promising. After what feels like hours, the voice of a distant settlement comes through, faint but real. I scramble to work the old radio’s knobs, dialing a number I once thought lost to madness. Just as I make contact, a siren screams overhead—thrown vehicles, panicked horses, chaos. The transmission cuts out, replaced by a groan of metal shaking.

I press on, following the faint trace of that signal now. Mountains loom ahead, but somewhere behind them, I hear a rhythm—someone else gathering fire, maybe tools, maybe people. Trusting no one easily but needing hope, I carve a simple sign on a sturdy tree: **PEACE.** Somewhere out there, survival might mean more than just scrapping by. Maybe it means building something new.

And somewhere, beneath the darkness, there’s a chance.
