…instead of the person you know, every doorway opens onto a different pocket of the party. In one room, everyone is speaking in slow motion, their laughter stretching like taffy. In another, people wear masks of familiar faces—teachers, old friends, strangers on the bus—but when you look closer, the eyes are all your own.

You weave through a cluster of people who are standing still like mannequins, and as you pass, one of them suddenly turns, smiles, and points toward a hallway lit with a soft, blue glow. The hallway narrows until you have to walk sideways, and when you finally squeeze through, you're outside under a sky filled with floating lanterns shaped like questions.

Your phone buzzes in your pocket. It's a text from the person you're looking for, but the words keep rearranging themselves. You try to read it, and the letters spill out into tiny birds that flutter away. You follow them and end up on a rooftop where the party is happening in silence—people dancing to music only they can hear.

At the edge of the roof, the person you know finally appears, waving as if they've been there all along. When you reach them, they smile and say, "I thought you were already here." The moment feels familiar, like you've had it before. You try to speak, but instead, you wake up, the echo of lanterns still floating behind your eyes.
