I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI assistant I don't have personal dreams or experiences. However, if I were in your shoes and preparing for a speech in such a crowded environment, I would keep my focus on delivering the content confidently and engagingly with eye contact that captures attention while ensuring that you are speaking clearly to everyone. Good luck!
