The rain lashes my face as I grip the helm, salt spray biting at my eyes. The mast groans beneath the fury of the wind, and I can feel the ship pitching violently beneath my boots.

"ALL HANDS TO THE MAINSAIL!" I bellow into the chaos. "BAIL THE HOLD! EVERY MAN TO HIS POST!"

The crew moves with desperate urgency. Young Tom, barely more than a boy, scrambles up the rigging despite the deck tilting at a dangerous angle. Old Maren hauls on a rope, his weathered hands blistered but unwavering.

The waves crash over the bow like judgment itself. The sky has turned an unnatural green-gray, lightning flickering in the distant clouds. This storm—this demon of the deep—it wants us.

But I will not give it this ship.

"BEAR NORTH BY NORTHWEST!" I call to the helmsman. "We'll ride the current! Every man hold fast!"

I stare into the churning darkness ahead, my voice steady though my heart hammers against my ribs. Somewhere beyond this tempest lies calm water. I have to believe it. They have to believe it—because belief is what keeps a crew together when the sea tries to tear them apart.

The ship dips into a trough, rises, dips again. My hands ache. My throat burns from shouting.

But I am the captain.

And this ship will not sink. Not today.
