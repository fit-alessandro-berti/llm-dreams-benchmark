As you stumble through the skeletal remains of a once-vibrant city, the air hums with ancient echoes. You pause to collect a single shard of obsidian from a tree that has long withered, its surface etched with forgotten scripts. The world is vast, yet the only clue to its purpose lies in *the hidden glade beneath the hollowed earth.* With a quiet act of kindness, you place the shard in the earth, its light now dimming like a heartbeat. The glade, a sanctuary of time, begins to stir, waiting for something—to be found.
