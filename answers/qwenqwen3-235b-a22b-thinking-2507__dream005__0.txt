You weave through a sea of unfamiliar faces, the thrum of conversation rising like steam in the overheated room. Sweat pricks your neck. *Just find Maya. Just find Maya.* The first group you bump intoâ€”a cluster of people laughing too loudly over cocktailsâ€”parts slightly, their eyes sliding over you like youâ€™re invisible glass. One womanâ€™s gaze lingers for a second, her smile sharp as a paper cut, before she turns back to her companions. You catch fragments: *"...venture capital..." "...disrupted the paradigm..."* Their energy is magnetic but repelling, a vortex of forced confidence that leaves you feeling like a stray leaf caught in a hurricane. You duck away, heart pounding.  

Next, you drift toward a quieter corner where three people stand in a tight triangle, speaking in low, urgent tones. They pause as you approach, their eyes locking onto you with unnerving stillness. One manâ€™s fingers tap a frantic rhythm against his thigh. A womanâ€™s knuckles are white around her glass. Someone says, *"The signalâ€™s already been sent,"* before they all glance away, pretending you donâ€™t exist. Their silence feels heavier than the loud groupâ€™s noiseâ€”a quiet dread that seeps into your bones. You back out, wondering if youâ€™ve just witnessed something dangerous, or if your own panic is making shadows where there are none.  

Then, near a balcony draped in velvet curtains, you see them: a group bathed in soft light, laughing like theyâ€™re in a perfume ad. Theyâ€™re *effortlessly* connectedâ€”leaning in, touching arms, eyes crinkling with genuine warmth. You freeze. This is the kind of belonging you crave. But as you take a hesitant step forward, one of them turns. Her smile widens, perfectly symmetrical, but her eyes stay cold and glassy, like polished stones. She doesnâ€™t stop talking, but her body subtly angles *away*, creating an invisible wall. The warmth is a performance. You swallow hardâ€”you donâ€™t belong *here* either.  

Just as the room starts to tilt, a hand touches your elbow. Mayaâ€™s face appears, flushed and apologetic. "Iâ€™ve been looking *everywhere* for you!" she says, pulling you toward the balcony. Outside, the city glitters below, cool air washing over your skin. She leans against the railing, voice dropping: "I thought Iâ€™d lose you in that crowd. Itâ€™s... a lot, isnâ€™t it?"  

You nod, the tension in your shoulders easing. But then she turns to you, her eyes suddenly serious. "Wait," she whispers, pointing back inside. Through the glass, the quiet group is now staring *directly* at you. The man who tapped his fingers holds up a small, antique key. The woman with white knuckles mouths two words:  
***"Not safe."***  

Maya grabs your hand. "We need to leave. *Now.* But... I donâ€™t know the way out."  
Her palm is clammy. Your pulse hammers in your throat. The key, the warning, the keyâ€”the dream *wants* something from you.  

**Do you:**  
A) Pull Maya toward the main exit, trusting the crowd to part for you?  
B) Follow the key-holder into the dim hallway behind the velvet curtains?  
C) Wake yourself up by pinching your armâ€”*hard*?  

*(The dream holds its breath. Your choice shapes the next layer.)* ðŸ’¤
