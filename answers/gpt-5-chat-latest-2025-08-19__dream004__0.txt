…and when you approach it, the canvas seems to breathe. Each inhale ripples across its surface like water, and each exhale splashes fragments of half-formed patterns into the air.  

When you lift your hand toward it, color drips from your fingertips—liquid, glowing strokes that float instead of falling. As soon as they touch the canvas, they blossom into entire scenes: you see doorways opening into hidden gardens, staircases spiraling upward to nowhere, constellations rearranging themselves into shapes that feel like forgotten memories.  

The strange thing is that the canvas doesn’t keep these images static—once created, they melt, reshuffle, and slip off the fabric of reality to pool at your feet as liquid imagination. You realize that the canvas isn’t something you’re painting on, but something you’re painting *with.*  

Then a voice—not spoken but resonant inside your chest—says, **“Choose carefully. What you paint will guide your next path.”**  

In that moment, you can feel the potential humming in your hands. Do you paint a door, a companion, a sky to fly through—or something completely unexpected?  

Would you like me to continue the dream by offering you a path forward, or would you rather choose what to paint first?
