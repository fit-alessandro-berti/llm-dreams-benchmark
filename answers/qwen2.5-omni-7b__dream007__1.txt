walk away from the situation. As you start to leave, your friend calls out to you, asking if everything is okay. You hesitate for a moment before responding that it's fine and that you'll talk later.

As you continue walking, you notice that the world around you seems different than usual. The colors are more vibrant, and the sounds seem louder. You also feel a sense of calmness that you haven't experienced in a long time.

Suddenly, you realize that you're not alone. There are other people around you, but they all look like versions of yourself. Some are wearing different clothes or have different hairstyles, but their faces are all the same - yours.

You turn to one of them and ask what's going on. They explain that this is your dream, and that you've been having these arguments with different versions of yourself for as long as you can remember. Each version represents a different aspect of your personality, and the arguments are a way for you to work through your conflicts.

You feel a mix of surprise and curiosity as you learn more about this strange phenomenon. You begin to explore the different versions of yourself, trying to understand why each one behaves differently. As you do so, you realize that by understanding yourself better, you may be able to resolve some of your own internal conflicts.

Eventually, you wake up, feeling refreshed and renewed. You know that you still have a lot to learn about yourself, but you're excited to see where this journey takes you.
