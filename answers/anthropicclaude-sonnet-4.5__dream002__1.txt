...the sky darkens to a deep purple-grey, swirling with impossible speed. The trees begin to whisper—not rustling, but actually *whispering* in voices you almost recognize. You need to find shelter.

Up ahead, you notice something that shouldn't be there: your childhood home, standing incongruously among the ancient oaks and pines. As you hurry toward it, your feet become heavy, each step requiring enormous effort, as if you're wading through invisible honey.

The front door is already open, swinging gently despite the wind that's now howling around you. Inside, the rooms are all wrong—the kitchen leads into your old classroom, which has a door to your best friend's basement. Someone is calling your name from upstairs, but you can't quite make out who it is.

The storm outside intensifies. Through the windows, you see the rain falling *upward* now, droplets streaming toward the roiling clouds. Lightning cracks, and in its flash, you glimpse a figure standing in the forest, perfectly still among the thrashing trees. They seem to be waiting for you.

You realize you have a choice: go upstairs toward the familiar voice, or go back outside toward the waiting figure.

What do you do?
