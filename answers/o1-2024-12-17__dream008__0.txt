…you feel a sudden rush of panic. You’re seated at your desk, which seems somehow both familiar and strangely distorted. The overhead lights buzz with a dull hum, and the clock on the wall seems to be ticking twice as fast as normal—each second a flurry of motion.

Your boss stands before you with arms crossed, their figure shadowed and elongated as if the florescent lights had melted the world’s geometry. They’re tapping a foot against the thin office carpet in a rhythm that matches your racing heartbeat.

“I need this done by tomorrow morning,” they say, voice echoing around your cubicle as though you were at the bottom of a well. “No excuses.” Their eyes narrow in a way that feels both stern and strangely hollow, like a painted face on a wooden mask.

You turn to your workstation. Your computer’s screen flickers, showing an endless cascade of spreadsheets, documents, and half-completed presentations. You try to focus, but your vision blurs in and out. Outside the window, the cityscape is replaced by an endless library of filing cabinets, each drawer rattling ominously as if stuffed full of papers that might help—or hinder—you.

As you take a shaky breath, you notice that the tools you need—your pen, your phone, your keyboard—are no longer where they should be. In fact, they’re drifting slowly upward, as if gravity has reversed in patches around your desk. You reach up to grab your keyboard, which has floated nearly to the ceiling. The office ceiling tiles have transformed into a mosaic of deadlines and meaningless jargon, arranged in neat rows that seem to mock your efforts.

Your coworkers move around you at impossible angles, as if walking on walls or drifting weightlessly between cubicles. Some give you pitying looks; others are engrossed in their own impossible tasks, their eyes glued to stacks of paper that flutter like frightened birds. You can hear someone typing furiously in the distance, each keystroke echoing like the clack of distant machinery.

As the pressure mounts, the computer monitor suddenly makes a soft chiming sound. You look down, and the spreadsheet cells begin rearranging themselves into a path, a kind of labyrinth made from numbers and tasks. Something compels you to follow it, as if by navigating this coded maze you might find a single clue, a hidden shortcut to finishing the project. You push your chair back, only to find that the floor beneath you has turned into a carpet of Post-it notes. Each note bears a deadline—dates and times that have passed or are soon to come, written in looping, frantic handwriting.

You pick your way through them, trying not to disturb their fragile grid, until you find yourself at the far corner of the office, where a tiny door—previously hidden behind a water cooler—stands ajar. Inside, a soft golden light flickers. You duck through and enter a cramped, secret storeroom lined with shelves of thick, leather-bound reports. There’s an old desk in the corner, and on it sits a quill pen and a single sheet of paper. There’s something comforting about this small, secret space, as if you’ve stumbled upon your own hidden sanctuary.

You lean in, and the paper on the desk reads: *The project is done when you accept it cannot be done.* Confused, you try to think this through. Just then, the quill pen lifts itself into the air and begins scratching lines onto the paper. It’s crossing out the sentence, rewriting something in its place. You watch, transfixed, as the new text emerges: *Find the impossible; finish what you cannot start.*

You step backward, unsure of what that means, and you bump into a shelf. A few books topple down, opening midair and scattering their pages. The pages drift around you, merging into a collage of words and images: flow charts that lead nowhere, a clock face melting like wax, your boss’s eyes superimposed over a night sky.

You realize you’re holding your breath. You let it out, slowly. Something about this place… it’s guiding you. It’s telling you that the notion of an impossible deadline is just a reflection of your own fear. The instructions, the strange rearranging spreadsheets, the drifting tools—everything hints at one truth: this is not a normal task; it’s a puzzle of your own making.

Feeling braver, you return to the main office, stepping through the tiny door. To your surprise, the scene has quieted. Your coworkers are at their desks, their feet firmly on the floor, their movements natural. Your boss stands waiting, but their face is softer now. The clock on the wall ticks at a normal pace. The floating keyboard is back in place.

You sit at your desk and open the documents, this time calmly. The words flow more easily. The charts arrange themselves. The data you need seems to appear with minimal effort. You type swiftly, your hands a blur of confidence and clarity. You realize that the “impossible” nature of this deadline was an illusion, a magnification of your own anxiety. With each keystroke, you feel the tension dissipate.

Eventually, you hit “Save.” The project is as complete as it can be given the time and resources you have. The perfection you feared you couldn’t achieve was never required. Your boss steps over, glances at your screen, and nods—no words are exchanged, but a gentle understanding passes between you.

The dream fades softly now. The hum of the office lights dims, the clock grows faint, and you awaken, feeling oddly at peace.
