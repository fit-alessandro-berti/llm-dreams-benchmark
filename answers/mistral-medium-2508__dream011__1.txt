written in a language you’ve never seen before—fluid, shimmering symbols that seem to shift like liquid mercury when you try to focus on them. The paper itself feels strangely warm, almost alive, as if the ink is pulsing faintly beneath your fingertips.

A whisper slithers through the room, though no one else appears to notice. *"The test isn’t about what you know… but what you’re willing to unlearn."* The proctor—a faceless figure in a robe that ripples like smoke—nods once, and suddenly the questions rearrange themselves into a single, impossible prompt:

**"Describe the shape of the silence between your thoughts. Use only the colors you’ve forgotten."**

Your pencil hovers. The air hums with the weight of something vast and unseen, like the moment before a storm breaks—or a door opens. The other students are scribbling furiously, but their answers dissolve into mist as soon as they’re written. One by one, their desks begin to float upward, drifting toward a ceiling that isn’t there anymore. The room is expanding, or perhaps *you* are shrinking—

Then you realize: the exam isn’t on the paper. It’s in the way your breath catches when you glance at the empty chair beside you, the one that *wasn’t* there a second ago. The chair is waiting. Not for an answer, but for a choice.

Do you:
1. **Write your name in the margin—except the letters spell something else entirely when you look back.**
2. **Stand up and walk to the front of the room, where the proctor’s robe has fallen open to reveal a staircase descending into dark.**
3. **Close your eyes and press your palm to the page, letting the ink seep into your skin like a tattoo of a question you’ll spend the rest of your life answering.**
4. **Whisper the first word that comes to mind—and watch as the room rearranges itself around the sound.**

(The dream is testing you. But not the way you think.)
