You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you realize your computer has turned into a typewriter from the 1920s, with keys that stick like glue and ink that writes in invisible cursive. Panic sets in as your boss morphs into a giant hourglass, sand pouring from their sleeves onto your desk, burying your notes in glittering dunes.

You hammer at the keys anyway, but each stroke summons a flock of origami birds that flap around the room, stealing your coffee and rewriting your code into haikus about procrastination. The deadline clock on the wall sprouts legs and starts sprinting away, laughing maniacally. Colleagues pop out of vending machines like jack-in-the-boxes, chanting "Overtime! Overtime!" while handing you rubber chickens instead of tools.

Desperate, you dive into the sand to retrieve your phone, but it rings with your own voice yelling, "Wake up! You're late for the dream!" The office warps into a carousel, spinning you faster and faster until everything blurs into colors, and you jolt awake, heart pounding, just as the project deadline whispers "April Fools" in your ear.
