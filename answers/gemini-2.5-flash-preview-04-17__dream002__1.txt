...you feel a storm approaching and the air grows heavy and electric. The cheerful green leaves on the trees suddenly look flat and dark, and the sky overhead isn't just grey – it's swirling with shades of bruised purple and sickly green. A low groan starts in the distance, growing quickly into a roar as the wind sweeps through the forest like an invisible hand, bending the trees impossibly low, their branches scraping the ground with a sound like dry claws. Tiny sparks dance in the air around you, clinging to the bark of the trees and making the shadows leap. You feel a primal urge to run, but your feet are slow, heavy, almost stuck in the deepening twilight. The scent of wet earth and ozone fills your lungs, sharp and metallic. Then, the first raindrop hits your cheek – not water, but a single, cold, intensely *bright* point of light that dissolves on your skin, leaving a tingle that buzzes all the way to your teeth. You look up just as the sky tears open not with lightning, but with a cascade of silent, shimmering stars that fall like rain towards the trembling earth.
