...adapt to survive. Gone are the gentle hum of air conditioners, the subtle flicker of streetlights, and the quiet certainty that a bus or train would carry you wherever you wished. Instead, you find yourself in what appears to be a small village on the outskirts of a sprawling farmland. The sun is barely above the horizon, and the sky’s gentle pink hue dances across wooden rooftops and fields of grain. The air is crisp, scented faintly of hay and smoke. A few villagers trudge along a dirt path, carrying heavy bundles of sticks or simple clay pots. Their clothes look hand-stitched and worn, their calloused hands and weathered faces revealing lives of hard labor.

You quickly realize you don’t belong here. There is no electricity, no phones, no cars. Everything is handmade—tools of wrought iron and bone, baskets of woven reed, huts of straw and timber. Wherever, and whenever, you are, you’ve somehow landed in a world that predates your own familiar comforts by centuries.

A growl in your stomach reminds you that you have no food, no money, and no knowledge of this era’s customs. Though your modern clothes stand out, no one yet pays you much attention. Perhaps strangers wandering into town are rare but not impossible. Still, you know it’s only a matter of time before people begin to question your oddities. 

Your first necessity is simple: find a way to eat. Approaching a stand of wooden carts, you see a man carving turnips and tossing them into a woven crate. Another woman sits nearby, shelling peas into a wooden bowl. There’s a rhythmic calm to these chores, as if the day’s survival depends on steady, patient labor. Without your usual sources—no wallet, no digital bank to fall back on—you must barter or work for food. It strikes you that you don’t even know the local language. How will you communicate?

Trying to appear harmless and friendly, you approach the turnip-carver. He squints up at you. His clothes—sturdy leather boots, a coarse linen tunic, and a vest of thick wool—suggest that he might be a farmer of some kind. He says something you don’t understand, his voice low and curious. You raise your hands, shaking your head gently, and point to yourself, trying to convey that you’re lost. He scratches his beard, then breaks a small chunk off one of the raw turnips. He holds it out, as if testing your intentions.

You accept it with a grateful nod. The turnip is bitter and earthy, but it’s nourishment. With a mouth half-full, you try to pantomime work—miming digging, or carrying loads of straw, in hopes he’ll understand that you’re willing to earn your keep. The farmer’s eyes narrow as he attempts to decipher your gestures. After a pause, he jerks a thumb over his shoulder, gesturing toward a nearby patch of overgrown weeds. He hands you a crude sickle and makes a sweeping motion, evidently indicating that if you help clear the brush, you’ll be worthy of another turnip—or something more substantial.

You set to the task, and as you work, you listen. You listen to the chatter of the villagers, trying to pick out repeated sounds or words. You pay attention to the tools, the buildings, the fields. Every detail you take in might help you understand this place. The sun climbs higher, and sweat beads on your forehead as you cut away tough stalks and pull knotted roots from the dry soil.

Hours pass, and though your back aches and your modern clothes are stained, you feel a surprising sense of purpose. You’re learning the rhythm of another time, another life. When you return to the farmer, he offers you a small loaf of coarse bread and a nod—simple gratitude, but it feels like a feast.

As you chew your meal, a young girl approaches and tugs on the farmer’s sleeve. She points at you, then utters a series of soft syllables that might be your first clue to learning their language. The farmer repeats the words more slowly, as if introducing you to a name. He points at you and smiles kindly before returning to his work.

In the fading light, you realize your survival here will depend not only on labor but on forging connections, learning the language, and proving your worth. As the villagers retire to their huts, and smoke rises from thatched roofs, you know that tomorrow you must find a more permanent shelter and learn to communicate. You are a traveler in time, and now your journey is only beginning.
