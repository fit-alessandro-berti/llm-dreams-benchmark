not written in any language you recognize. The letters seem to shift and morph, as if alive, and the paper emits a faint glow. Panic begins to settle in, but then you notice something strange: the answers to the questions seem to appear fleetingly in the air around you, like whispers of light. You reach for them, but they dissolve as quickly as they manifest.

Suddenly, the professor walks in. They are not who you expected—they have the face of your childhood self but the aura of immeasurable wisdom. They look at you knowingly and say, “The real test isn’t on the paper. It’s within you.”

Confused, you look down at your hands and realize they've started to write on their own, scribbling answers in glowing ink. The words form questions instead of answers: *"What is your truest passion?" "Who have you become?" "What are you willing to lose?"*

The classroom begins to transform. The walls melt away into a vast, open landscape of endless pathways, each one illuminated by a different hue of light. The professor gestures for you to choose a path.

Which path do you take?
