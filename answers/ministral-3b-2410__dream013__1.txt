You begin to notice that the walls surrounding you are no longer the same. Some are made of glass, letting you see into other parts of the maze, while others are made of stone, giving the illusion of solidity. A faint humming sound fills the air, and you realize it's coming from the puzzles themselves.

You reach a crossroads, and there are four puzzles laid out before you: a riddle, a code, a mirror maze, and a musical instrument. Each one glows softly with an otherworldly light. You take a deep breath and start with the riddle.

The riddle reads: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

You think for a moment before recalling a story from childhood about the wind. You respond, "Echo." The riddle's light turns green, and a path opens up, leading you deeper into the maze.

As you proceed, you encounter a locked door. The handle is a complex code. You recall the code from a dream you had last night - a sequence of numbers and symbols. You input the code, and the door unlocks, revealing a room filled with musical notes. You pick up a drum and start playing, and the notes resonate through the maze, unlocking more paths and revealing hidden puzzles.

After solving the musical puzzle, you find yourself in a vast room with a massive mirror. The mirror reflects your image, but with slight distortions. You realize you're standing in a reflection of your own face from a previous dream. You carefully manipulate the distortions, shifting your reflection to match a path you saw in your dream.

Finally, you reach the heart of the maze, a crystal orb pulsating with energy. As you approach, the orb begins to spin, and a voice echoes through your mind, "You've reached the end of the maze. Your path is now clear. But remember, the maze is never truly finished. It waits for you to return."

You wake up, the dream fading away, but the sense of accomplishment lingers. You know that the maze is still there, waiting for you, its puzzles and challenges just out of reach. And you know that one day, you'll return to explore it all again.
