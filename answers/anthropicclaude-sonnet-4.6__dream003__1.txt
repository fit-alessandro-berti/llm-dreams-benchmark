...symbols etched into its surface, shimmering faintly as if lit from within. The patterns seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them — spirals becoming constellations, constellations becoming faces, faces becoming maps of places you almost recognize.

The box is warm. Not uncomfortably so. More like a hand that has been held.

You run your fingers along the edge and realize the lock isn't a lock at all — it's a question, formed in a language you somehow *almost* speak. The symbols rearrange themselves slowly, patiently, the way a teacher waits.

You lean closer.

The question reads: *"What are you willing to put down?"*

Around you, the dream-space responds. Objects begin materializing — your worries, lined up like stones. Your grudges, heavy and familiar in your hands. The version of yourself you perform for others, standing nearby like a coat on a hook.

You don't overthink it. You simply set something down. You're not even sure what. But the moment it leaves your hands, it makes a sound like a bell struck underwater.

And the box...

...opens.

Inside is not treasure. Not light. Not an answer.

Inside is *more space than the box could possibly hold* — a room, a sky, a threshold — and standing at the edge of it, someone who looks exactly like you, but rested.

They smile.

*"You took longer than usual,"* they say.

*"This happens every night,"* you realize suddenly.

*"Yes,"* they say. *"And every night you remember something different."*

They hand you something small and warm. You look down.

It is exactly what you needed, though you couldn't have named it before this moment.

You close your fingers around it.

You wake up.

It's still in your hand.

You just can't quite see it yet.
