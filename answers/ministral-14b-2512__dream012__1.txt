**The Dream Continues:**

The wind howls like a living thing, tearing at the sails with jagged teeth. Salt spray stings your face as you grip the wheel, your knuckles white beneath the strain. The ship groans beneath you—timbers creaking like old bones, the deck slick with rain and something darker. The storm has no mercy, and neither do the waves, which rise like monstrous hands, ready to drag you under.

Your first mate, a grizzled woman with a scar across her cheek, shouts over the gale: *"Captain! The starboard rigging’s snapped! We’re losing the mainsail!"* You nod, your jaw set. There’s no time for fear—only action. You bark orders, your voice cutting through the chaos like a blade:

*"Helm hard to port! All hands to the starboard lines—secure what we can before the next swell takes us!"*

The crew moves like a well-oiled machine, though their faces are pale with exhaustion. A young cabin boy—no older than sixteen—slips on the deck, his fingers scrabbling for purchase. You see him go down, hear the sickening *thud* as his head strikes the rail. For a heartbeat, the world stills. Then you’re there, hauling him up, your hands rough but sure. *"You good, lad?"* His eyes are wide, but he nods, teeth chattering.

*"Aye, Captain."*

The ship lurches violently, throwing you against the wheel. The compass spins wildly, its needle dancing between north and something *wrong*—a direction that doesn’t exist on any map. Your stomach twists. This isn’t just a storm. It’s a *warning*.

Then you see it.

A light.

Not the flickering glow of a distant ship, but something older, something *alive*. It pulses beneath the waves, a sickly green-blue, like bioluminescent coral—but vast, *immense*, as if the sea itself is breathing. The water around it churns unnaturally, as though the ocean is recoiling from whatever lies beneath.

*"There!"* your first mate points, her voice tight. *"What in the hells is that?"*

You don’t answer. You’re already moving, your boots pounding toward the crow’s nest. The lookout—a wild-eyed man with a beard braided with sea glass—is clinging to the rigging, his face ashen.

*"Captain… it’s not just the storm. The water’s… changing. The fish are fleeing. The birds—"* He swallows. *"They’re flying *away* from us."*

A deep, resonant *hum* vibrates through the deck, shaking the timbers. The ship groans louder, as if something vast has just *shifted* beneath it.

Then the waves part.

Not like a ship cutting through them—like something *pulling* them apart. A gap yawns in the sea, dark and endless, and from its depths rises a shape. Not a ship. Not a beast. Something *between*—a towering, skeletal structure of blackened wood and barnacled metal, its edges jagged like broken teeth. It doesn’t float. It *sinks*, dragging the water down with it, as if the ocean itself is being *drained* toward it.

And at its center—

A door.

Not of wood or iron, but of something *wrong*, veined with that same sickly light. It’s open. Just a crack. And from that crack comes a sound like a thousand voices whispering in a language that makes your teeth ache.

Your first mate grabs your arm. *"Captain, we run. Now."*

But you don’t move. Because you *know*.

This isn’t the first time you’ve seen it.

You’ve dreamed of this door before. In the dead of night, when the ship was still and the sea was quiet. You’ve seen it in the fog, half-glimpsed from the deck, its light calling to something deep inside you.

And now it’s here.

The choice is yours.

**Do you:**
- **Order the crew to flee, even if it means abandoning the ship?** (The storm rages, but the thing in the water is worse.)
- **Steer the ship *toward* the door?** (Something in your chest pulls you closer, like a drowning man to the surface.)
- **Try to destroy the door?** (You grab a harpoon, your hands steady despite the terror. If it’s a threat, it won’t be the first you’ve faced.)
- **Something else?** (The dream is yours—where does it lead?)

*(Choose, Captain. The storm waits for no one.)*
