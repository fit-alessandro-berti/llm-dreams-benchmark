The strangers stood at the edge of a fog-kissed courtyard, their purpose urgent yet gentle. One offered a tile beneath your palm, etched with a single word: *Home*. Beneath it pulsed a flicker of light, sharp yet warm, as if etched by your own heartbeat. They tilted their heads, listening to the distant hum of the city dissolve into the rustle of leaves, revealing a path lined with trees taller than your bones, their branches cradling a tiny, cradle-shaped stone shaped like a heart. A voice, soft as wind through pages, whispered, *"Remember what you carried—your reflection."* With a soft click of their wrist, the flowers bloomed, revealing a mirror within—the one in the stranger’s left eye, which now felt woven into your own. There, amidst the chaos, you realized your compass was always missing. The way forward wasn’t a map, but the memory within yourself. As the light wrapped around you, the strangers vanished, leaving only the feeling: *You belong here.* The city had always been its breath. 

Thus concluded.
