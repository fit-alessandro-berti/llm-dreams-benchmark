You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to feel the familiar weight of their attention pressing down. The spotlight is warm, the silence is thick, and you open your mouth to speak...

...but instead of human faces, the crowd揭示 themselves to be an infinite sea of **giant pocket watches**. Each one has a single, luminous eye where the watch face should be, and all those eyes are fixed on you. They don't tick – they pulse, like slow, deliberate heartbeats, synchronized in a rhythm that vibrates through the stage floor. You understand, deep in the dream-logic of your mind, that they aren't waiting for words. They are waiting for **time itself**.

You clear your throat, but the sound comes out metallic, like a cog grinding into place. You try to remember the speech you prepared, about innovation or connection or the future, but the words feel dry and insubstantial, like ash on your tongue. Instead, you find yourself speaking a different truth:

*"You pulse,"* you say, and your voice echoes unnaturally loud. *"You mark seconds, minutes, hours... but what do you really measure?"*

The watches lean in slightly, their luminous eyes narrowing. The pulsing rhythm quickens, a collective thrum of anticipation. You feel a strange kinship with them, a shared burden of relentless progression.

*"You measure loss,"* you continue, the words flowing now, not rehearsed, but dredged from some deep, dream-well. *"You count the moments between heartbeats, the space between breaths, the distance between here and gone. You are monuments to what escapes us."*

A low hum rises from the watches, not disapproving, but acknowledging. Their hands – long, skeletal pointers – begin to move. Not forwards, but erratically, spinning backwards in jerky bursts, jumping forward, some stopping dead. The luminous eyes flicker, showing not numbers, but fleeting images: a child's laugh dissolved into static, a familiar face blurred and indistinct, a field of wheat bending in an impossible wind.

*"But what if..."* you pause, feeling a surge of unexpected courage, *"...what if you didn't have to? What if now is enough?"*

As you say this, you raise your hand, not to gesture, but as if to hold something fragile. In your palm, a tiny, perfect pocket watch materializes. It ticks, but its tick is soft, irregular, almost musical. You hold it out towards the vast crowd.

For a breathless moment, the entire auditorium hangs in the balance. The watches stop their chaotic spinning. Their eyes fix on the tiny timepiece in your hand. The pulsing rhythm softens, becoming a gentle, questioning flutter.

Then, the tiny watch in your palm dissolves. Not into smoke, but into a flock of tiny, iridescent dragonflies that swirl upwards, filling the spotlight with shimmering wings. They spiral out towards the audience, and as they brush against the luminous watch-eyes, each touched eye dims, turning into a simple, polished silver surface – blank, reflective, and still. One by one, across the vast sea, the watches cease their relentless counting, becoming mirrors.

You stand bathed in the soft light of the dragonflies, watching the transformation. The silence now isn't expectant; it's peaceful, restful. You look out at the countless mirrors, expecting to see your own reflection multiplied infinitely. But instead, each mirror shows only the empty space where a watch-eye had been, reflecting only the quiet, timeless stage lights.

You open your mouth to speak again, but find you have no more words. There's nothing left to say. You simply stand there, holding the silence, as the dream gently dissolves into the grey light of morning, the feel of smooth, cool stage wood still lingering on your fingertips.
