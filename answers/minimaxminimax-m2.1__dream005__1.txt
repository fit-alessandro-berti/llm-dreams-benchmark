You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and find yourself drifting between conversations you can't quite follow. The room seems to shift and change—now it's a ballroom with mirrored walls, now a backyard barbecue, now an endless hallway lined with doors that all lead back to the same crowded space.

Each group you approach feels almost familiar, like memories of people you've met but can't quite place. They're engaged in animated discussions about topics that seem crucial, but whenever you strain to hear what they're saying, the words dissolve into a murmur like television static. Someone laughs at something you didn't say. Someone else looks at you with recognition, but when you smile back, they turn away as if they've mistaken you for someone else.

You catch glimpses of your familiar face across the room—a flash of red, a particular way of holding a drink—but by the time you navigate through the crowd, they've dissolved into the mass of strangers. You start to wonder if they were ever really there at all, or if you only imagined knowing someone in this sea of unknowns.

The dream tugs at something deeper: that feeling of belonging everywhere and nowhere, of searching for connection in spaces that keep reshaping themselves just when you think you've found solid ground.
