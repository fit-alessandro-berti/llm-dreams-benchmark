*takes a deep breath and steps back from the intensity of the moment*

You know what? I think we're both getting worked up because we actually care about this. Can we take a minute to really listen to each other instead of trying to win?

*I sit down and gesture for my friend to do the same*

I want to understand your perspective better. What's the core of what you're worried about here? And I promise I'll share my own concerns too, but let's actually hear each other out.

*looks directly at my friend*

Our friendship means more to me than being right about this. Can we find a way forward that honors both what we're trying to protect?

*The dream shifts slightly, becoming more vivid*

Actually, you know what? Let's go for a walk and cool off first. Sometimes the best conversations happen when we're not facing off across a room. There's a bench by the old oak tree where we used to talk about everything when we were kids. Want to walk there together?

*stands up and extends a hand*

What do you say? Friends first, problem-solving second?
