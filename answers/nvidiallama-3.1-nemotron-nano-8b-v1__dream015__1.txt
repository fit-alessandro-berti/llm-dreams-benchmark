As I stumbled out of the ruins of the old records office, my eyes scanning the desolate horizon, a task suddenly settled on my mind. I had sometime brought my makeshift shelter, scavenging banks to stockpile supplies. But today felt the critical moment. As I observed the storm approaching, my mind racing with wondering: Can I hold onto everything? Could I learn how to overwhelm the bandits traipsing the city or block him from prying my treasures? 

The river flashed with the howls of the creatures that ruled the slits of my mind. A scarred 'secrets room' fumbled for hidden keys, but a new threat loomed—the razor-sharp 'snipers' clinging to the cliff's edge. Each threat defined a choice: only supplies might save me from hunger, but no safety from conflict. 

Whispers filled the void: "Do I retreat to the shelter and gamble all for a refuge, or press the strain even more to escape?" 

The city's fragile balance remained tenuous. Batmen read books during raids. And my heart stirred: *Can I become a hero, even by every measure, in this endless fall*? I didn't know. But one thing was clear—no gonna survive this without making decisions right now.
