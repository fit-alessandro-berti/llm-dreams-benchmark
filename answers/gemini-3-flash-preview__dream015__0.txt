The sky is the color of a bruised plum, heavy with clouds that never rain. I can taste the copper of old rust on the wind and hear the rhythmic *clack-clack-clack* of a loose piece of corrugated metal banging against a hollowed-out skyscraper. My boots crunch over a carpet of shattered glass and dry bones.

Despite the hardships, I decide to **stop scavenging for food and instead start scavenging for ghosts.**

I ignore the rusted cans of peaches and the canisters of filtered water. Instead, I duck into the ruins of an old elementary school. I’m looking for things that have no value in this dying world: a blue crayon, a tattered photograph of a birthday party, a music box that only plays three notes before it stutters.

I carry these treasures to the highest point in the city—the skeleton of a radio tower that stabs upward into the grey haze. I don’t use the tower to broadcast a distress signal; there is no one left to answer. Instead, I begin to tie the objects to the girders with strips of faded ribbon. 

As the wind picks up, the dream shifts. The tower doesn't just hold the objects; it begins to breathe through them. The blue crayon streaks the sky, turning the bruised clouds into a vibrant sapphire. The three notes from the broken music box stretch and multiply, layering into a symphony that drowns out the howling wind. 

I stand at the edge of the rusted platform, looking out over the wasteland. For a moment, the grey dunes of ash transform. Where there was dust, there is now a shimmering sea of tall grass. Where there were ruins, there are flickering lights of windows coming home.

I realize then that I am not just surviving; I am remembering the world back into existence. I reach into my pocket and find one last item: a silver key that belongs to no door. I hold it up to the sun—a pale, white disc behind the smog—and the key begins to glow.

Just as the light becomes blinding, the wind drops to a dead silence. The world feels soft, like it’s made of velvet and static. I close my eyes in the dream, knowing that when I open them, the world will either be whole again, or I will finally be awake.
