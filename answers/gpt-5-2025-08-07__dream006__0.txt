…speak, and your voice forgets it’s a voice. It decides to be weather instead.

A warm wind comes out of you. It slips past the microphone and lifts the velvet curtain like a tide lifting a beach towel. The first rows blink; their faces are lanterns with moths tapping the glass. You glance at your notes and discover they’re blank except for a faint watermark of your own hand, as if you’ve already touched every word you meant to say.

Someone coughs. The cough is a little bell that calls tiny birds out of your mouth. They are not embarrassed to be your sentences. They wheel under the stage lights, flaring punctuation in the air—commas perch on the rigging, a question mark tilts its head at the balcony. You worry, briefly, about being ridiculous, about the old dream of standing here in nothing but your bare skin, but when you look down you’re wearing your grandfather’s jacket, the one with the too-long sleeves, and instead of buttons it has small clocks. Each clock is set to a time you loved: morning light on kitchen tiles, the hour a stranger returned your lost glove, a minute in late summer when a storm held its breath.

The microphone hums like a bee. You reach to steady it and feel a pulse. It’s warm, alive; it’s not a microphone at all but a rib in the cage you forgot you were inside. The auditorium inhales. You meet the audience’s eyes and they shift the way fields do at dusk, each person becoming someone you almost recognize—your fourth-grade teacher with a bird’s nest on her shoulder, a child you might one day know signing hello with sticky fingers, your own reflection at sixteen refusing to clap for anything that wasn’t true. They are waiting, but not for facts. They are waiting for warmth like plants turning their faces toward a window.

You let your birds settle. You let the warm wind become quiet. When the silence lands, it feels like stepping into a lake at night and finding the water holds you. You say the first word you ever learned, the one that barely counts as a word at all. Hello. It drops into the crowd and ripples out, and the ripples become lines on a map, and the aisles turn into rivers you somehow knew were there.

Seats soften into moss. Programs unfurl into ferns. Somewhere near the back a man in a suit removes his hat and moths pour from it in a polite, golden stream; they collect around your clocks and set all the hands to the same hour. The ceiling cracks along a seam you’ve never noticed and the sky peers in, blue and impossible, as if the theater’s roof were just a small misunderstanding between you and what’s above.

You walk away from the lectern and your shoes turn into fish that don’t mind carrying you. The stage flexes underfoot like a low tide. You stop at the edge and look out, and the people are so quiet they glow. You tell them the story without telling it—the one about how every time you were certain you would be dropped, something invisible cupped you instead. You show them your empty hands and somehow they see them full of mirrors, and in each mirror there’s a room where a younger version of you is waiting to be found and forgiven.

A woman in the second row stands, then another, then another, and the sound that rises is not applause but rain on a metal roof. It washes the chalky lines from the stage, the taped X that said Stand Here, the water stains of other speeches. The rain runs down the aisles into the rivers and the rivers lift tiny paper boats—your birds have folded themselves neatly, considerate as always. People reach out and guide the boats with their fingertips, and you realize the speech has been happening all along, outside of words, in the way everyone holds something small and lets it pass unharmed.

You bow. They bow back. The clocks on your jacket stop pretending to matter. The theater takes one more deep breath and exhales you like a dandelion seed. You drift up, not far, just enough to see the rows of heads as a topography: hills of listening, valleys of grief, plateaus of relief. Someone opens the exit door and beyond it is not a hallway but a meadow lit with fireflies that have been practicing this message for a very long time: You’re here. You’re here. You’re here.

You step toward it, and the edge of the dream meets the edge of the bed. You wake with the taste of rain on your tongue and a single feather where your next sentence ought to be.
