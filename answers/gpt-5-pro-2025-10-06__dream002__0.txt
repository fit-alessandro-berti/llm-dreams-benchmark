and the air tightens as if someone has pulled a drawstring around the forest. Birds go quiet mid-syllable. The leaves turn their pale undersides, trembling, and the light dims to the color of old coins. The smell arrives first—wet stone, crushed herbs, a metallic tang like the taste of your own mouth when you’ve said something important and forgotten what it was.

Wind lifts your hair and threads through the pines with a harpist’s impatience. In the distance, thunder tests the edge of its voice. The path at your feet dissolves into mirrored puddles that reflect a sky you don’t recognize: not the one above, but another one, older, where clouds move like whales and lightning is the slow blink of a patient eye.

You think to run for shelter, but there is no shelter; the trees are too thin and too honest. A hollow trunk beckons like a throat and you nearly step into it, but something about the storm feels personal, as if it has traveled a long way and learned your name and would be offended if you hid.

The first drops are huge and warm, then a cold needle-threading rain follows. It stitches the air, stitches your clothes to your skin, stitches your breath to the rhythm of the thunder. In a flash of white, you see for an instant that every raindrop contains a tiny room. Some hold teacups, some hold single chairs, some hold closed doors with numbers you cannot quite read. The storm is making a house out of everything.

Wind pushes you into a clearing you don’t remember walking toward. The grass there is flattened into concentric circles, as if something enormous once curled up and slept. You stand at the center and lift your hands without meaning to. The wind wraps your wrists with invisible twine. Lightning answers, and for a moment the woods are a library of bone—every trunk, every root, illuminated like a sentence you have almost remembered.

The thunder speaks, not in words but in pressure. It presses the thought into you anyway: Look.

You look. The path behind you is gone, swallowed by a river that was a dry ravine moments ago. The water moves like a sheet being pulled off a familiar shape. You realize the storm has been carrying something toward you, and now, having arrived, it lays it down at your feet.

It is a door.

Not attached to anything, just a tall green door with peeling paint, standing upright in the clearing as if the frame around it were made of air. The knob is a small stone. The wind leans on it with you, and it opens easily.

Beyond is not a room, because you are dreaming and doors open onto what is loved or feared. Beyond is a hallway lined with mirrors. The storm remains outside like an attentive dog, rain pattering politely at the threshold.

Inside, the mirrors are not of glass but of water. They curve and sway, holding images that quiver with every thunderclap. You pass one where you are a child, damp hair stuck to your forehead, holding a jar of fireflies that flicker like handwriting. Another where you are older, sitting at a window, the storm outside the same storm, your face the same face and not. In one, your hands are covered in blue paint. In another, in soil.

A mirror near the end holds a forest, this forest, but empty of you, the clearing unoccupied, the rain falling on your absence. In that one, the storm moves through without a witness. You are overcome with a shiver of gratitude for having been chosen, or for having chosen to stand where you are standing.

There is one last mirror, small as a pocket. When you lift it, it is cool and heavy, and it does not show your face at all. It shows a mouth of black sky and teeth of bright lightning and you understand: the storm you felt approaching was not above you; it was behind your ribs. It has been knocking, asking to be let out in a place wide enough to hold it.

So you take a breath that reaches all the way to your heels. You step back through the door, into the clearing, and you open your chest in the way only dreams allow—you part a seam that was always there, a zipper of light. Wind pours through you, not harming but hurrying, carrying off dust, old leaves, words you swallowed, the grit in your joints. Rain washes the space behind your sternum, and the ache you thought was bone-deep is simply weather passing.

Thunder laughs, sloppy and delighted. The trees sway and bow in a choreography they’ve practiced for centuries. The door behind you closes of its own accord and falls gently to the grass, where it sinks as if into soft clay until only the stone knob remains like an odd mushroom.

Gradually, the rain gentles. Drops separate and magnify the world on their way to the ground. Each one bursts with a small, soft sigh. The storm loosens its grip, threads untying from your wrists, ropes of wind going slack, the air undoing its own knots.

When the cloud-bellies lift, the colors return with a clarity that makes you blink. The forest smells rinsed and awake. Tiny shocks of color announce themselves—orange fungi like tiny umbrellas, a slick of rainbow oil on a puddle where a dragonfly has decided to be a helicopter. A deer steps onto the edge of the clearing and regards you with the kind of patience that feels like understanding. Its antlers are hung with raindrops that tinkle faintly, a crown of glass.

You move your hand to your chest without thinking and find there, not a wound, not a scar, but the feeling of air moving freely in a place that was once cramped. If you press, you can feel the echo of thunder like a distant drum you can walk to whenever you wish.

The path reappears as if it had always been there, just shy. You take the first step and the ground holds you. Your wet shoes squeak. Above, the last of the storm unravels into cloud-lace, and a slit of blue shows through, the exact color of a promise you wrote to yourself and tucked away.

As you walk on, the forest resumes its conversations. A bird finishes the syllable it left hanging. Somewhere, quietly, the door you swallowed clicks shut behind your ribs, not to imprison, but to keep safe. You know you can open it again. You know you will.

And as the trees thin and the path brightens, you realize that some part of you is clean in a way that only rain can accomplish. You are lighter. You are not out of the storm so much as the storm is now part of your weather, no longer a threat but a climate you can carry without drowning.

You walk until the forest empties into a sunlit meadow that smells of warm straw. The edges of the dream fuzz like something loved and well-used. You feel the weight of your body returning to you like a blanket. Somewhere, a drip falls in the quiet house of your skull and you turn toward it, smiling, already forgetting the exact shape of the door, already knowing where to find it again.
