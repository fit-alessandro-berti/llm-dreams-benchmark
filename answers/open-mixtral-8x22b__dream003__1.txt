symbols etched into the surface. Curiosity piqued, you decide to take the box to a nearby antique shop for further examination. The elderly shopkeeper, a wise old man with a twinkle in his eye, takes one look at the box and tells you that it belongs to a long-lost civilization known for their advanced knowledge of the cosmos.

He leads you to a dusty corner of his shop, where he reveals an ancient tome filled with cryptic codes and celestial maps. Together, you spend hours deciphering the codes and aligning the box's patterns with the maps, slowly unlocking the secrets of the universe.

Just as you're about to give up, a sudden realization dawns on you. You align the box with the current position of the stars and moon, and with a satisfying click, the lock opens. Inside, you find a shimmering crystal orb, pulsating with an otherworldly energy.

The shopkeeper explains that the orb is a repository of ancient wisdom, containing the knowledge of the cosmos. As you hold it in your hands, you feel a profound connection to the universe, and a deep sense of peace washes over you. You've unlocked more than just a box, you've unlocked the mysteries of the cosmos.
