...and the air grows heavy and electric, smelling strongly of ozone and damp earth.

The gentle green canopy above me is instantly replaced by a swirling, bruise-purple sky. The wind hits me like a physical shove, whipping the branches of the ancient pines into frantic, bony gestures. The first few drops of rain are enormous, cold splashes that feel less like water and more like tiny hammers striking my skin.

I instinctively look for shelter, but as I turn, the forest floor dissolves beneath a rushing sound that isn't wind—it's fast-moving water. A flash of lightning—so close it’s silent—illuminates the scene, and I realize the storm isn't just above me; it's engulfing me. The trees begin to lean inward, their bark peeling away in strips that drift through the air like gray feathers.

I try to run, but my legs feel like lead, sinking into the softening ground. The world becomes a symphony of panicked noise: the shriek of the wind, the low, deep-chest rumble of thunder, and the sudden, loud *crack* of splintering wood nearby.

But just as I brace myself for the downpour, the noise stops.

Everything holds its breath. The rain freezes in mid-air, suspended as millions of glistening, perfect droplets.

The storm hasn't gone away; it has simply shifted its intention.

A single, colossal bolt of green lightning—a color I have never seen in nature, fluorescent and impossibly bright—strikes the ground directly in front of me.

Instead of fire or destruction, the bolt produces a wave of soundless light. This light expands rapidly, washing over the purple sky, the suspended rain, and the grasping trees. As it touches them, everything changes color.

The sky turns a deep, saturated indigo, patterned with gold veins like marble. The trees are no longer wood; they are crystalline structures, vibrating slightly and chiming with a low hum. The frozen raindrops become glittering rubies and emeralds, forming an arched, impossible dome above my head.

The overwhelming fear is replaced by a profound, cold sense of awe. I am standing at the center of a brilliant, soundless kaleidoscope.

I look down at my hands. They are glowing with the same eerie green light that struck the ground. I realize I am not being threatened by the storm; **I have become the source of its light.** The dream demands that I move, not *away* from the storm, but deeper *into* the crystallized forest that I have just created.

I take a step, and the ground beneath my glowing foot chimes, releasing a ripple of pure, melodic sound that echoes through the jeweled trees. I am walking on music, the only living, warm thing in a world of silent, magnificent glass. The forest waits for me to play the next note.
