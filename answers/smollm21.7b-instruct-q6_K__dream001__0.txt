search for it, but every street leads you astray, as if some invisible force is guiding you away from your destination. You run into pedestrians, but they all seem lost too, their faces obscured by confused expressions. Then suddenly, a small, handwritten sign catches your eye - "Bridgeview Tower, Suite 830". The location seems clear, and with renewed hope, you navigate through the city streets and towards the building marked on your map. You push open the door to an unfamiliar room filled with colleagues from previous years of school. Your meeting is set for just a few minutes now. With all parties accounted for and everything in place, you take your seat in anticipation of sharing some news which will change both your lives for the better.
