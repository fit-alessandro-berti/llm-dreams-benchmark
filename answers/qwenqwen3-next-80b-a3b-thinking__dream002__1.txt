The air growth thick and heavy, pressing against your skin like warm velvet. Just moments ago, the forest was dappled in golden light, birds singing in the canopy. Now, the sky *bruises*â€”not cloud, but a deep, swirling violet-black that swallows the horizon. The breeze turns cold, then stings. Itâ€™s not windâ€”itâ€™s the forest holding its breath.

Thenâ€”**impact**. Not thunder, but a sound like a giantâ€™s fist cracking the world open. Lightning doesnâ€™t flicker; it *explodes*, splitting the sky into jagged veins of pure white. The trees flex like living things, roots straining against the earth. Rain doesnâ€™t fallâ€”it *hurtsles*, stinging your cheeks like tiny ice needles. You stumble, palms skimming slick bark, and gasp. The scent of ozone and damp earth floods your lungs.  

*Itâ€™s alive.* Itâ€™s not just weatherâ€”itâ€™s something *watching*. A presence older than the trees, humming in the drumming rain. Every drop feels like a whisper: *"Do you remember what you are?"*  

For a heartbeat, fear claws at your throat. You want to run. But then you *stop*.  
You press your bare feet into the mud, feel the tremor of the earth beneath you. You tilt your head back, welcoming the rain. And it changes. The stinging drops soften into liquid light. The thunder becomes a deep, resonant song in your bones. The lightning doesnâ€™t burnâ€”it *awakens*. It flows up your spine, pooling in your chest like warmth.  

You stand tall. The storm isnâ€™t coming *for* you. Itâ€™s coming *through* you. The trees sway not in fear, but in rhythm. The rain isnâ€™t fallingâ€”itâ€™s rising from the roots, swirling around you in a dance of silver. You realize: *this is the forest dreaming*. And youâ€™re part of its dream.  

Then, as quickly as it began, the violence eases. The violet sky softens to dawn-pink. Birdsong returns, truer and brighter than before. The air smells of petrichor and wild honey. You turnâ€”your shoes are dry, your clothes crackling with static, but your skin thrums with something new. A deep, quiet ache of understanding. The forest has given you a gift: the storm wasnâ€™t destruction. It was *(re)creation*.  

And for the first time, you remember how to sing.  

*(The dream fades, but the warmth remains in your palms.)* ðŸŒ²âœ¨
