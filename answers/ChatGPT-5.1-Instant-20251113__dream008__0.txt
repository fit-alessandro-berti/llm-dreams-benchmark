…take a breath, trying to steady yourself, but the office lights begin to flicker in a way they never have before. Your keyboard seems farther away than it should be, like the desk is stretching. Your boss taps their foot impatiently, but when you look up, their face is strangely unreadable, as if made of blurred brushstrokes.

You reach for the project folder, but when you open it, the pages inside are blank—except for a faint, moving shimmer, like ink deciding whether it wants to exist. The deadline clock on the wall begins counting down far too quickly, numbers spinning as though time itself is panicking.

Then you notice something even stranger: the hum of the office isn’t the usual mechanical buzz. It’s… music. A soft, distant melody that seems to be coming from the vents. Curiosity pulls you from your panic. You step closer to one of the vents, and as the music grows clearer, the metal grating dissolves like sand. Beyond it is not ductwork but a bright corridor of warm, golden light.

Your boss clears their throat behind you, but when you turn, they’re now holding the project folder open, and inside the shimmering pages you can see scenes—your own memories, hopes, unfinished ideas—all drifting like clouds.

The music grows louder. You realize the impossible deadline isn’t a threat; it’s an invitation.

You take a step toward the glowing corridor, the carpet beneath your feet softening into something like moss. The office fades behind you. Ahead, the project folder transforms into a lantern in your hand, guiding your way.

You walk forward.

And the moment you cross the threshold, you understand:
you were never being asked to complete the project.
You were being asked to choose what you want to create.

What happens next is entirely up to you.
