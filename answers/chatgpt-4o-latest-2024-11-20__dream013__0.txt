feel an uncanny sense of both urgency and wonder. The walls of the maze shift and ripple like liquid silver, reflecting your own face back at you, but it’s not your face — not exactly. There are moments where it smiles, even when you don’t, or frowns when you feel calm. The deeper you go, these reflections start to whisper, their voices faint and fragmented, like half-remembered dreams.

The next puzzle you encounter is a massive, glowing grid suspended in midair. The grid flickers with shifting symbols—stars, keys, eyes, and spiraling patterns that seem to extend endlessly into some other dimension. A small podium rises from the ground in front of the grid, displaying an etched inscription:  

*"Match what is seen, not what is seen through you."*  

Perplexed but drawn to unravel the meaning, you notice an orb hovering beside the podium. When you touch it, the symbols on the grid flicker and rearrange themselves, as if responding to your thoughts. You realize this is a test—maybe of your perception, or perhaps your ability to ignore distractions. The symbols, you deduce, must be matched based on how they reflect the surroundings of the maze, not their inherent shapes. Time stretches strangely here, seconds feeling like hours yet slipping by too fast.

With painstaking care, you solve the grid, and as it lights up with a soft golden hue, the floor beneath you begins to tremble. A long hallway opens beyond the grid, but as you step forward, you suddenly notice the silver walls again forming faces—familiar ones. They’re voices from your life, people you’ve loved, people you’ve lost. They plead, warn, congratulate, and sometimes simply stare with quiet understanding.

In the hallway, the puzzles become less physical and more... emotional. You’re faced with choices—each one weighs heavily, and you can feel the ripples of their consequences even before you make them. A door looms ahead, golden and intricate, but before you can fully approach, the whispers return louder now.  

"You don’t want to wake up," one says.

"Why did you come here?" another demands.

The golden door creaks open just a crack, and from within, a blinding light pours through. But it’s not warm or inviting—it’s overwhelming, like a truth too expansive for your mind to comprehend. You hesitate at the threshold, wondering if solving the puzzles was worth reaching this point. And then you feel it—something tugging you, not your body but your awareness itself, as if the maze is reluctant to let you leave.

What do you do? Do you step through the door, or do you turn back, delving deeper into the maze to find something... else? It feels like you’ve been here for hours, days, maybe even longer, but the choice feels final, like it leads either to awakening or to forgetting yourself entirely.
