You are dreaming. I'll continue this dream sequence for you:

You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and symbols etched into its dark wooden surface. Your fingers trace the delicate carvings—spiraling constellations, ancient runes, and what appears to be a map of some forgotten place.

As moonlight spills through your window, it catches the box at just the right angle. The patterns begin to glow with a soft blue luminescence. The box warms beneath your touch, and you feel a subtle vibration, as if something inside is responding to you.

Suddenly, one of the symbols—a crescent moon—shifts beneath your fingertip. You press it gently, and it recedes into the wood with a satisfying click. This reveals another symbol beside it, a star, which you instinctively press next. A sequence emerges in your mind, though you can't explain how you know it.

One by one, you press the glowing symbols in order: moon, star, mountain, river, tree. With each press, the box hums louder, the blue glow intensifying until it illuminates your entire room.

After the final symbol, the box's lid splits along an invisible seam and slowly opens. Light pours out, not just blue now but every color imaginable, some you've never seen before. Inside isn't an object but what appears to be a window—a portal to somewhere else. Through it, you glimpse a landscape of impossible beauty: floating islands, cascading waterfalls that flow upward, and creatures of light dancing through crystal forests.

A gentle breeze carries the scent of unknown flowers from the other side. Something is calling you forward, inviting you to reach in—or perhaps step through entirely. The choice is yours, and somehow you know that whatever you decide will change everything...
