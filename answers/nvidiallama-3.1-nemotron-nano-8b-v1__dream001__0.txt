In this vast, unfamiliar city, you stumble upon a puzzle hidden within the sights and the drawbridge-scraped stones of the dilapidated market you found earlier. Outside your tent, everything is confusing. **The time** could be your only clue. 

- Turn one hour on a precise, steep _ruler_-marked **timeline** hangs above the tents of a sliding cliff. The mountain (Upper Cut) points upward at 10:10 AM on it, and the river (10: template A1 OP PRO on the tents!) glimmering to the west bursts at 11: 11 AM. 
- Buy a detailed map from a passing merchant that resembles a foldable barn wall. 
- Follow the instructions on the map: veer north by the East Ruler (remembering the third shadow is mountain) and how number 3 (walled) is pro-left (time to river). 
- Flinch at the shadow of an imposing tower ( Terra Prime ). Feel the ground tremble softly—**this area may look to your messy search, but follow the map finally finds you.**

(Just say from the ruler (Time = Approximate Hours) :

1. Mountain at 10:10 AM 

2. River at 11:11 AM

Hint: lean the ruler toward the just started morning into the coin-ping Cycle))
