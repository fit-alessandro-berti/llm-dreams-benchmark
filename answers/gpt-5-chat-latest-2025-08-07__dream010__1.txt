...each challenge feels stranger and more surreal than the last. The first one seems easy enough — solve a puzzle where the pieces are glowing fragments of your happiest memories. You fit them together and suddenly you’re there, reliving the moment, until a voice from above says, “Time’s up,” and you’re pulled back.

The next challenge is trickier. You’re placed in a vast library whose shelves stretch into the clouds, but all the books are blank. Your task is to fill a single book with everything you’ve learned about who you are. You try to write, but the pen leaks not ink, but swirling colors — your thoughts turning into living shapes that float away into the aisles. 

Competitors around you build their books quickly, but somehow, you know your way is different. You chase the drifting colors, collecting them, shaping them back into words. That’s when you realize the judges aren’t people at all — they’re versions of yourself at different ages, watching silently.

As the final challenge begins, the dream twists. You stand on a narrow bridge suspended over shifting clouds, each step triggering a scene from a possible future. Some are brilliant, filled with joy and success, others are shadowy and uncertain. The finish line — your dream job — glows faintly in the distance, but in your heart, you sense that getting there isn’t about walking faster, but about choosing which possible self you carry with you onto that glowing platform.

You take a breath, make your choice, and—

Would you like me to keep going and reveal what happens when you reach the end of the bridge, or stop here to leave it mysterious?
