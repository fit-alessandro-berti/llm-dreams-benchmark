Okay, I'm dreaming... The forest path was dappled with sunlight, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth. I was leisurely strolling, listening to the gentle chirping of birds, a sense of deep calm washing over me. Then, it happened. The air grew heavy, the birds fell silent, and the leaves rustled with an unnatural urgency. The vibrant green of the forest seemed to dull, the sky above transitioning from a bright cerulean to a bruised purple. A cold wind whipped through the trees, carrying the smell of ozone. I felt the prickling awareness of a storm approaching and...

... I saw it swirling into existence, a monstrous vortex of darkness right above the treetops. It wasn't just a storm; it was a maelstrom of shadows and swirling, inky clouds. Lightning flashed within its depths, not the white-hot crackle I knew, but a deep, violet-tinged discharge that seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy. The wind intensified, tearing at my clothes and whipping fallen leaves into a frenzied dance around my feet. The forest, once a haven of peace, now felt like a place of raw, unleashed power. 

I knew instinctively that this wasn’t just a regular storm. This was something else, something ancient and untamed. A deep sense of fear mixed with a strange, compelling fascination washed over me. I felt an urge, not to run, but to understand. My feet, against all logic, began to move not away from the storm, but towards it. I noticed a faint, rhythmic pulse emanating from the swirling darkness, almost like a heartbeat.

As I moved closer, the trees around me seemed to shift and writhe, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. Whispers, carried on the wind, began to fill my ears – unintelligible murmurs that seemed to speak of forgotten gods and primeval forces. The ground beneath my feet felt spongy, almost like walking on moss, and I noticed the forest floor itself seemed to pulse with that same faint, violet light that was flashing within the storm. I reached out my hand, compelled to touch the strange, glowing vegetation. As my fingertips grazed a luminous moss-covered rock, a jolt of energy shot through me, and... I woke up, heart pounding, the image of the storm still vivid in my mind. The scent of ozone still lingered in the air, a phantom echo of the dream. I sat up, clutching my chest, wondering what that storm meant, and what exactly had I touched.
