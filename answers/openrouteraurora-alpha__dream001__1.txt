You start to glide through the streets on a tide of neon‑blue mist that seems to rise from the cobblestones themselves. The city is a kaleidoscope of impossible angles—towering arches that bend inward like the ribs of a giant sea creature, glass façades that reflect not the sky but the memories of people you’ve never met. Every corner you turn, the name of the street rearranges itself, spelling out words that feel both familiar and foreign: **“Remember,” “Soon,” “Listen.”**

A soft chime rings in your ears, and you realize the hour is slipping away like sand through a cracked hourglass. You glance at your watch, but the hands spin in reverse, counting down to a moment you can’t yet see. A gentle breeze carries the scent of rain on hot pavement, and you hear a distant murmur—like a choir of whispers—calling your name.

You follow the sound, and the city begins to pulse. Buildings stretch and contract, breathing in rhythm with your heartbeat. A narrow alley opens into a garden of glass‑leafed trees whose branches are woven from light. In the center of the garden stands a single, towering door made of polished obsidian, its surface rippling like a pond disturbed by a stone.

A figure steps out from the shadows—a woman in a coat of shifting colors, her eyes reflecting the city’s skyline. She doesn’t speak; instead, she offers you a small, silver key that hums with a low, resonant tone. As you take it, the key’s surface mirrors the path you’ve walked, showing you the places you’ve passed: the market of floating stalls, the bridge that arches over a river of ink, the cathedral whose spires are made of music.

The woman gestures toward the obsidian door. “The meeting is not a place,” she says, her voice a blend of wind and distant bells. “It is a moment you must create.” She steps aside, and the door slides open, revealing a room that is both empty and full—walls of transparent glass that show you a version of yourself sitting at a table, a notebook open, a pen poised to write.

You step inside, and the city outside folds into a single point of light, a star that spins slowly in the center of your chest. The notebook’s pages flutter, each one filling with words you never thought you could say: **“I am here,” “I have arrived,” “I will remember.”** As you write, the words lift off the page, becoming tiny fireflies that drift upward, joining the constellations of the dream‑city.

When the last firefly settles, the room dissolves, and you find yourself back on the bustling streets, the hour hand now pointing exactly at the moment of your meeting. The crowd parts, revealing a modest café tucked between two towering spires. Inside, a table is set for one, a steaming cup of coffee waiting, and a handwritten note that reads simply: **“Welcome. You made it.”**

You sit down, take a sip, and feel the weight of the city’s endless possibilities settle into a quiet certainty. The meeting is not about a location; it is about the journey you took to find yourself within the labyrinth of dreams. And as the coffee warms your hands, you realize that the city, the mist, the key—all of it was a reminder that the most important meetings are the ones you hold with your own heart.
