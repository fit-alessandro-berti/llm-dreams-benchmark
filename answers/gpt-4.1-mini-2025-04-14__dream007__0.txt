step outside to cool down. The cool night air feels refreshing against your skin, and the distant city lights flicker like stars. As you breathe deeply, you notice a soft melody drifting on the breeze, familiar and soothing. You follow the sound to find your friend playing a gentle tune on a guitar. The tension begins to melt away as the music reminds you both of happier times. You sit down beside them, and without words, the bond between you rekindles, stronger than before.
