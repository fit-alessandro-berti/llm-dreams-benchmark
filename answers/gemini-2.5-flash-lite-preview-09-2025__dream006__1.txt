As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to **realize that you are wearing only a brightly colored, slightly too-small swimming costume.**

The silence in the massive auditorium is thick enough to slice with a butter knife. You can see individual faces—some smiling encouragingly, others looking frankly bewildered. The microphone stand in front of you seems to shimmer under the stage lights, mocking your exposed knees.

You open your mouth, intending to deliver the carefully crafted introduction you’ve rehearsed a thousand times—a powerful statement about the future of sustainable energy, perhaps, or a poignant reflection on shared human experience.

But what comes out instead is not a word, but a **perfectly pitched, mournful call of a lost sea bird.**

The sound echoes through the hall. Then, the floor beneath your feet begins to shift. It doesn't just move; it **dissolves into a deep, shimmering expanse of turquoise water.**

You don't fall. Instead, you are gently buoyed up, the water perfectly supporting you. The audience remains exactly where they were, perched on the edges of what is now the shore of this impossible, brightly lit inland sea. They are no longer looking expectant; they are **all wearing snorkel masks and holding small, silver fish that they are attempting to juggle.**

You look down at your swimming costume. It is no longer too small; it is now intricately embroidered with tiny, glowing constellations. You realize you don't need to speak. You just need to move.

You take a deep breath, not of air, but of the clean, cool water, and **begin to swim toward the center of the hall, which is now marked by a colossal, slowly rotating gramophone.** The music it plays is not a tune you know, but the *feeling* of the color indigo.

As you swim, the silver fish held by the audience members begin to detach themselves, flying out of their hands like shimmering arrows, and circling you in a beautiful, silent vortex, lighting your way to the gramophone, which seems to be the only solid piece of land left in this vast, aquatic amphitheater of expectation. **You know, with the unshakeable certainty of a dream, that if you can just touch the needle of the record player, the tide will turn, and you will finally know what the speech was supposed to be about.**
