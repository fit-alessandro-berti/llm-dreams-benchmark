symbols etched into its surface—spirals, celestial bodies, and what look like fragments of ancient constellations. As your fingers trace the carvings, your surroundings begin to shimmer and shift. The once-dark forest around you glows a deep twilight blue, and the stars above shimmer brighter than you’ve ever seen.

Suddenly, a soft humming vibrates through the air. The box responds, its patterns beginning to glow faintly, pulsing in rhythm with the hum. Something inside you tells you that it’s not about finding a physical key…the patterns themselves are the key.

Instinctively, you begin turning the box in your hands, aligning the celestial motifs in a specific way—moon to star, spiral to spiral. With a soft *click*, a hidden compartment slides open, revealing a sphere of light cradled within—vibrant, pulsing, alive.

The moment your fingertips brush its surface, your vision blurs and your feet lift from the ground. You’re rising, floating upward through the canopy, through the sky, into a vast expanse of cosmos. Planets, nebulae, and streaks of golden stardust whirl around you.

A voice, neither male nor female, echoes in your mind:  
*"The key is not to unlock the box, but to unlock yourself. You are the dreamer. And the dream."*

And suddenly, the box is gone. The forest is gone. Everything dissolves into light as you awaken with a thin layer of stardust on your hands—and just the faintest echo of that cosmic hum in your ears.
