You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find a way to communicate with the locals before they notice your anachronistic clothing and speech**. The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth, and the cobblestone streets are lined with thatched-roof cottages and bustling market stalls. A group of villagers nearby are haggling over bundles of herbs, their dialect a melodic mix of unfamiliar sounds.  

Your modern clothes—jeans, a hoodie, sneakers—are drawing curious glances. A child points at you, giggling, while an elderly woman crosses herself, muttering about omens. Panic flickers in your chest. You need to blend in, but how? Your phone is gone, your wallet is useless, and the only tool you have is a pocketknife.  

As you duck into a shadowed alley, you notice a faded symbol carved into the stone wall—a serpent coiled around a sun. It feels familiar, like a logo from a dream you can’t remember. Suddenly, a hand grabs your wrist. A man in a tunic, his eyes sharp with suspicion, whispers, “You’re not from here. Come with me—before the Watchers see you.”  

He leads you through a labyrinth of narrow streets to a hidden workshop filled with gears, parchment, and strange contraptions. “You’re the third stranger this month,” he says, studying you. “But you’re different. Can you read this?” He slides a scroll across the table, its script intricate and alien.  

You lean in, heart racing. The symbols… they’re not random. They’re a code. And somehow, you *understand* them.  

The dream deepens. What will you do next?
