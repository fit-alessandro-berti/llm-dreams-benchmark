You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the soft green moss under your feet starts to sway as though it were caught in an invisible current. The tree trunks, moments before serene and sturdy, begin to twist and groan. The high canopy of leaves that once glimmered with gentle sunlight now tightens into a swirling ceiling of ink-black clouds. A distant rumble thrums through the earth.

At first, the rain comes in sparse, fat droplets that patter on the leaves and send brief glimmers of reflected light dancing across the forest floor. But soon, it intensifies, each drop hitting with a force that feels personal, as though the storm is intent on getting your attention. The earthy smell of petrichor thickens in the air, mingling with a metallic tang you can’t quite name.

You notice something strange: as the wind picks up, the branches don’t just sway; they seem to bend deliberately, forming hollowed-out shapes. Within those gaps, you glimpse fleeting images—a gleam of a silver river snaking through a distant valley, a cluster of fireflies forming patterns that resemble constellations, and even the silhouette of a large, antlered creature watching you from behind a gnarled oak. Each vision lasts only a moment before the branches shift again.

Struggling to find shelter, you push through thick ferns, their leaves wet and gleaming under the sudden dark. You pass a low-hanging bough and emerge into a small clearing encircled by stones. At the center stands a lone birch tree, its white bark almost glowing. The storm rages above, but here, within this ring of stones, the rain’s violence softens to a gentle tap. There’s a hush, a quiet expectancy. Your ears ring with silence after the roar of wind and rain.

Then, beneath the faint sound of the rain, you hear a voice—or maybe it’s just the rustle of leaves. You cannot make out words, only the comforting hum of presence. A sensation of warmth builds within your chest, as though an invisible fire has been lit there. Your heart beats more steadily, and you sense that this birch tree, and perhaps the circle of stones, has been waiting for you. It stands as a calm witness to the storm’s fury, a still point in a spinning world.

You approach the tree, compelled by something beyond curiosity—an urge to connect, to learn. When you place your hand against the smooth bark, you feel the pulse of something ancient. In that instant, the storm surges again, and you feel wind tugging at your clothes. The stones tremble, and the vision in the branches returns, clearer now: you see yourself walking not just through this forest but through many others, across seasons and years, always searching for something unnamed. You see flashes of distant mountains, of calm lakes holding mirrored skies, and of old footpaths grown over with wildflowers. The images flicker like pages in a dream-journal, lit by lightning.

A final bolt crashes overhead, and you realize you’re no longer drenched. The storm has passed as suddenly as it came. The forest smells fresh and green. The birch tree’s branches sigh gently, as if relieved. A path, previously hidden beneath tangled vines and fallen branches, now lies clear before you, curving deeper into the wood. You feel a sense of purpose. You have been given a sign—though you don’t yet know what it means—and in the hush after the storm, you understand you must follow that new trail. The dream’s invitation is clear: your journey has only just begun.
