You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to settle it the only way that makes sense in dreams: by racing to the top of a towering, iridescent mountain made entirely of forgotten childhood toys.

Your friend nods fiercely, eyes blazing with the same fire, and suddenly you're both at the base. The ground shifts like jelly under your feet—rubber dinosaurs bounce you upward, Slinkys uncoil into ladders that stretch toward cotton-candy clouds. You climb, shout accusations mid-leap: "You always hog the last slice!" "You stole my favorite comic!"

Halfway up, the mountain sprouts wings—massive, feathered ones from a thousand stuffed birds—and you both soar, twisting through storms of glitter and whispers from old lullabies. Your friend's face morphs into a grinning fox, then back, laughing maniacally as they pull ahead on a skateboard carved from a jack-in-the-box.

You summon a jetpack from pure willpower, fueled by the argument's fury, rocketing past. At the summit, a throne of Lego bricks awaits, glowing with the answer: neither of you was wrong. You hug, the mountain dissolves into fireworks, and you tumble into freefall...

...waking up tangled in sheets, the argument forgotten, but the thrill lingering like morning dew.
