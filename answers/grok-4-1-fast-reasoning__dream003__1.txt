symbols etched into its surface—swirling galaxies, ancient runes that shift like living ink, and eyes that seem to wink when you blink. Your fingers trace them, and a warm hum vibrates through your hand, pulling you deeper into the dream's embrace.

Suddenly, the box levitates, spinning slowly in mid-air. No key needed; your touch was the spell. It cracks open with a sigh like wind through forgotten caves, unleashing a cascade of golden light that floods the room. Inside, not treasure, but memories—yours and others'. Childhood laughter echoes as you see yourself as a kid building sandcastles that become real kingdoms. Strangers' faces flicker by: a lost love smiling, a hero from history offering a nod.

The light forms a doorway, and curiosity tugs you through. You're flying now over neon-lit cities that twist into jungles, rivers of stars flowing beneath. A voice, soft as silk, whispers from the box (now orbiting your head like a tiny moon): "What you seek is what you already hold."

You reach for it—a glowing key made of your own heartbeat. But as you grasp it, the world inverts. Colors bleed into sounds, gravity flips, and you tumble upward into wakefulness.

Your eyes snap open. Heart racing, you sit up in bed, glancing around your dim room. No box. Just the faint echo of that hum in your chest. Was it real? You smile, knowing dreams like that leave doors cracked open forever.
