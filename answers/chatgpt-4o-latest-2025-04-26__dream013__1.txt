find that the walls themselves seem to shift and breathe, responding to your emotions. When you're calm, the path ahead glows faintly, guiding you toward the next puzzle. But when fear or doubt creeps in, the maze tightens, corridors closing off, forcing you into darker, more confusing passages.

You reach a massive circular chamber. In its center is a strange device: a large, ancient clock with no hands, surrounded by stone pedestals. On each pedestal rests a different object — a feather, a flame, a mirror, and a small stone. A voice, distant but clear, echoes around the chamber: *"Choose wisely. Time is not what it seems."*

You sense that each object represents a different path — not just through the maze, but through something deeper: parts of yourself you've forgotten or hidden away. As you hover your hand over the objects, each one pulses faintly with warmth, and the air thickens with anticipation.

Which one do you choose?
