…look down to see your laptop is slowly melting into the desk, keys sinking out of reach. You try to call your boss over, but the words come out in slow motion, thick and sludgy, like trying to speak underwater.

Your boss's face shifts, blurring in and out of focus, sometimes morphing into familiar faces from your childhood, sometimes stretching into caricatures, but always impatient, tapping their foot at an endless speed. Papers begin to flutter from the ceiling like snow, covering your computer, your hands, burying the deadline beneath a mounting drift.

You reach out for the nearest paper, hoping for answers, but the words are written in a language you don't recognize, symbols that dance and rearrange themselves faster than your eyes can follow. The clock on the wall starts spinning backwards, then forwards, its hands twisting and stretching.

Suddenly, all sound rushes away, and you realize you’re sitting at your desk alone, but the whole office has transformed into a greenhouse—plants growing out of file cabinets, flowers blooming from coffee mugs, ivy reaching for your keyboard. The project is nowhere to be seen. Instead, you feel an overwhelming sense of calm wash over you as you realize none of it matters—just for this moment, you watch as sunlight fills the room, and impossibility feels like freedom.
