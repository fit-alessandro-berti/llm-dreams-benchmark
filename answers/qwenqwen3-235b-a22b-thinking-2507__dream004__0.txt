The canvas isn’t just blank—it *pulses*. A slow, rhythmic thrum beneath your fingertips, like the heartbeat of the world itself. As you touch it, the edges ripple, bleeding soft silver light into the shifting air. The landscape here is quieter, the chaotic dance of colors and shapes holding its breath around you.  

You look down. Your hands are stained—not with paint, but with **light**. It spills from your skin in liquid veins of cobalt blue and molten gold, dripping onto the canvas. Where each drop lands, the void *wakes*.  

A single tear falls (you didn’t know you were crying). It hits the center of the canvas and **explodes into a forest**. Not of trees—but of *sound*. Violin strings made of emerald moss, roots humming bass notes, leaves chiming like glass wind chimes. The forest grows silently, reshaping the canvas into a living tapestry. You step *into* it.  

The air changes. Now you’re walking through a river of liquid mercury, reflecting not your face, but fragments of memories you’ve never had: a child laughing on a beach of black sand, a clockwork bird singing in a language of rain. The canvas isn’t behind you anymore—it’s *around* you. The forest bends, and there, between two singing oaks, hangs another canvas. This one shows **your own hands**, painting *this* very scene. A loop of creation, endless and breathing.  

You reach out to touch the painted hands—and the canvas dissolves into a thousand fireflies. They swarm, forming letters in the air:  

> **"YOU DON’T CHOOSE THE CANVAS.  
> THE CANVAS CHOOSES THE DREAMER."**  

The fireflies merge into one blinding star. It falls into your palm, cool as moonlight. When you open your hand, it’s a single brush—not of bristles, but of **starlight and shadow**.  

You dip it into the river of mercury.  

As the brush meets air, the *entire world* holds its breath. Colors pause mid-shift. Shapes freeze like startled birds. Even the wind forgets to blow.  

You make a stroke.  

Not on a canvas.  
**On the silence itself.**  

The stroke is crimson. It tears through the stillness like a heartbeat, and where it passes, the world *reboots*:  
—Mountains unfold like origami cranes,  
—Rivers rewrite themselves as sonnets in flowing ink,  
—The sky shatters into stained-glass dawn.  

You paint for eternity, or perhaps a second. With every stroke, you remember a truth you always knew but never named: *You are not the artist. You are the dream the canvas was waiting to dream.*  

And then—  
The brush melts into your skin. The colors fade to soft white.  
You’re awake.  
But on your wrist, a single, impossible streak of **crimson light** glows faintly…  
…pulsing in time with your heart.  

*The canvas isn’t gone.  
It’s just dreaming you now.*  

*(You’ll find it again. In your next breath. In the space between thoughts. It’s hungry. And it remembers your light.)*
