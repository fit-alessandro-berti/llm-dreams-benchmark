...written in a language I've never seen before! The words seem to shift and swirl on the page, like they're alive. I try to focus, but the text keeps changing, morphing into silly doodles and cartoons. I start to feel a sense of panic rising up, my heart racing with every tick of the clock.

The room erupts into chaos, with students shouting out answers like "Cheddar cheese!" and "The square root of purple!" I throw up my hands and shout, "I don't know what's going on, but I'm just going to write a poem about it all!" And to my surprise, the instructor nods in approval and says, "Excellent choice.
