...find something to cover yourself. The coarse wool blanket you've woken beneath smells of woodsmoke and animal fat, but it's shamefully insufficient for the bustling market square you're now standing in. A woman in a linen coif stares openly at your synthetic pajamas, her mouth forming a perfect 'O' of scandalized wonder.

You need to *blend in* before the watchman—who carries a halberd like it's a natural extension of his arm—finishes his suspicious circuit of the well. Your pockets are empty except for a crumpled grocery receipt and a single house key, both meaningless here, both *dangerously* meaningless. The parchment-like quality of the receipt almost passes until you see the barcode, which shimmers with an unholy glow that only you seem to notice.

But more urgently, you need to understand *the rule* of this place. In dreams, places have rules. A boy brushes past, and as he does, you catch a fragment of his thought like a radio signal: *"...after the bell tolls three, the streets remember..."*

Remember what? You turn to ask, but he's already gone, vanished between a fishmonger's stall and a wall that shouldn't have an alley. The church bell tolls once. 

Twice.

You need to decide: find clothing, or understand the rule before the third toll. In dreams, you can only ever chase one need at a time. The rest always becomes smoke.
