decide to take refuge under a large, ancient oak tree. The tree provides shelter, but as the storm intensifies, you realize the roots of the tree are glowing faintly, illuminating the ground beneath you in a mesmerizing display.

Curious, you kneel to touch the glowing roots and feel a subtle pulse, as if the tree is alive and communicating in a language you can't quite comprehend. The air around you hums with energy, and suddenly, the tree begins to shake. Branches sway wildly, and you notice small, colorful lights emerging from the bark, dispersing into the stormy sky.

Just as you start to feel overwhelmed, a figure steps out from the shadows. It’s a wise old owl, perched on a nearby branch, its eyes glowing with wisdom. The owl speaks to you, not with words, but through a gentle vibration in your mind:

"The storm is a reflection of the chaos within. You must embrace the power of the unknown and trust in the unseen forces guiding you."

With a final burst of light, the storm dissipates, and the forest returns to its serene calm. The owl spreads its wings and flies away, leaving you standing alone under the oak tree. You feel a renewed sense of peace, as if the dream has taught you something profound.

You wake up, feeling refreshed and inspired, with a lingering curiosity about the dream's message and the glowing tree.
