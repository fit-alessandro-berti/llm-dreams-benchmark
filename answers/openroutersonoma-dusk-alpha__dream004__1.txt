a paintbrush that hovers in mid-air, whispering secrets of forgotten galaxies. I reach for it, and as my fingers touch its ethereal bristles, the canvas ignites with swirling vortices of emerald and sapphire, pulling me into its depths. Suddenly, I'm tumbling through a kaleidoscope of floating islands, where trees grow upside down and rivers flow backward, carrying laughter from invisible crowds. In the distance, a colossal clock made of melting wax ticks erratically, marking the rhythm of my heartbeat as the dream blurs into wakefulness, leaving me yearning for one more brushstroke.
