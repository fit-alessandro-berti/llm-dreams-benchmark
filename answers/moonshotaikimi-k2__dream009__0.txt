…breathe with the rhythm of this place before I can do anything else.

I sit up slowly—my clothes are gone, replaced by coarse linen that smells of smoke and tallow. The air is heavy with pine pitch and horse. A rooster that has no right to be that loud announces dawn beyond shutters that aren’t shutters at all, but oiled goatskin stretched across a timber frame. Someone has left a clay cup of water beside the sleeping mat; when I drink, the water is mountain-cold and carries a faint taste of copper, as if it remembers passing over ore in the dark.

First rule, I decide: learn what century owns this earth. 

I step outside. The sky is raw pearl, and the horizon is serrated with peaks I half-recognize—these are the mountains that cradle my city back home, but without ski runs, without radio masts, without the small scar of a highway. A village clings to the slope: timber roofs the color of dark honey, haylofts perched like birds on stilts, and mist drifting through corrals where shaggy cattle switch their tails. There is no hum of power lines, no soft suitcase drone of a distant jet. Just hoofbeats and the clank of iron on a farrier’s anvil marking time.

Conversation drifts to me—middle Germanic, I think, but salted with Latin borrowings. I have five semesters of historical linguistics stored in the sleep-heavy folds of my memory; I sift the words like dry beans until one clicks: *Thornviertel*. If the name is true, thirteenth century, Rhineland foothills. I whisper it to myself to plant the flag of certainty.

Why am I here? And how long before whatever dream-logic brought me decides to yank me back?

I need information, allies, and—my stomach growls—food enough to keep reasoning intact. I start down the sloping path toward the only place with open shutters already coughing chimney-smoke into the light: a communal smithy built against a granary. The smith is hammer-rangy, long hair braided with soot-gray leather. When he sees me, he stills the hammer mid-swing. The look he gives me is wary, but something else flickers underneath—recognition? awe? He lowers his gaze in a gesture that feels…obedient, as if he knows me by rumor. 

Behind him, the back wall is hung with horseshoes, farm tools, and an iron eight-pointed star no bigger than a plate. My eyes fix on it: the star looks newly forged, edges fresh-filed and still bright where the fire has kissed. The smith catches the direction of my stare.

He says—slow and deliberate, because he suspects I strain to parse the vowels—“It is finished, *Herr Magister*. If the sky opens again tonight, we hang it high and the gate will hold.”

Herr Magister. Gate. Sky opening.

They think me the man who was summoned ahead of the danger they fear. 

And there it is: the thing I didn’t know I needed—to decide in the next heartbeat whether I will lie and doom them, or try to fill a stranger’s impossible shoes.
