...and suddenly, the room seems to stretch endlessly, like a ballroom pulled from a funhouse mirror. The air is thick with laughter that echoes in reverse, and the floor beneath your feet feels like it's made of soft, shifting sand, making each step a deliberate effort. You weave through the first group: a cluster of Victorian-era gentlemen in top hats, sipping tea from cups that float mid-air. One turns to you with eyes like swirling galaxies and whispers, "Have you seen the clock that ticks backward? It's where the lost ones hide." You nod politely, but their words dissolve into bubbles that pop with tiny sparks, and you move on, heart pounding a little faster.

Next, you brush past a circle of dancers—except they're not human; they're shadows twirling in perfect sync, their forms flickering like old film reels. One reaches out a tendril-like hand, pulling you into a spin. "Join us," it murmurs in a voice like rustling leaves, "for in dreams, we all know each other." You break free, dizzy, and spot a flash of familiarity across the room—the one person you know, their back turned, laughing with strangers. But as you push forward, another group blocks your path: animals in tuxedos, debating philosophy. A fox with spectacles adjusts its monocle and asks, "If a tree falls in a forest of forgotten memories, does it make a friend?" You mumble an excuse and slip away, but now the crowd is thickening, faces morphing into masks of people from your past—old teachers, childhood friends, even your reflection staring back with accusing eyes.

The music swells, a cacophony of instruments that play themselves, and you feel the walls closing in, breathing like living things. Desperation creeps in; you call out the person's name, but it comes out as a song, drawing more eyes toward you. Finally, you break through to where you saw them, only to find... it's not them at all. It's you, a version of yourself from another life, holding a mirror that reflects infinite versions of this very gathering. "You've been looking for me all along," the other you says with a knowing smile. And just as you reach out to touch the glass, the floor gives way, and you're falling, falling into a sea of stars, the party dissolving into whispers. You wake up with a start, the echo of laughter still ringing in your ears. Or do you?
