...panic. Your heart races like a malfunctioning server, and the office clock ticks louder than a bomb in a bad spy thriller. The project? Something absurd—like redesigning the entire company's logo to incorporate quantum entanglement principles, due by lunch. Your boss, a towering figure with eyes like laser pointers, hovers over your desk, tapping a foot that echoes through the cubicles.

You dive in, fingers flying across the keyboard, but every keystroke spawns error messages in ancient hieroglyphs. Coffee spills, turning your notes into a Rorschach test of regret. Colleagues morph into helpful elves at first, whispering shortcuts, but then they sprout wings and start debating philosophy mid-sentence: "Is the deadline real, or just a simulation?"

Sweat beads, the room spins, and suddenly—poof—the boss transforms into a giant talking spreadsheet, demanding pie charts of your soul. You scream, hurl your chair, and it bounces back like a boomerang made of regret. But wait, the deadline clock rewinds. You realize it's all a dream within a dream, and with a wink from the spreadsheet-boss (who's now your childhood pet goldfish), you hit "submit." The project aces itself, confetti rains from the vents, and you wake up tangled in your sheets, grinning at the absurdity.

What happens next in *your* version of the dream?
