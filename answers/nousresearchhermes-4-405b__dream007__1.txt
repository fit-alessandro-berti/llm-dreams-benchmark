step back and take a deep breath. As you do so, the dream shifts and you find yourself standing in a serene, green meadow filled with colorful wildflowers.

Your friend is there too, and the anger seems to have dissipated from both of you. You apologize for losing your temper, and they do the same. The two of you sit down on the soft grass, feeling the warmth of the sun on your skin.

You begin to talk about the issue at hand, but this time, you listen more attentively and empathize with each other's perspectives. You reminisce about the memories you've shared and the experiences that have strengthened your bond.

As you continue talking, a gentle breeze carries the sweet scent of blossoming flowers, creating an atmosphere of peace and understanding. You realize how much you value this friendship and express gratitude for having such a supportive presence in your life.

In this dream, you come to understand the importance of communication, empathy, and forgiveness in maintaining strong relationships. When you wake up, you feel a renewed sense of connection with your friend and a determination to approach future disagreements with patience and understanding.
