written in a language you've never seen before—swirling symbols that shift and morph like living ink, whispering secrets only half-audible in your mind. Panic rises as you flip through the pages: Question 1 asks, "What is the sound of one hand clapping while juggling quantum paradoxes?" Question 2 demands you diagram the emotional trajectory of a forgotten childhood pet's soul across seven reincarnations.

The clock melts into taffy, stretching time infinitely, and just as the final question appears—"Why did you choose this path?"—the desk dissolves, you're falling through clouds of exam papers, each one a alternate life unlived.

You jolt awake, heart pounding, the alarm blaring. But wait... is that the faint outline of hieroglyphs on your ceiling?
