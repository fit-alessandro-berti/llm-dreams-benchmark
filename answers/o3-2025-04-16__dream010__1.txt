…and each challenge is stranger than the last, as only dream‑logic can allow.

1. The Paper Maze  
   You stand in a vast warehouse where the walls are stacked resumes, cover letters, and performance reviews—sheets of paper fluttering like white moths. Somewhere in this papery labyrinth is a single crimson page that contains the hiring decision.  
   • You fold a résumé into an origami compass. Its needle spins until you ask yourself aloud, “What do I value more: applause or impact?” The compass freezes, pointing left.  
   • You follow it to the crimson page, tear it free, and the whole maze collapses into a snow‑storm of confetti. You breathe in the swirling flakes and suddenly know every line of your own résumé by heart—faults and all.

2. The Interview Carousel  
   The floor becomes a carnival ride of concentric circles. Each rotating booth holds an interviewer—a child, a rival, a future version of you, a mentor long gone. As the carousel turns faster:  
   • The child interviewer asks only “Why?” five times in a row. Every answer you give strips away another buzzword until you’re left saying, “Because building things that help people makes me feel alive.”  
   • The rival offers you their pen, saying, “Prove we can both win.” You sign each other’s cast‑iron nameplates, and they dissolve into rust that stains your palms—reminding you competition can be cooperative.  
   • Future‑You merely smiles, saying nothing. The silence is terrifying, then comforting, then exhilarating.

3. The Presentation in Zero‑Gravity  
   You float inside a glass cube orbiting above a city made of circuit boards. Transparent screens circle you, each demanding a slide deck, a code demo, a five‑year plan.  
   • The clicker drifts from your hand; slides scatter like constellations. You stop grabbing and start storytelling, tracing pictures in the slide‑stars with a laser pointer made of curiosity.  
   • The judges—faceless silhouettes with glowing lapel pins—put their pens down. One by one they unhook their pins and let them drift toward you. The pins merge into a single bright emblem: a door.

4. The Door of Offer & Echo  
   When you press the emblem against the cube wall, a door outlines itself and swings open. On the other side is a quiet office bathed in dawn light. A desk, a plant you can’t kill, a window overlooking possibility.  
   A letter sits on the keyboard:  
   “We are pleased to offer you the position of _____.”  
   The blank space ripples like liquid mercury, reflecting every title you’ve ever wanted—Designer, Engineer, Storyteller, Leader, Student. You realize the job has been shape‑shifting, waiting for you to define it.

You reach for a pen to write the title that feels truest. Before ink touches paper, an alarm clock begins to chirp from somewhere behind the sunrise. The office, the door, the cube—all fold inward like a closing laptop.

You wake up in your own bed, heart racing yet calm, the memory of weightlessness still tingling in your limbs. On your nightstand is a single crimson sticky note you don’t remember leaving:

“Interview at 10:00 a.m.  
Remember: applause or impact?”

You smile, stretch, and start getting ready—not to chase a dream job, but to co‑create it.
