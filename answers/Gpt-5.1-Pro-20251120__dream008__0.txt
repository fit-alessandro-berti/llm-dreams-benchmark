…open your mouth to say something reassuring, something competent, but all that comes out is:

“Of course. No problem at all.”

Your voice sounds like it belongs to someone else—too calm, too sure. Your boss smiles, relieved, and walks away. As soon as they turn their back, the office changes.

At first it’s subtle: the fluorescent lights hum louder, flickering in a rhythm like a heartbeat. Then your desk starts to stretch, the surface lengthening like taffy, pushing your keyboard, mouse, and papers farther and farther away from you. You reach for them, but the desk keeps growing, like it’s teasing you.

On your monitor, the project brief pops open on its own.

**PROJECT DUE: 5 MINUTES AGO**

You blink. The time stamp shifts.

**DUE: NOW**

Then:

**DUE: YESTERDAY**

The words keep changing, vibrating, stuttering. Your cursor starts typing on its own. Paragraphs appear and vanish. Every time it finishes a sentence, the sentence dissolves into random letters and symbols.

You look around for help.

All your coworkers are sitting at their desks, but they’re frozen mid-motion. One is halfway through a sip of coffee, the liquid suspended in the air like a glassy brown ribbon. Another has their mouth open in a laugh that never reaches sound. The clock on the wall is spinning faster and faster, but the second hand keeps jumping backward, never moving past the same mark.

You stand up.

Your chair doesn’t scrape the floor—the floor absorbs the sound, like it’s made of thick carpet or fog. You call your boss’s name, but when you speak, your voice is swallowed before it reaches your own ears, like the air is made of cotton.

Then you notice something strange.

On every desk, on every sticky note, in every open notebook, there’s the **same** phrase written over and over:

> “DON’T FORGET WHAT YOU’RE FORGETTING.”

You look back at your own screen. The project’s title has changed.

**PROJECT: REMEMBER**

Underneath:

**DESCRIPTION: YOU KNEW HOW TO DO THIS.**

You don’t remember ever reading that before.

Your boss appears at your side again, but you don’t hear their footsteps. One moment you’re alone, the next they’re already there, too close, their presence bending the air. Their face is… blurry. You can’t focus on their features. Every time you try, they shift: sometimes it looks like your boss, sometimes like a teacher you had as a kid, sometimes like a stranger you’ve passed on the street.

“Is it done?” they ask.

You glance at the screen. The project file is open, but it’s blank—just a white page and a blinking cursor that pulses in time with your heartbeat.

“I… I don’t even know what it *is*,” you say, and this time the words come out as a thin, distant echo, like you’re speaking from the end of a long hallway.

Your boss tilts their head.

“Oh, you do,” they say, but their mouth doesn’t move. You’re not sure if you heard them with your ears or your thoughts. “You’ve done this before. Over and over.”

The fluorescent lights above you flicker, then go out.

The entire office plunges into a dim twilight, illuminated only by the glow of your computer screen. All the monitors at all the desks light up at once, and every single one of them shows **your** project file—your blank page, your blinking cursor.

You can feel a pressure on your chest, like time itself is sitting on your ribs.

You sit back down.

Your chair feels different now, larger, softer, like a throne made of old to-do lists. The keyboard is suddenly right in front of you again, no longer at the end of a stretching desk. Your hands hover over the keys.

“Start,” your boss says. Their voice is gentle now, almost kind. “Just start.”

“I don’t know where,” you whisper.

A notification pops up in the corner of your screen.

🔔 **REMINDER: YOU ARE DREAMING**

You stare at it. The notification text repeats, pulsing. For a moment, everything goes very still. The spinning clock slows. The hum of the lights fades to silence. Even your heartbeat seems to pause, hanging in the air.

You read it again.

> You are dreaming.

And something inside you clicks.

If you’re dreaming, then the deadline isn’t real. The rules aren’t real. The office isn’t real. The impossible timing, the blank page, the frozen coworkers—all of it is malleable, like wet clay.

You look at your hands on the keyboard and think, *What if it’s already done?*

The cursor on the screen jumps.

Lines of text begin to appear—paragraph after paragraph, diagrams, charts, slides, polished sentences. The project builds itself in a rapid cascade, perfectly formatted, every point you were supposed to remember somehow already there, as if you’d written it a hundred times before.

Your boss leans in over your shoulder.

“That’s better,” they say, their voice echoing from somewhere very far away and very close all at once. “See? You always had it.”

You scroll. The work is immaculate. Every question already answered, every section complete.

At the bottom of the document, there is one final line, in a different font:

> **You are allowed to wake up now.**

Your boss taps the screen with one fingertip. The office starts to dissolve, pixel by pixel. The walls flicker into static, the desks break into floating squares of light, the spinning clock melts into a bright, white circle.

You feel yourself tipping backward, falling through your chair, through the floor, through the building, through all the unfinished tasks and unread emails and half-remembered meetings. As you fall, you realize the pressure on your chest is fading, the deadline shrinking to the size of a tiny, harmless dot.

Somewhere above you—or below you, or inside you—a voice says, calmly:

“You did enough.”

You exhale.

The white circle of the melting clock grows until it fills everything, until there is nothing left but brightness.

And then—

You blink awake.
