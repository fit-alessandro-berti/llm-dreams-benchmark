…and a brush that isn’t a brush at all, but a slender filament of light humming between your fingers like a small, patient bee. The canvas hangs in the air without support, a hush in the middle of all the shifting. Even the wind seems to pause there, as if it, too, is curious what happens next.

When you touch the tip to the blankness, the canvas breathes. A ripple shivers outward, subtle as the margin between waking and sleep. You don’t dip the brush in paint; instead you think of the smell of rain on warm stone, and the color answers—a blue so soft it carries the memory of a summer evening. You think of the taste of ripe peaches, and a gold that feels like laughter finds your hand. Thought becomes hue, feeling becomes line. Around you, the other colors and shapes slow their frantic shuffling to watch.

You paint a horizon because the world needs somewhere to rest its eyes. A line happens, delicate and sure, and the ground beneath your feet discovers itself. Gravity, grateful for an anchor, leans in closer. You sketch a small tree, and the leaves you imagine flutter down and attach themselves, rustling in a language you almost understand. When you add a door to the trunk—just a little rectangle, just for fun—the bark knocks politely from inside.

Something opens. A figure steps out of the tree, and for a breath you think it is a stranger. Then you notice the way their shoelace is always untied, the way their gaze skips from sky to puddle and back, and you know them. You, but from a time when pockets were made to hold pebbles and secrets. They grin at you with that easy, gap-toothed certainty and hold out a hand.

“Don’t forget to paint what you can’t say,” they tell you, and when they take your brush, the stroke they make is not a line but a sound: the syllables of your name the way your grandmother used to say it, warm as bread. The sound hangs in the air shimmering, then settles into the canvas as a silver path.

You walk it together, stepping up onto the painting as if it were a floor. The world you leave behind flickers like a kaleidoscope trying not to sneeze. On the path, doors appear: a door labeled Later, a door labeled The Thing You Missed, a door so small it could only belong to a worry. You try one at random. Inside that painted door is a room where the ceiling is a map of constellations you drew in crayon once, connecting stars to make shapes you liked because the official shapes didn’t fit. The air smells like pencil shavings. On a shelf is a jar with a lid, and inside is a storm you bottled years ago and forgot about. The storm looks at you from its glass prison and asks, without words, if it might be turned into music.

You unscrew the lid. The storm sighs out, not as thunder but as a cello note that makes your ribs ring. In the distance, the real sky blushes with gratitude. A few of the wild colors threading through the landscape come to heel like shy animals. Your younger self nods, satisfied, and rummages in your pocket until they find nothing at all. They giggle. “Still keeping the important parts empty,” they say, and run ahead.

The canvas deepens. It isn’t flat anymore; it’s a lake. Beneath its surface drift pieces of rooms you’ve loved, and streets you’ve almost walked down, and words you’ve never said aloud because there wasn’t a mouth for them at the time. You kneel and touch the water. Your fingers come away with a color that doesn’t exist while you’re awake, a color that holds the ache behind your smile and the bright ring of your most private joy together without having to choose. You paint with it around the edges of the world, a frame that doesn’t bind so much as remind.

When fear tiptoes up, as it always does—wearing a different face every time—you don’t hide. You lift the brush and think the exact shape of the fear, its temperature, the way it sits in your stomach like a small stone. The canvas accepts this, too, and gives you a transparent paint that dries into wind. You brush it across the looming edges, and the fear learns to move instead of stay. It goes on its way, ruffling the leaves you made, turning the pages of books you haven’t read yet.

You paint a small, stubborn flame. Not fireworks, not a brilliant sun—just a candle’s steady heart. Around it, the chaos politely steps back to make room. Things that were always almost there come forward and take chairs. The table sets itself. Your younger self climbs up, swings their legs, and, with the stern authority of children, declares this place real.

“That’s all?” you ask, surprised by the relief that blooms. “A little light?”

“Light is the first door,” they say, as though reciting a rule everyone knows. “And the last.”

You feel it then: the brush thrums against your palm in time with your pulse. The canvas hums back, a soft chord. The horizon you drew draws a breath and exhales a path beyond itself, a seam opening in the distance. You stand, and you go to it. The seam looks like the space between curtains in the morning, when the day leaks through before you’re ready.

On the other side is not an answer but a field of quiet. The colors here don’t need to prove anything. They lift and settle like birds, choosing branches with care. The shapes find their faces and keep them, at least for now. Above you, the blank canvas you first found drifts up and up until it is a moon, full and watchful, a white coin you’ve thrown into the well of the sky. Your younger self yawns, and their outline grows thin as mist.

“Keep the brush,” they say, handing you your own hand. “You can paint your way out of anything. Or into it.”

When you look down, your fingers are empty. The filament of light has braided itself into your heartbeat. You press your palm to the air and leave a faint, luminous print that fades slowly, like a firefly deciding it is enough to have been seen.

Somewhere a door closes without shutting anything in. Somewhere the wind sets the table again. You stand in the world you’ve helped make and let the strangely faithful silence gather around your ears, and in that quiet, the dream picks you up lightly, like a parent lifting a sleeping child, and carries you forward.
