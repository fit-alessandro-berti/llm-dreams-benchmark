try to take a deep breath and calm yourself down, but your emotions keep bubbling to the surface. Your friend is standing across from you, their face flushed with frustration. The room around you feels distorted, as if the walls are bending and twisting in and out of focus. You decide to pause for a moment and say, "I don't want us to fight like this. Let's try to figure this out together."

Your friend's expression softens, but suddenly, the scene shifts. You're no longer in the room. Instead, you're both standing on the edge of a vast cliff overlooking an endless ocean. The air is heavy with the scent of saltwater, and the sky is a swirl of vivid colors—pink, gold, and deep purple—as if it’s both sunrise and sunset at the same time.

Your friend reaches out, pointing to something in the distance. "Look," they say, their voice calmer now but still tinged with urgency. You follow their gaze and see a small, glowing orb floating over the water. It's pulsating faintly, as though it's alive.

"That’s it," your friend says, their tone resolute. "That’s what we’ve been arguing about. That’s why all of this happened."

Without fully understanding what they mean, you feel an intense pull toward the orb. You take a step closer to the cliff's edge. The ground beneath your feet begins to crumble, and you feel a rush of adrenaline. Your friend grabs your arm and holds you back.

"You can't get to it alone," they say. "We have to do this together."

You hesitate, feeling conflicted. Do you trust them after the fight you just had? Do you believe you can set aside your differences? The orb’s glow intensifies, and the ocean below begins to churn, waves crashing violently against the rocks.

What do you do?
