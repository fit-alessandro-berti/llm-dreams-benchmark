As you move deeper into the maze, the walls shift and twist, their surfaces pulsing faintly with an Otherworldly glow. The air hums with an eerie resonance, as if the maze itself is alive, watching you. The puzzles grow more perplexing, each one a test of your very mind.  

Your first challenge is a wall of mirrored panels, each reflecting a different scene: a desert, a forest, a city. But the reflections move *independently*, as if guided by a hidden force. You realize the puzzle requires you to *step into the reflections*—to follow the path of the shifting images, not the wall. As you do, the mirrors align, revealing a hidden corridor behind them.  

The next puzzle is a riddle etched into the floor: *“I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?”* You ponder, then answer, *“An echo.”* The floor lights up, and the walls dissolve into a spiral staircase, leading upward.  

Deeper in, the maze becomes a labyrinth of shifting gears and interlocking rings. Each ring is labeled with a celestial body: Sun, Moon, Saturn, etc. To advance, you must align the rings so their gears turn in harmony. You calculate the angles, the gravitational pulls, and the rhythm of the stars. The gears spin, and the maze tilts, revealing a passage that spirals into the void.  

Then comes the final chamber: a vast room with no walls, only a central sphere suspended in air. The sphere pulses with a soft, rhythmic light, and at its core, a single question appears in glowing script: *“What is the one thing you’ve always denied yourself?”*  

You feel the weight of it. The answer is not a puzzle but a truth—*the fear of failure, the doubt that held you back*. You release the fear, and the sphere explodes into a cascade of light. The maze shatters around you, and you wake up, breathless, in your bed, the walls of the dream still echoing in your mind.  

But as you glance at the clock, it’s only 3 a.m. And your hand is still tingling where you touched the sphere.
