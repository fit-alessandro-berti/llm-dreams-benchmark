You start to frantically check your pockets – nothing. Even in the dream, you know they’re empty. Panic begins to prickling at the corners of your chest. Rain slicks the obsidian streets of the city, reflecting the sickly yellow glow of unseen lamps. Buildings twist and writhe at precarious angles, constructed from polished bone-white material. The air is thick with the scent of decay, blooming jasmine laced with brine. 

You look around. Hundreds of tiny faces, blurred and shadowed like watercolors left in the rain – are they judging, questioning? – and no one seems to notice you, or you, for that matter. You try calling out, "Excuse me!" – and simply hear a muffled echo returning, distorted somehow. 

Then you see it. A single, perfectly circular cart pulled by a creature cobbled together of shifting shadows and rusted metal – it’s gliding silently toward you. As it approaches, imprinted onto the side is *number 47*. It doesn’t match any license plate, any address you’ve ever seen. It just *is*.  And etched into the cart’s side in tiny, glowing runes are words you can't quite understand, feeling like half-remembered lullabies sung in a dead language.

Despite your desperate attempt at a memory to retrace your steps, your mind remains a blank fog. The meeting – you realize with a stomach-lurching dread – you’re supposed to be meeting *the Clock Master* about a prophecy involving a lost seed. The stakes are immense. 

Hesitating, you feel an odd compulsion to follow the cart towards a towering, constantly rearranging tower – an obsidian spire clawing at the perpetually grey sky. Around its base, scattered in intricate patterns of polished quartz, are dozens of perfectly balanced stacks of stones, each containing a single, glowing violet shard. As you approach, you start to *feel* – a pull, a compulsion – drawing you closer, a whisper calling your name that seems to resonate from *within* your own soul.  You reach out, your fingers brushing against the cool, slick surface of one of the stones and a sliver of intense light erupts beneath your hand, revealing fleeting images – distorted faces of others, a marketplace overflowing with impossible produce, a cavern filled with weeping waterfalls. The feeling overwhelms you – you *know* you’re next. Your meeting awaits. But just as you are pulled towards the spire, a laugh echoes from deep beneath the earth, and you realize that the city isn’t *for* you. It was *built* by you.

Okay, that's a longer one and leans towards being a little surreal! Let me know if you'd like me to refine it or continue developing it.
