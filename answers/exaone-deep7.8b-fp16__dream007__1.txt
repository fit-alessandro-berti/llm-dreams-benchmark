**Continuing the Dream:**  

You stand neck-deep in the argument, your voice shaking as you shout, "You *never* listen!" across the room where your friend leans against the doorframe, arms crossed, eyes blazing. The air hums with tension, the kind that makes sweat drip from your forehead.  

**Setup of the Disagreement:**  
The root of your clash? A months'-long betrayal your friend felt but never spoke. They’d seen you withdraw after a crisis last year, your quietness branded as coldness, while you’d felt the silence to be a death sentence. Now, years old, they snap, “You ghosted us then, didn’t even *say* anything!” You retort, “Silence’s what you kept *from* saying. You’d rather I be a ghost than... *see* you?”  

**Escalation:**  
History floods your mind—the night you stayed up until dawn to avoid your sister’s apology, the way your friend lingered at your door that night, heart poundin’, fists clenched. Your tone sharpens. “You *lied* about the project. Called me a loser when you doubted my skills.” They spatterize, "You think I *want* to fix your ego?"  

The room thins, shadows pooling like wet ink. A storm brews outside—the one your friend always said would never come. The door slams, echoing your declaration.  

**Climax:**  
Your friend’s voice cracks. "I was scared. What if you decided *you’d* leave?" They look away, avoiding your gaze. You turn, searching the empty space where their smile used to be. "Then let’s *end* this."  

Silence. Then a hesitation, as if the years mean something. Finally, they whisper, "We can... keep trying."  

**Resolution:**  
You think of the storm—it’s already passed, the ground still damp with its remnants. The friend’s hand drifts toward yours, but pauses. The door opens, and they step inside, silence thick but not awkward. For the first time since your childhood, you let a tear fall. "We’re still here," you say, faintly.  

They nod, slow. The dream lurches forward, but you feel the weight of years unspoken, the story still lingering like a shadow—half-seen, half-relied upon.  

**Final Image:**  
You’re back in your room, the argument now a dream fragment. You stash the shattered figurine on your desk—a relic of a friendship lost and fought to regain. The storm’s echo fades, leaving a single drop of rain on your laptop screen.
