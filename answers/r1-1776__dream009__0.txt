**Dream Continuation:**

...find a way to survive. The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth, and the cobblestone streets beneath your feet are uneven, worn smooth by generations of travelers. A horse-drawn cart clatters past, its driver eyeing your strange clothing with suspicion. You glance down—coarse woolen pants and a linen tunic replace your pajamas. *When* are you? 

A weathered sign creaks in the wind: *"Ye Olde Tavern, 1723."* 18th-century England, then. Panic rises, but you force yourself to think. Your modern knowledge is useless here—no electricity, no GPS, no antibiotics. Yet fragments of history class float back: plagues, witch trials, the Enlightenment simmering beneath the surface. 

A woman in a mud-spattered apron shoves a bucket into your hands. "Stop gawkin’ and fetch water from the well, unless you fancy starvin’!" Her accent is thick, but her urgency is clear. You obey, blending in. At the well, you overhear whispers: a child in the village is deathly ill, and the local midwife has been accused of cursing the family. Superstition hangs heavy, and you recall the grim fate of "witches" in this era. 

But you also remember basic first aid from a long-ago camping trip. Could you help? The risk is immense—if you fail, they’ll blame you. If you succeed, they might fear your "magic" all the same. Yet the child’s faint cries echo from a nearby cottage. Your hands tighten on the bucket. 

As you hesitate, a shadow falls over you. The blacksmith’s daughter, her arms scarred from the forge, meets your gaze. "You’re not from here," she murmurs. "But neither am I." She nods toward the woods, where a crumbling stone circle glints in the distance. "The old ways remember. Maybe… we don’t have to be trapped here." 

The dream fractures—**do you follow her into the trees, risking the unknown? Or stay and fight the village’s fear with fragile science?** The choice flickers like candlelight, and the world dissolves into smoke.
