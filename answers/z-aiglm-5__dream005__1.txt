...realize that with every step you take, the layout of the room shifts, stretching the distance between you and your friend like an elastic band.

You approach a cluster of people laughing uproariously, but as you get closer, the sound dampens into a low, metallic hum. They are holding glasses that seem to be filled with liquid mercury. When you try to ask if they’ve seen the person you know, they turn to you in unison, their faces slightly blurred, as if smeared with Vaseline. They point toward a doorway that wasn’t there a moment ago.

Stepping through, the atmosphere changes from a cocktail party to a dense, indoor forest. The carpet has become moss, and the chandeliers are hanging fruits. You spot the back of your friend’s head in the distance, but they are walking impossibly fast, gliding over the ground. You try to call out, but your voice produces no sound—only bubbles that float from your mouth and pop silently in the air.

Finally, you push through a thicket of velvet curtains and find yourself in a small, quiet room. Your friend is sitting alone at a table for two, waiting. They look up, smile warmly, and slide a puzzle piece across the table toward you.

"You're late," they say, their voice clear as a bell. "But right on time."

The dream dissolves into a feeling of immense relief as you reach out to take the piece.
