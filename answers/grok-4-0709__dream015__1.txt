You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to rebuild—not just a shelter, but a garden of impossible dreams. The soil is cracked and poisoned, irradiated from the fallout of whatever cataclysm scorched the earth, but you kneel down anyway, your hands trembling as you plant seeds you've scavenged from the ruins of an old botanical lab. These aren't ordinary seeds; in the haze of your dream, they glow faintly, whispering promises of fruits that could heal the sick and vines that might ensnare the roaming mutants.

As you work, shadows flicker at the edges of your vision—bandits with eyes like shattered glass, or perhaps just the wind howling through skeletal skyscrapers. You ignore them, focusing on the first sprout that pushes through the dirt, unfurling leaves that shimmer like liquid silver. Word spreads somehow, in that dream-logic way, and survivors begin to trickle in: a mechanic with gears for fingers, a child who speaks to ghosts, an elder who remembers the old world's songs. Together, you fortify the garden with barricades of twisted metal and hope, turning it into a sanctuary where water flows from hidden springs you swear weren't there before.

But dangers lurk closer than you think. One night, under a sky streaked with unnatural auroras, a colossal shadow descends—a beast born from the apocalypse, its body a patchwork of rusted machines and feral flesh. It charges, and in the chaos, you grab a vine from your garden, which writhes to life in your grasp, growing thorns that pierce the monster's hide. You fight, not with weapons, but with the essence of renewal, until the creature dissolves into mist, leaving behind a cache of glowing artifacts.

As dawn breaks, the garden blooms wildly, flowers opening to reveal portals to other worlds—lush forests, bustling cities untouched by ruin. You step toward one, heart pounding, but just as your foot crosses the threshold, the dream shifts. The ground trembles, and you realize it's all unraveling. You wake up in your bed, sweating, the echo of post-apocalyptic winds still rustling your curtains. Or do you? The room feels... off. A single glowing seed sits on your nightstand. Was it ever just a dream?
