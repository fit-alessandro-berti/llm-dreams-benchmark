...to build a garden.

The idea comes to you not as a grand, heroic plan, but as a quiet, stubborn whisper in the back of your mind. While others scavenge for canned goods and rusted weapons, you start collecting different things. You find a half-shattered ceramic pot and carefully mend it with wire and dried sap. You pocket a handful of wrinkled, desiccated apple seeds from an old, skeletal orchard. You save the cloudy water from the morning dew, collected on a scrap of corrugated steel.

Your garden begins in that single pot, a defiant little square of green in a world of gray and brown. You place it on the windowsill of a crumbling building you call home. The first sprout, a fragile tendril of life, feels like a greater victory than any scavenged can of beans.

Soon, one pot becomes five. You clear a small patch of earth behind the building, painstakingly picking out shards of glass and twisted metal, enriching the soil with whatever compost you can make. You aren't just growing food—though the tough, bitter greens and stunted root vegetables are a precious supplement. You are growing beauty. A wildflower that somehow took root, its purple petals a shocking burst of color against the dust. A sprig of mint whose scent on your fingers reminds you of a world before.

People notice. At first, they scoff. "A waste of water," they mutter. But then a young girl, her face perpetually smudged with dirt, brings you a single bean she found, her eyes wide with a question. You show her how to plant it. An old man, who barely speaks, starts leaving buckets of relatively clean rainwater by your plot. He doesn't say why. He just does.

The garden doesn't solve everything. Raiders are still a threat, the winters are still harsh, and the gnawing hunger is a constant companion. But it becomes a focal point, a tiny, thriving ecosystem of cooperation and hope. It is a quiet rebellion. You are not just surviving the apocalypse; you are reminding yourself, and anyone who sees your garden, what you are surviving *for*.

You are dreaming of a reason to live, and in the dream, you are planting it, seed by stubborn seed.
