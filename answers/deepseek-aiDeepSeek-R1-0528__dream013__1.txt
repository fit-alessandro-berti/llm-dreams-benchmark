The air grows colder as you descend a spiral staircase carved from obsidian, the final puzzle of the previous chamber echoing in your mind – a shifting lattice of light that required visualizing four-dimensional rotations. You step into a vast, circular chamber bathed in an eerie, sourceless blue light. The walls are seamless, polished black stone, reflecting the light like dark mirrors. In the center stands a single, waist-high pedestal made of milky quartz.

On the pedestal rests not a puzzle, but an **impossibly complex, three-dimensional labyrinth sculpted from pure crystal**. It’s the size of a large melon, its internal pathways glowing with faint, shifting colors – crimson, emerald, sapphire – bleeding through the facets. Tiny, intricate symbols are etched onto the crystal surfaces at seemingly random intervals: spirals, intersecting triangles, glyphs resembling fragmented equations.

**The Puzzle Presents Itself:**

1.  **The Maze:** The crystal labyrinth isn't static. As you watch, sections of it *rotate* with a soft, grinding hum. Walls slide, bridges form and dissolve, dead ends open into new paths. It’s a dynamic, evolving puzzle.
2.  **The Goal:** Deep within the shifting core, you see a pulsing point of pure white light. That must be the key... or the exit trigger.
3.  **The Symbols:** The etched symbols aren't decoration. As sections of the maze rotate, specific symbols align momentarily with fixed points on the pedestal base – points marked with corresponding, but inverted, symbols.
4.  **The Reflection:** This is the true challenge. The polished black walls aren't just walls; they are *active mirrors*. When you look directly at the crystal maze, its complexity overwhelms you. But when you focus *only* on its reflection in the dark wall beside you... the perspective shifts. The reflection shows the *inverse* of the maze's internal structure – the paths become voids, the walls become channels of light. Crucially, the symbols in the reflection appear *corrected*, no longer inverted.

**The Logic Unfolds:**

*   **Direct Observation is Deceptive:** Trying to navigate the maze by looking directly at it is futile. The shifting paths and the inverted symbols create impossible contradictions.
*   **The Reflection Holds the Key:** The mirrored view reveals the *true* navigable paths (as light channels) and displays the symbols in their intended orientation.
*   **Alignment is Everything:** To unlock a stable path to the core light, you must manipulate the rotating sections of the *physical* crystal maze *while simultaneously observing the reflection*. You need to rotate a section until the symbols etched on its *physical* surface align correctly with their counterparts on the pedestal base. Only when the *physical* alignment is correct does the *reflected* path in the mirror solidify into a stable, traversable route towards the core.
*   **Sequencing:** This alignment must be done sequentially. Each correct alignment stabilizes a segment of the path in the reflection. One misalignment, and the entire reflected path dissolves, forcing you to restart the sequence.

**The Solution Requires:**

1.  **Intense Dual Focus:** Your eyes constantly flick between the physical crystal (to manipulate the rotation knobs subtly embedded in the pedestal) and its reflection in the dark wall.
2.  **Symbol Deciphering:** Quickly recognizing which symbol on the rotating section needs to align with which fixed point on the base, using the corrected reflection as your guide for what "correct" looks like.
3.  **Spatial Reasoning:** Understanding how rotating the physical piece affects the *inverted* path structure shown in the reflection. Moving a wall left in reality moves the light-channel right in the reflection.
4.  **Perfect Timing & Memory:** Remembering the sequence of alignments needed to build the stable path segment by segment, as the maze continues its slow, background shifting.

**The Breakthrough:**

After agonizing minutes of failed attempts, frustration mounting like the cold in the chamber, you force yourself into a state of hyper-focused calm. You fix your gaze solely on the reflection. You let your peripheral vision guide your hands on the rotation knobs. You stop *thinking* about the physical maze and *become* the navigator within the reflected light-path. You see the sequence: *Align the Spiral with the Vortex. Then the Fractured Equation with the Summation Glyph. Then the Twin Triangles with the Intersecting Lines...*

With each precise alignment guided by the reflection, a section of the glowing path in the mirror solidifies, burning brighter. Finally, after aligning the seventh symbol – a complex glyph that resolves into a perfect circle in the reflection – the entire path to the pulsing white core stabilizes into a brilliant, unwavering beam of light within the dark mirror.

A resonant *chime* fills the chamber. The crystal labyrinth on the pedestal flashes brightly, then turns perfectly transparent and inert. The white light within winks out. Simultaneously, a section of the seamless black wall opposite the mirror silently slides open, revealing a descending corridor filled with warm, golden light and the faint scent of ozone and old paper.

You step towards the new opening, the cold of the blue chamber receding. The puzzles are clearly escalating, demanding not just logic, but a complete inversion of perspective. As you cross the threshold, the maze seems to shift subtly behind you, readying the next impossible challenge. The golden light beckons, promising deeper mysteries ahead.
