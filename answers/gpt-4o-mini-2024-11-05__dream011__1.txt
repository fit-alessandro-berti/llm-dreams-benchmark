completely unfamiliar. The first question asks you to solve a complex mathematical equation that you’ve never seen before, and you start to feel a wave of panic. As you skim through the rest of the exam paper, you realize the questions seem to be a strange mix of advanced topics, some of which you’ve never even studied. One question is written entirely in a language you don’t understand, and another requires a series of dance moves that you’ve never practiced.

You glance around and see other students confidently scribbling answers, but you feel frozen, unsure of what to do. Suddenly, the clock starts ticking faster, the hands moving in a blur, and you have no idea how much time you have left. You try to calm yourself, but the pressure builds.

Then, just as you’re about to give up, you hear a faint voice telling you to trust your instincts. You take a deep breath, close your eyes for a moment, and when you open them again, the questions have changed. They are now directly related to your passions and strengths, and you start answering them with ease. But, in the back of your mind, you still feel the rush of anxiety, wondering if this dream is testing you in ways you can’t yet comprehend.
