...as you approach it, the swirling horizon seems to pause, as though the entire world is holding its breath. The canvas is impossibly white—not just absent of color, but absorbing it, pulling the shifting hues from the air like a gentle tide.  

You reach out, and before your fingers touch it, the surface ripples like water. Images begin to bloom across it, not drawn by any hand, but as if they are *remembered* into existence. A golden spiral unfurls, becoming a path of floating steps that extend out from the canvas and into thin air.  

With each step you take onto this staircase, your body feels lighter, your hands turning translucent and threaded with tiny constellations. You glance over your shoulder and realize that the world below is also changing—the rivers are running backwards, the clouds are folding in on themselves like origami.  

The staircase ends at a door, free-standing in the air. It is the color of a dream you almost remembered upon waking, but not quite.  

When you turn the handle, a rush of scent—fresh rain on warm stone—pours out, and you hear a voice on the other side whisper your name, though it sounds like it’s being spoken by *you* from a place far in the past.  

Do you step through?
