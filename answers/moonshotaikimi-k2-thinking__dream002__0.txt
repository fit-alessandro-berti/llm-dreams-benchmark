you realize the thunder is coming from inside your chest. Each heartbeat sends a tremor through the trees, shaking loose leaves that shouldn't exist—silver and glass, tinkling like wind chimes against your skin. The sky hasn't darkened so much as turned *away*, refusing to watch what's about to happen.

You run, but your feet find only the memory of running. The path dissolves into photographs of itself, each step landing on a flat, crinkling image of moss and stone. The forest animals appear—wrong. A deer with television static for eyes watches you from behind a tree that's simultaneously fallen and standing. It speaks without moving: "You left the windows open."

The storm isn't approaching. It *unfolds*. Rain falls upward from the ground, soaking the roots of trees that now grow downward from the sky. You remember you're supposed to be somewhere else—were you going *to* something or *from* it? The question turns solid in your throat, a small stone you swallow but can't digest.

Lightning doesn't flash; it *remembers* itself into being, illuminating moments from your childhood that never occurred. You see yourself as a child, opening a door in your bedroom that leads to this exact forest, this exact storm. You've been here before, which is impossible, or you've never left, which is worse.

The wind tastes like copper and forgotten phone numbers. It whispers the end of a sentence you started last Tuesday but can't recall. Your hands begin to fog, matching the mist that isn't rolling in but *remembering* how to be here. The storm is you. You are the forest. The dream is tired of being dreamed and wants to wake up.

You try to scream, but it comes out as weather.
