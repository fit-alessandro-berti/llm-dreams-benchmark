...plant a garden.

Not a practical garden—there's no sunlight worth mentioning, and the soil hasn't seen clean rain in years. But you remember seeing a sealed packet in the ruins of the library, tucked between moldy pages of *The Secret Garden*. You'd carried it in your coat's inner pocket for three months, the tiny seeds clicking like loose teeth.

The spot you choose is absurd: a crater where a missile hit, now filled with rust-colored dust and shards of solar panels. You spend the morning hauling a cracked bathtub from the collapsed clinic, filling it with the finest dust you can sieve through an old window screen. Your fingers bleed, but the pain feels distant, like someone else's story.

That night, you plant three seeds. The instructions on the packet dissolved to pulp long ago, so you just whisper to them—*please*—and give them the last of your water ration.

Weeks pass. You forget whether you're waiting for the seeds or they're waiting for you. Then one morning, a single green filament pushes through the dust, glowing faintly. It's not chlorophyll. It's something else, something that hums when the wind blows right. The other survivors gather, drawn by the rumor of color. They bring offerings: a bottle cap of clean water, a fragment of mirror, a story about a flower their grandmother grew.

By the time the first petal opens—translucent blue, and warm to the touch—you realize the garden isn't growing plants. It's growing *why*. And for the first time since the world ended, you remember that some things are worth surviving for.
