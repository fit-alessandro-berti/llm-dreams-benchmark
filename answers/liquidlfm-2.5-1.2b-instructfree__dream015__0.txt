...reinvent myself.  

I’m a survivor navigating the ruins of what was once my city. The sky is gray, the air thick with dust and silence except for the distant moans of the desperate. My hands are calloused from scavenging what little is left—rusted tools, crumbling supplies, the pieces of old electronics.  

I take my first breath, the air sharp in my lungs, and decide to adapt. I map the ruins, seeking safe spots to build shelter, gather food, and protect what little I have. The hunger is never far, but so is curiosity.  

I find a makeshift workshop in the ashes, where I fashion tools from scrap metal. I learn to carve messages into walls—hopeful signs for others, warnings for those who wander too close. I teach the children me—and myself—about the past, about why we fell.  

But the greatest danger is fear itself. So I walk with a torch, not to search for treasure, but to remind the world that *something* still shines in the dark.  

And maybe, just maybe, something survives.
