Let me continue this dream scenario:

I begin to walk toward the podium, feeling the warmth of the spotlight on my face. But as I reach for my notes, I realize they've transformed into butterflies that flutter away into the auditorium. The crowd begins to shift and ripple like waves in an ocean. When I open my mouth to speak, I'm surprised to find that my voice emerges as beautiful music, painting colorful patterns in the air above the audience. People start floating gently from their seats, and the walls of the auditorium dissolve into a starlit sky. Instead of feeling anxious, I feel a profound sense of connection with everyone present, as if we're all part of the same cosmic dance.

(Since this is a dream sequence, I incorporated surreal and fantastical elements that are common in dreams, where reality bends and transforms in unexpected ways.)
