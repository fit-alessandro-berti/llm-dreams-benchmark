…and each one pulls you a little further away from the ordinary world.

---

The first challenge is announced over invisible speakers.

> “ROUND ONE: CHOOSING THE DOORS YOU DON’T SEE.”

You find yourself in a huge circular room. Dozens of doors line the walls, each labeled with a safe-sounding title:

* “Stable Position”
* “Good Benefits”
* “Respectable Career”
* “Something in Your Field”
* “Maybe This Is Fine”

Other doors have no labels at all—just bare wood, or metal, or glass so fogged you can’t see through.

The other contestants rush to the labeled doors, arguing and pushing, hands already on the knobs. The room shakes like it might collapse if you don’t pick quickly.

In the middle of the room stands a small podium with a slip of paper. You pick it up.

> “Your dream job is behind a door you can’t justify to anyone but yourself.”

You look around. Every labeled door suddenly feels too small, too pre-written. Your gaze catches on a narrow, unmarked door tucked between “Stable Position” and “Good Benefits.” It’s almost apologetic, like it’s sorry for existing.

You hear your own voice in your head: *If this is a dream, I might as well be honest.*

You go to the unmarked door and turn the handle.

The room goes silent. The lights flicker. You step through.

On the other side is Challenge Two.

You’re in an interview room, but the interviewers are all… you. Different versions:

* You at 10 years old, legs swinging, eyes bright.
* You now, but tired, with a laptop under your arm.
* You from some future that hasn’t happened yet, with gray at your temples and a calm you don’t recognize.

They sit behind a desk with your résumé in front of them, but it’s blank—just your name at the top.

Future-You folds their hands.
“Tell us why you’ve been pretending not to know what you want,” they ask.

You try to answer like a normal interview. Something about skills, experience, market demand. The words feel dusty the moment they leave your mouth.

Ten-Year-Old You interrupts.

“What did you like doing *before* you started worrying about whether it ‘made sense’?”

You open your mouth, and instead of words, images spill out in your mind:

* The feeling of losing track of time in something you’re building/creating/solving.
* The satisfaction of explaining something and watching a face light up with understanding.
* The small thrill when someone trusts you with a problem and you actually fix it.

The room fades around you as you speak, and the blank résumé fills itself in—not with job titles, but with verbs:

> “Designing, Building, Explaining, Connecting, Solving, Caring, Guiding…”

Present-You, the tired one, leans forward.

“Okay,” they say. “Now tell us what you *don’t* want anymore.”

The words come easier this time:

> “I don’t want to feel replaceable.
> I don’t want work that’s only impressive on paper.
> I don’t want to be good at something I don’t care about.”

The future version of you smiles faintly, like you finally answered the only question that mattered.

A stamp appears in their hand. They press it onto the paper.

> “QUALIFIED.”

The interview room melts away like scenery being pulled offstage.

Challenge Three.

You’re in a huge auditorium filled with people. Contestants stand on a brightly lit stage, each stepping up to a microphone to describe their dream job in precise, polished language. Their answers sound like they’ve been rehearsed for weeks.

You’re handed a microphone, but when you look down at your cue card, it’s blank.

The host’s voice booms:

> “FINAL ROUND: DEFINE THE JOB THAT DOESN’T EXIST YET.”

Your heart hammers. Everyone’s watching. Somewhere, you know, a panel of judges is evaluating you. Maybe it’s the versions of you from the last room. Maybe it’s society. Maybe it’s no one at all.

A timer appears in front of you: 10… 9… 8…

Your mind tries to scramble for something respectable. Something that sounds like a real answer. But the dream won’t let you.

Instead, you hear yourself say:

“I don’t know the title. I don’t know the industry. But I know how it will feel.”

The auditorium goes quiet.

You keep going.

> “In my dream job, I wake up curious, not resentful.
> I use the parts of myself I like best, not just the parts that look good on a résumé.
> I work with people who actually *want* to be there.
> I’m allowed to grow, change, and outgrow even this version of my dream.”

You pause, surprised at your own honesty.

> “So my dream job is… something I’m willing to keep choosing, even on the hard days.
> And if it doesn’t exist yet, I’m willing to help invent it.”

The timer freezes at 00:01.

The crowd doesn’t cheer. Instead, they all vanish, dissolving into faint silhouettes of light that drift away like dust motes.

Only the stage remains. And on the floor where the crowd used to be, a path appears, made of floating words. Each tile is a possibility: “Start your own thing,” “Switch fields,” “Study,” “Apply,” “Collaborate,” “Experiment,” “Ask,” “Risk,” “Rest,” “Try again.”

At the end of the path, you see it: a door with your name on it.

Not your full name like on an official document. The name you use when you’re being honest with yourself. The one you hear in your head when you think, *This is who I am when nobody’s watching.*

---

The host’s voice returns, softer now, coming from everywhere and nowhere.

> “FINAL TASK: STEP INTO A FUTURE YOU HAVEN’T PROVED YOU DESERVE YET.”

You walk the path. Each word you step on glows under your feet. *Apply. Ask. Risk. Learn. Build. Try. Fail. Try Again.*

At the door, there’s no handle—just a small slot and a note:

> “INSERT ONE BELIEF ABOUT YOURSELF YOU’RE WILLING TO CHANGE.”

You reach into your pocket and pull out a small, folded slip of paper. You don’t remember putting it there, but you know what’s written on it even before you unfold it:

> “I’m not the kind of person who gets to have their dream job.”

Your chest tightens. For a second, you think you might turn back.

But somewhere behind you, you hear the voices of your other selves:

* “You don’t have to be ready,” says Future-You.
* “You just have to be honest,” says Present-You.
* “You just have to start,” says Ten-Year-Old You.

You slide the paper into the slot.

The door unlocks with a soft click.

Inside is not some glamorous office or studio or perfect workplace.

It’s… a small, sunlit room with a big messy desk. On the walls are notes, sketches, plans, ideas, half-finished things. Some are brilliant. Some are clearly failures. None of them are hidden.

On the desk is a contract.

At the top, in bold letters:

> “EMPLOYMENT OFFER: YOUR DREAM JOB”

You scan it, expecting long legal paragraphs, but there are only three conditions:

1. **You agree to keep listening when your work stops feeling like you.**
2. **You agree to let this dream job evolve as you do.**
3. **You agree to treat yourself as someone worth building a life around, not just a career.**

At the bottom is a line for your signature.

You pick up the pen. Your hand doesn’t shake this time.

As you sign, the room shifts. The walls stretch outward. The desk morphs—maybe into a workbench, a laptop in a café, a classroom, a studio, a lab, a stage. It flickers through possibilities faster than you can name them, finally settling into whatever matches that deep, wordless *yes* in your chest.

You realize the grand prize was never a slot someone else defined.

It was permission to define it yourself.

The competition lights fade. The contract glows once, then dissolves into you, like ink seeping into paper.

You feel a gentle tug, like waking up is just around the corner.

As the dream starts to dissolve, you hear a last echo:

> “You got the job the moment you stopped auditioning for a life you didn’t want.”

And then—

You wake up.

And for a split second, lying there in the quiet, you can still feel your hand holding that pen, the weight of the signature you just gave yourself.
