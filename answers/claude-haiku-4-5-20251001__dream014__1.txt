# The Dream Continues

...and you feel a warm hand gently touch your shoulder. When you turn around, their faces seem to shift and blur like watercolors, but their smiles remain clear and steady.

\ know these streets,\ though you're not sure if they're speaking or if you're simply understanding them. \ with us.\, and strangely, the crowded city begins to transform. The harsh angles soften. The noise becomes music. Each street you turn down becomes more familiar, though you've never been there before—it feels like home somehow.

One of them asks where you're trying to go, and when you open your mouth to answer, you realize you've known all along. It wasn't a physical place you were lost from—it was yourself.

As you speak this realization aloud, the strangers begin to gently fade, but not in a sad way. More like they were always part of you, like they were never separate at all.

The city becomes quieter. Lighter. You find yourself standing in a place of soft, golden light.

And you know exactly where you are.
