…and you say yes before you can think of a reason to be afraid.

They arrive like gusts of warm air through a revolving door—faces soft with concern, hands full of ordinary miracles. One carries a bag of lemons that perfume the street. Another has a ladder slung over a shoulder as if he’s just descended from the sky. A woman in a red coat tucks a tape measure into her pocket, the metal gleaming like a quiet promise. A child’s kite trails along the pavement, its tail catching on shadows and tugging them loose.

“We’ll walk with you,” they say, as if walking were a language you’d forgotten.

You follow, and the city, which a moment ago had been a cliff of noise and angles, begins to bend. The horns soften, the crosswalk lights blink in time with your breath. You learn the rhythm of the block: two cafés, a blue door, a barber’s pole spinning stories of all the heads it has known. The man with the lemons presses one into your palm. “For when the air gets thick,” he says. “Smell and remember there was a tree.”

The child unfolds a map that doesn’t look like the streets at all. It’s a sky, black paper pricked with holes, each tiny aperture leaking daylight. “These are the places we’ve loved,” the child says. “Look. That star is a library with windows like eyes. That one is a bakery where the bread breathes.” You tilt the map and the constellations rearrange themselves into a neighborhood you might recognize—if you could remember when.

They take you down an alley where murals lean close to listen. A painted whale lifts its eye to you; a staircase painted on a wall becomes a staircase under your feet. Laundry strung overhead flaps like flags in a country that welcomes everyone. You are offered a piece of bread from the flour-dusted man you hadn’t noticed before. Steam rushes out like a secret. He breaks the loaf with his hands and gives you the larger piece.

“Tell us where you’re going,” the woman in the red coat says, and you try to answer. You shape the name of a street with your mouth and it falls apart, letters scattering like pigeons. She nods as if this is what she expected. “We’ll ask the city, then.” She pulls out her tape measure and flicks it into the air. It snaps to attention and points, quivering, toward a narrow passage between a florist and a shop that sells clocks with no hands.

“Stairs smell like cinnamon here,” says the man with the ladder, and you all climb. At the landing, a violinist leans in a doorway, bow tucked under his chin, sleep in his eyes. He plays two notes—one for your fear, one for its companion, resolve. The sound hangs like a lantern. You step into it and feel your shoulders lower, your pockets lighten.

Every corner offers a kind of test, but they are gentle ones. A bus kneels for an older woman and you practice kneeling beside it, only to rise again with a better view. You ask a lamppost for permission to pass and it answers with a three-count flicker: yes, yes, yes. A stop sign blushes when it realizes it’s been too harsh, and a man on a bicycle rings his bell just for the music of it.

As you walk, the strangers give you small things you didn’t know you needed. A safety pin, a story about a river that hid under the streets until someone sang its name, a piece of chalk. “Mark the corners that feel like you,” the child says, and you draw a simple symbol on a brick: a circle with a little door.

You come to a square you’ve never seen and have always known. In the center stands a fountain tiled in blue, its water talking in a language you almost remember. The strangers stop. “Listen,” they say. The fountain’s voice arranges itself into syllables that sound like your name, but better—your name without the hurry, without the second-guessing. It says, Here. It says, Welcome back.

There is a door of ordinary wood beside the fountain, one you would have missed if the red coat hadn’t flashed and the lemons hadn’t brightened the air. On the wood is your symbol, the circle with the little door, drawn in chalk you recognize as the chalk in your pocket. You pat your coat and feel something hard at the seam, and the seam gives way. The woman smiles and threads her tape through the tear as if sewing time together. Inside is a small key that tastes like a coin when you put it on your tongue, metallic and electric with rain.

“Go on,” says the man with the ladder. The child’s kite lifts as if catching a wind only dreams remember. The violinist’s bow rests and waits.

You fit the key into the door and it turns with a sigh like a book opening. Behind it is not a single room but a courtyard of rooms, each lit from within. As you pass through, you see pieces of yourself arranged with such kindness it makes you ache: a chair that fits your back exactly, a coat on a peg, a stack of maps you’ve drawn over years of not knowing you were drawing them. The air smells like old paper and rain on pavement, like lemons and warm bread. A window looks out on the city, and the city looks back, not with indifference but with the interest of a friend you’ve finally called.

You turn to thank the strangers, but the doorway holds only the drifting echo of their footsteps. A lemon rests on the sill. The tape measure is looped over a nail, gentle as a scarf. Far off, a violin answers a bird and then becomes the bird and then becomes the traffic and then becomes silence.

You realize you are not found so much as finding, a present tense that leans forward and does not break. You pocket the key, dust your hands with flour, press your thumb into the chalk mark beside the door. The mark smudges onto your skin in the shape of a path.

When you wake—because you do—you taste a brightness at the back of your mouth. Your palm bears the faint outline of a circle with a little door. Outside your window, the city is still bustling, but it is also something else, something that has made room. You step into the day and it steps back to meet you. Somewhere, someone rings a bicycle bell just for the music of it, and without thinking, you ring back.
