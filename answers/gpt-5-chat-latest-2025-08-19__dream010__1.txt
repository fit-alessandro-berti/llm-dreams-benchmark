you notice that they aren’t just testing your obvious skills, but also the hidden parts of who you are.  

Some challenges are straightforward: solving riddles, creating plans, or demonstrating knowledge in your field. Others are far stranger. In one round, you’re asked to climb a winding staircase that has gaps where steps should be. Each gap requires you to recall a moment in your life when you overcame self‑doubt—only then does the missing step appear. In another, you’re placed in front of a mirror, but your reflection begins asking you questions about *why* you want this dream job, not just *that* you want it.  

As you keep going, the competitors around you slowly vanish, until you realize the contest isn’t against them—it’s against your own sense of limitation. At the final stage, you stand before a large sealed door. Etched across it are words that seem to shift: *“What will you give, and what will you keep?”* 

You sense that if you open the door, your dream job lies beyond, but what you choose to leave behind will shape how you walk through it.  

What do you decide to set down at the threshold, and what do you carry with you through the door?
