...realize your hands are made of smoke.  

You stare at them—translucent, swirling gray tendrils curling from your wrists like breath on a winter morning. You try to grasp your coffee mug, but your fingers pass through it, leaving ripples in the liquid. Panic flares, but it’s muffled, dream-distant.  

Your boss stands at the end of the cubicle aisle, a silhouette with a clock for a head. The hands spin wildly. *Tick-tick-TICK*. “*The blueprint,*” their voice echoes, not from the clock but from the ceiling tiles. “*Where is the blueprint?*”  

You open your drawer. Instead of files, it’s filled with origami cranes made of ticking stopwatch hands. One flutters out, landing on your smoky palm. It unfolds, and the metal strips rearrange into a map—a labyrinth of hallways that weren’t in the office yesterday. At its center, a pulsing star: *the blueprint*.  

You stand up, and the floor softens. Your feet sink into carpet that flows like black water, pulling you toward the labyrinth’s entrance. Doors sprout from the walls, each marked with a different time: *10:07 PM. 3:15 AM. Yesterday.* You choose *10:07 PM*.  

Inside, the room is your childhood bedroom. Moonlight stripes the walls. On the bed sits the blueprint—a blueprint of a star going supernova, drawn in crayon. As you touch it, your smoke-hands solidify. You feel paper, wax, heartbeats.  

The clock-headed boss winks from the window. “*Late,*” they sigh, but their voice sounds almost proud. “*But present. That’s the only deadline that matters.*”  

You wake up at your desk. The project folder is empty. Your hands are flesh. But in your pocket, wax-residue glows warm. And for the first time, you’re not afraid of the ticking.
