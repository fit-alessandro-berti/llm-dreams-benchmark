As the group of kind strangers approaches, one of them, an elderly woman with warm, wrinkled eyes, steps forward and asks, "Are you alright, dear? You look lost."

Before you can respond, a young man with a friendly smile hands you a map of the city. "Here," he says, "maybe this will help. Where are you trying to go?"

You glance at the map, your eyes scanning the intricate web of streets and landmarks. You're not sure where you are or where you're going, but something about the map catches your eye—a small, faded symbol in the corner. It's a drawing of a lighthouse, and it feels strangely familiar.

"I think I'm looking for a lighthouse," you say, pointing to the symbol.

The elderly woman's eyes light up. "Ah, the old lighthouse! It's been abandoned for years, but it's a beautiful place. We can help you find it."

The group huddles together, discussing the best route. They decide to lead you to the nearest subway station, which will take you closer to the lighthouse. As you walk, the city seems to transform—the bustling streets become quieter, the buildings less towering, and the air feels fresher.

You arrive at the subway station, and the group helps you navigate the ticket machine. As you wait for the train, the young man who handed you the map pulls out a small notebook and pen. "Here," he says, "write down your number. I'll check in on you once you get to the lighthouse, make sure you're safe."

You take the notebook and pen, jotting down your number. The train arrives, and the group helps you board. As the doors slide shut, you wave goodbye to your new friends, feeling a warmth in your chest that you haven't felt in a long time.

The subway ride is uneventful, and eventually, you arrive at the stop closest to the lighthouse. As you exit the station, the air is crisp and salty, and you can hear the distant sound of waves crashing against the shore. You follow the sound, guided by the faint glow of the lighthouse beam cutting through the night sky.

Finally, you arrive at the lighthouse. It's old and weathered, but there's a certain charm to its simplicity. You climb the winding stairs to the top, and as you step out onto the platform, you can see the entire city sprawled out before you. The lights twinkle like stars, and for a moment, you feel like you're standing on the edge of the world.

Your new friends were right—the lighthouse is a beautiful place. And as you look out at the city, you realize that you're not alone after all. There are people out there who care, who will help, if only you let them.

You pull out your phone and dial the number the young man gave you. As the phone rings, you can't help but smile, knowing that even in the vastness of the city, you've found a place where you belong.
