…each group feels like a strange little world of its own.  

The first one is a circle of people standing unnervingly still, all holding empty champagne flutes and gazing up at the chandelier as though waiting for it to drop. When they glance at you, their eyes glint like the crystal above, and you excuse yourself quickly.  

In the next group, you hear laughter like wind chimes. A woman in a green velvet dress is telling a story, but the words come out as vivid, shifting images suspended in mid-air — a fox leaping over a fence, a wave curling into a spiral, a clock melting in her hands. No one else reacts. One of the images brushes your shoulder and feels warm.  

You move on. A cluster of men in identical gray suits are playing an invisible card game; their hands move swiftly, but nothing is there. Occasionally, one of them nods solemnly as if a great gamble has just been won or lost.  

Passing through more groups, you realize you can never quite see anyone’s face for more than a heartbeat — they blur or melt into someone else. You begin to wonder if you are losing your ability to recognize people at all.  

At last, you spot your friend across the room. They are smiling at you, but they are surrounded by strangers in masks shaped like birds. Before you can reach them, the floor shifts subtly, like the deck of a ship at sea, and your friend begins to drift away through the crowd as if carried by a gentle current.  

You try to follow, but every step leads you into yet another unfamiliar circle of people, each focused on something you cannot perceive. Your friend’s figure grows smaller, until you can only make out the glint of their eyes — and for a terrible moment, you wonder if they were wearing a bird mask all along.  

Would you like me to **continue the dream into a resolution** or **let it end here as an unresolved feeling**?
