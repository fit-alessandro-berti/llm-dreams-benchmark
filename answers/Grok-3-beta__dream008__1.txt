feel a wave of panic rising in your chest as you stare at the mountain of papers and files piling up on your desk. The clock on the wall seems to tick louder with every passing second, mocking your inability to even know where to begin. Your boss, a stern figure with arms crossed, looms in the doorway, their eyes boring into you with an unspoken demand for immediate action. 
Suddenly, the room begins to shift. The walls of your office melt away, replaced by a vast, open field stretching endlessly under a twilight sky. The papers on your desk transform into a flock of birds, spiraling upward and scattering into the air. Your boss is no longer there—instead, a gentle breeze whispers encouragement, urging you to run. You take off, your feet barely touching the soft grass, feeling lighter with every step. The impossible deadline fades into a distant memory as you realize you’re no longer bound by time or expectation. 
Ahead, a shimmering lake appears, its surface reflecting a thousand stars. You dive in without hesitation, the cool water enveloping you like a comforting embrace. Beneath the surface, you discover you can breathe effortlessly, and the world below is alive with vibrant colors—coral reefs of ideas, schools of fish darting like fleeting thoughts. You swim deeper, unafraid, until you reach a glowing orb pulsating with energy. As you touch it, a voice echoes through the water: “The project is yours to shape, not to fear.” 
You awaken—not in the dream, but in that hazy space between sleep and reality—feeling oddly refreshed, as if the impossible had just become possible.
