You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air grows heavy with tension. The sky, once a soft blue, darkens into a swirling mass of violet and gray. A low rumble echoes through the trees, and the wind picks up, howling like a wounded beast.

Leaves swirl around you, and the ground beneath your feet trembles as if the earth itself is holding its breath. Then, without warning, the first raindrops fall—cold, sharp, and strange, shimmering like liquid silver in the dim light. They don’t just wet you; they seem to hum against your skin, carrying whispers in a language you almost understand.

As the storm intensifies, the trees begin to shift. Their trunks twist and stretch, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. The path you were on vanishes, replaced by a labyrinth of glowing fungi and bioluminescent vines that pulse with a rhythm like a heartbeat.

In the center of it all, a figure appears—a tall, shadowy being with eyes like twin moons. It doesn’t speak, but you feel its presence in your mind: *“You have entered the realm between dreams and memory. What do you seek?”*

And as the storm rages on, you realize this is no ordinary dream… this is a test. And you must choose.
