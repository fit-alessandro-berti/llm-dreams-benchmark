and you realize the fluorescent lights are humming like a swarm of bees. The wall clock has melted into a puddle that reflects a sky full of calendar pages. Your boss stands at your desk, earnest and expectant, but their face keeps folding and unfolding like a Post-it note. The project—already stamped in bold red across your monitor—blooms into a physical thing: a paper plane the size of your forearm, its wings scored with deadlines.

You reach, and the keyboard keys lift like stepping stones, spelling out directions you don't remember learning. The printer coughs up a ladder of invoices; the coffee machine begins to pour out tiny suns. Someone in Accounts morphs into a librarian with a fox's tail who hands you a tiny spool labeled "extra time" and a needle that hums like an engine. The impossible deadline is not a sentence but a zipper running down the sky; when you tug at it the stars unzip into a cascade of spare hours that look like origami cranes.

You don't panic. In the dream there is always another tool. You thread the needle with a memory of your best work, stitch a seam between Tuesday and Friday, and sew a pocket of "now" into your pocket. Your boss, still made of paper and polite expectation, smiles and unfolds into a map. Coworkers turn into guides—one becomes a tide that carries reports forward, another kneads out solutions like bread dough. You learn to fold meetings into airplanes and send them to the trash bin, to staple problems into small, manageable shapes.

When you finally sit, the impossible deadline is smaller—light as confetti—because you have divided it into tasks that sing when done. You begin, not by sprinting to finish, but by trimming the task into something you can hold, and by threading a line of calm through the chaos. The office breathes. The clock agrees to tick at your pace. And if the dream knows its own rules, the moment you find a rhythm, the deadline dissolves into a margin note that reads: "Good start."

Somewhere between the stapled mountains and the coffee-sun, the boss nods, folding back into a human shape that looks almost relieved. You keep working, and the world rearranges itself around the steady, small acts of finishing. Then a warm hand—your own—taps your shoulder and wakes you.
