…you hesitate for just a second, because in dreams you always know when something feels too good to be true. But their eyes are warm, their voices soft, and the city around you keeps swirling like watercolor in rain, so you nod.

The tallest one, a woman with silver hair that moves like moonlight on water, smiles and takes your hand. The moment her fingers touch yours, the noise of the crowd fades into a low, gentle hum. Streetlights blink out one by one, as if someone is dimming the world to help you see better.

“We know the way,” she says, “but you have to choose which way you want to go home.”

The others fan out, each standing beneath a different-colored doorway that definitely wasn’t there a moment ago:

- A red door pulsing like a heartbeat.
- A blue door rippling like the surface of a deep lake.
- A golden door humming with distant music.
- And one small, plain wooden door that looks exactly like the front door of the house you grew up in, except it’s standing alone in the middle of the street.

The silver-haired woman squeezes your hand. “Pick one,” she whispers, “and we’ll walk you all the way there. No matter how far.”

You realize you’re not afraid anymore. You’re curious. Excited, even.

You step forward, reach out, and the instant your fingertips brush the doorknob of the door you’ve chosen…

…you wake up in your own bed, heart racing, sunlight pouring through the curtains, with the strangest certainty that if you ever do get lost again (really, truly lost), those strangers will be waiting under the next streetlamp, ready to walk you home.
