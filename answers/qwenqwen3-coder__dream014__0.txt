...feel a warm sense of relief wash over you. Their faces blur slightly, like they're half-formed from mist and kindness, but their voices are clear and genuine.

"You look like you could use a friend," one of them says, and somehow you know they understand that you're lost in more than just streets - you're searching for something deeper, something you can't quite name.

They don't ask questions about where you're going or why you're alone. Instead, they simply walk with you, their presence filling the empty spaces in your chest. The city noise fades into a gentle hum, and for the first time in what feels like forever, you're not afraid of the vastness around you.

One stranger shares their sandwich with you, another points out a hidden garden tucked between towering buildings where flowers grow defiantly through cracks in the concrete. A third begins to hum a melody that stirs something familiar in your memory - a song from childhood, or maybe from somewhere you've never been.

As you walk together through the dreaming city, you realize you're not just finding your way home. You're finding your way back to yourself, guided by the unexpected kindness of people who appeared exactly when you needed them most.

The dream grows softer at the edges, and you wake up feeling less alone.
