Okay, drifting deeper into the dream...

...the air goes still and heavy, thick with the smell of ozone and damp earth. The birdsong abruptly ceases, replaced by an unnerving silence that presses in on my ears. Looking up, the gentle blue sky is being swallowed by churning clouds the colour of bruises – deep violet, angry grey, shot through with sickly green.

The wind hits first, not a gradual build-up but a sudden, violent shove that rips leaves from the branches and sends them swirling around me like frantic confetti. It howls through the trees, a low, mournful sound that seems to have substance, pushing against my chest. The temperature plummets, goosebumps rising on my arms despite the sudden urge to run.

Then, the thunder. It doesn't just rumble in the distance; it cracks *overhead*, a physical vibration that resonates deep within my bones. With the thunderclap comes the first flash of lightning, momentarily bleaching the forest in stark white and revealing trees bent at impossible angles, their branches like skeletal fingers clawing at the sky.

Rain begins, not as gentle drops, but as cold, heavy pellets striking my skin, instantly soaking my clothes. It's coming down too hard, too fast. The forest floor, moments ago soft loam and moss, is quickly turning into rivulets of mud.

I need shelter. My eyes dart around frantically. The familiar, peaceful path I was on seems to have vanished, replaced by tangled undergrowth. Panic starts to bubble in my chest. Another flash of lightning illuminates a peculiar sight ahead – an ancient, gnarled oak tree, far larger than any other, with a hollow at its base that glows faintly with a soft, inviting amber light. It seems impossibly safe, impossibly warm amidst the growing fury of the storm.

Against the wind's relentless push and the stinging rain, I stumble towards it, the strange glow pulling me in, unsure if I'm running *from* the storm or *towards* something else entirely... The entrance to the hollow seems to hum slightly as I get closer, the sound almost, but not quite, drowning out the tempest behind me.
