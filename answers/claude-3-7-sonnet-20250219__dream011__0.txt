# The Impossible Exam Dream

You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language you don't recognize. The symbols shift and morph on the page, refusing to stay still long enough to decipher.

Your heart pounds as you look around the room. Everyone else is writing furiously, their pencils making confident scratching sounds against paper. How do they understand what you cannot?

You flip through the pages, hoping to find something familiar. On page three, there's a question written in your language: "Explain how you prepared for a test you didn't know was coming."

Suddenly, you realize you're in the wrong classroom. You gather your things to leave, but the door has disappeared. The walls seem to be moving inward. The ceiling grows taller.

The proctor, who now has the face of your childhood pet, announces: "Five minutes remaining."

You try to write something—anything—but your pencil turns to sand in your fingers. The desk beneath you begins to tilt. Your chair is now made of marshmallow, slowly sinking toward the floor.

A window appears where there wasn't one before. Outside, you see a landscape from your hometown, but the trees are upside down, their roots reaching toward a purple sky.

The exam paper folds itself into an origami bird and flies away just as the proctor calls, "Time's up!"

You wake with a start, your real alarm clock blaring, with the lingering feeling that you've forgotten something important about today.
