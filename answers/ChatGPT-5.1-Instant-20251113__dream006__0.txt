You try again. This time, your words turn into shimmering shapes—tiny glass birds—that flutter out over the crowd. They hover above people’s heads, catching the stage lights, then burst into soft chimes that rain down like music.

The audience applauds wildly, not with their hands but with a rising wind that you can feel pushing gently at your chest. It lifts you an inch off the stage. You realize you’re floating, weightless, and the crowd is too, rising with you like a constellation being pulled into the sky.

Someone in the front row calls out—not with a voice, but with a thought you somehow hear: *“Tell us more.”*

And so you inhale deeply, preparing to speak again, feeling the next impossible thing forming on your tongue…
