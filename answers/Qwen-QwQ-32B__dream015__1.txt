... venture into the crumbling ruins of the old city, guided only by a flickering lantern and the faint hum of a Geiger counter tucked into your pocket. The air smells of rust and burnt ozone, and the skeletal remains of skyscrapers pierce a sky choked with ash. Your boots crunch over glass shards as you step into what was once a library, now a labyrinth of collapsed bookshelves. Among the debris, you find a leather journal half-buried under a fallen statue of a winged lion. Its pages are filled with equations scribbled in hurried handwriting:  
$$ E = mc^2 \cdot \sin(\theta) + \int_{-∞}^{∞} f(x) dx $$  
and a sketch of a compass rose labeled *“The Last Equation.”*  

Outside, a low growl echoes. Through a crack in the wall, you see them—scavengers with plasma-cutters, their eyes reflecting the crimson glow of the horizon. You freeze, but then notice one of them drop a pendant: a silver key shaped like a DNA helix. When you reach for it, the journal’s final page flips open, revealing coordinates etched in radioactive ink.  

Do you:  
1. Flee with the key, trusting the coordinates later?  
2. Confront them, armed only with the journal’s riddles?  
3. Hide, but leave a trail leading to a buried cache of supplies you’ve stockpiled for months?  

The wind howls, carrying whispers that sound like static—or maybe a voice reciting prime numbers.
