…panic as your pockets turn up nothing but lint and a crumpled business card with no address. You pull out your phone only to watch the map swirl and spin, streets rearranging themselves like a kaleidoscope every time you blink. A passer‑by laughs in a language you almost understand and points you down an alley that seems to stretch longer the faster you walk. Street signs melt into each other, skyscrapers loom and lean at impossible angles, a bus stops with your name on its display but it's filled with empty chairs.

You try to run but your legs feel stuck in syrup, then suddenly you're on a bicycle, then in a taxi whose driver turns around and has your own face. "You'll be late," he whispers, but the clock on the dashboard flashes nonsensical symbols instead of numbers. Staircases lead down into the sky, the meeting room is on the twenty‑third floor of a building that disappears when you look directly at it.

Heart pounding, you burst through a revolving door into a lobby made of mirrors. Every reflection is you, dressed for every meeting you've ever had. In the middle of the floor sits a lone table with a chair. The chair is empty. A voice over the intercom calls your name, echoing from everywhere and nowhere at once. Just as you sit down, breathless, realizing you are both the one expected and the one doing the expecting, the alarm on your nightstand shrieks, and the city dissolves into morning light.
