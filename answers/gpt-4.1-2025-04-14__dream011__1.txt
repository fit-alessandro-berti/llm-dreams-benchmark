written in a language you don’t recognize. The symbols squiggle and dance across the paper. You look around the room, but everyone else appears calm, hunched over their tests. You try to recall if you studied these symbols or ever saw anything like them before, but your memory feels hazy and distant, as if it’s dissolving.

Your pencil turns heavy and warm in your hand. When you touch it to the paper, the symbols shift into doodles of places you half-remember—your childhood home, a tree you once climbed, a path into the woods under moonlight. A strange certainty washes over you: maybe these aren’t exam questions at all. Maybe you’re meant to draw, not answer.

The instructor walks by, their face blurry and hard to focus on. They nod and whisper, “Just follow where it leads.” Emboldened, you let your pencil flow. The lines connect—the images form a story only you understand. The room fades around you, and suddenly, you are no longer sitting at a desk but walking down the woodland path from your drawing, sunlight dappling the ground, your future unwritten and full of possibility.
