**...realize the walls are shifting behind you, sealing off paths you’ve already taken. The air hums with a low vibration, as if the maze itself is alive, observing your every move. Each puzzle you solve feels less like a barrier and more like a question: a riddle carved into stone, a sequence of glowing symbols that rearrange themselves when you blink, a door that only opens if you *stop* thinking about the answer.**  

**As you press deeper, the challenges grow unnervingly personal. A hallway lined with mirrors reflects fragmented versions of yourself—some familiar, others grotesque or alien. One mirror shows a childhood memory, another a fear you’ve never confessed. The puzzle here isn’t logic—it’s confronting what stares back. You clench your fists, breathe, and step through the glass, the shards dissolving like smoke.**  

**At the maze’s heart, you find a final chamber. The ceiling spirals into a fractal abyss, and at its center floats a single, ordinary key. But the platform beneath it crumbles unless you solve the paradox etched into the floor: *“To wake, you must forget. To survive, you must remember.”* The key trembles as you reach for it, morphing into a question: *Who are you when no one is watching?***  

**You hesitate—then pluck the key from the air. The maze collapses. You fall, not downward, but *inward*, until you land in a quiet room you’ve never seen, yet somehow know by heart. A clock ticks backward on the wall. The door behind you vanishes.**  

**You wake up.**  

**But the key is still in your pocket. And the clock is still ticking.**

*Dreams are the mind’s labyrinth. Sometimes, the exit is a door you didn’t know you carried.*
