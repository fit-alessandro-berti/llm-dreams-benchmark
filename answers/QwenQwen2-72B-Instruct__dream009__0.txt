You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to adapt quickly to survive in this unfamiliar world. You find yourself in the heart of an ancient forest, walking past giant trees that are much older than you. The air feels fresh and serene, and the only sounds that infiltrate your ears are the rustling leaves, the flitting of birds, and the occasional howl in the distance. You look around, trying to locate some people or signs of civilization. 

Eventually, a narrow trail brings you to a small, prehistoric village. You see crude, wooden huts and people dressed in animal skins, indicating that you've somehow time-traveled to the Stone Age. Both confused and intrigued, you carefully approach the villagers, introducing yourself with gestures and sounds since you share no common language. They seem friendly enough and invite you to join them in their daily activities.

You get to learn the basic skills of survival from the villagers. They teach you how to make fire using flints and dry grass, how to hunt using spears, how to forage for edible plants, and how to craft simple tools out of stone. You, in turn, try to teach them a few of your skills – like basic counting, drawing, and other simple inspirations that might help them overcome their difficulties.

Many days go by, and you grow accustomed to this simple yet harmonious way of life. You especially enjoy the close connection nature provides and the peace of living without the relentless pace of modern society. You eventually realize that while the modern era offers conveniences you initially took for granted, this time period teaches you the importance of community, resilience, and a deep bond with the world around you.

As you immerse yourself in the Stone Age's daily routine and culture, you also keep trying to find a way back to your own time. You begin to wonder whether you stumbled upon a portal, or if your supremacist perception in modern science has awakened a previously untapped connection with universal energy. Whatever the reason, time and result remain unknown.

One night, as you stare up at the stars, lost in memorization, a bright light appears in the sky, illuminating the forest. The light seems to form a tunnel, pulling you in. Before you can react, you wake up, back in your own time with a heart full of new experiences, wisdom, and a secret wonder you can't quite put into words. The villagers, the lessons you learned, and the life you lived in the past seem like a part of you, a tale from a distant world, carrying elements of reality and the surreal. And in your heart, you carry a faint hope that one day, you will return to the place of your second origin, in the vast expanse of a time beyond your own.
