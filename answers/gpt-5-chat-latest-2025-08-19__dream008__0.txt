…look down at your desk to find stacks of papers that weren’t there a moment ago, rising higher and higher like towers of white cliffs. The floor shifts beneath your chair, and suddenly your office expands into an endless warehouse of cubicles stretching to the horizon. Your boss is still watching you, but now their eyes glow faintly, like two tiny desk lamps.  

You reach for a pen, but instead of ink, it pours out streams of luminous blue light onto the page, shaping into diagrams and words on their own, almost faster than you can comprehend. The papers flutter as if alive, rearranging themselves into origami birds that take flight, circling your head and whispering faint instructions in voices that sound oddly familiar—like echoes of your own thoughts.  

The deadline clock on the wall begins to tick louder and louder, hands spinning faster until the numbers blur. In a surge of determination (and perhaps desperation), you realize that you don’t need to “finish” the project at all. Instead, you only need to dream it into existence. Each idea you imagine forms instantly, sketching itself across the glowing pages like reality bending around your will.  

Your boss leans closer, their lamp-like eyes softening, and says (without moving their mouth): *“This is what we wanted all along.”*  

And just as the last paper folds itself into a bird and disappears into the wide, dream-sky above the cubicles, the walls of your workplace dissolve into rushing waves of light. The impossible deadline is gone, replaced by an infinite expanse of time.  

Would you like me to continue this dream toward something uplifting and freeing—like a lucid escape into adventure—or toward something more mysterious and surreal?
