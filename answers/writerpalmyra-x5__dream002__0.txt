The air turns heavy and still, like the world is holding its breath. Then—a flash, blinding white, splits the sky. Thunder crashes so loud it vibrates in your chest. The treetops whip wildly as wind surges through the canopy, and rain begins to fall in thick, slanting sheets.

But something’s off.

The raindrops glow faintly as they hit the forest floor, sizzling like embers. The path ahead begins to shimmer, unraveling like wet thread, revealing not soil beneath, but something smooth and glass-like, reflecting a sky you don’t recognize—three moons hanging low, one cracked down the middle.

You hear a voice, not in your ears but in your bones, whispering: *“You were never supposed to wake up.”*

Your heart pounds. Do you step forward onto the glass path… or turn back?
