enchanted symbols etched into the surface, shimmering slightly as if they were alive. Curiosity piqued, you run your fingers over the design, and suddenly, the locks click open with a soft, mechanical whirring. As the box opens, a pulse of vibrant light emanates from within, blinding you momentarily before revealing its contents.

Inside the box, you find a single page of parchment that has been written in an ancient, yet familiar script. The page is blank, save for one mysterious sentence carved across its center:

"Seek the Starlit Serpent, and all will be revealed."

The box and the parchment vanish with a soft whoosh of air, leaving you standing in a field under a starry night sky. You look up, scanning the heavens for any sign of a serpentine figure or a unique star pattern, but you can find nothing obvious.

As you make your way back to the place where the mysterious box appeared, you realize that the field is now surrounded by a dense, shimmering forest, the gateway to your next adventure. The trees seem to be whispering ancient secrets as they glow faintly in the moonlight, and you feel a strange, yet familiar tingling sensation coursing through your veins.

You're excited to unravel the mystery of the Starlit Serpent, determined to follow the cryptic clue and discover what lies ahead.
