You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak. But instead of your prepared words about innovation and the future, your mouth opens and out pours a torrent of opera—rich, booming arias in a language you don't recognize, your voice echoing like Pavarotti on steroids.

The audience leans in, mesmerized at first, then starts humming along, their faces morphing into glowing masks of approval. You try to stop, to pivot to your notes, but your arms have turned into feathery wings, flapping wildly as you launch into a high C that shatters the spotlight bulbs above. Confetti rains down—not paper, but tiny glowing fireflies that swarm around you, forming words in the air: "ENCORE!"

Panic rises as the stage tilts like a funhouse floor, and the front row stands, revealing they're all versions of yourself—mini-mes in tuxedos, nodding furiously. You flap harder, soaring up to the rafters, but the microphone cord yanks you back, wrapping around your ankles like a mischievous snake. The crowd chants your name (or is it "biscuits"?), and just as you're about to plummet—

You jolt awake, heart pounding, tangled in sheets, the alarm blaring. Was it a nightmare or the best TED Talk ever?
