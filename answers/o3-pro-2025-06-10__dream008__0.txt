…feel every muscle tense. The cubicle walls stretch upward like skyscrapers, the fluorescent lights begin pulsing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, and your computer screen looms over you like a stadium scoreboard demanding results. 

You take a breath, place your fingers on the keyboard—only to see the keys liquefy into quicksilver. Letters drip down your wrists, pooling in your palms as shimmering symbols. Your boss clears his throat. When you look up, his suit has turned into a stopwatch. Instead of a face, ticking hands whirl behind glass.

“I need the whole thing before lunch,” the stopwatch says, its voice echoing like an announcement in a vast station. “And lunch is already half-gone.”

Panic spikes, but then you remember: this is a dream. The moment the thought clicks, gravity loosens its grip. You rise from your chair as though the air itself has become warm sea water. Papers spiral around you like gulls. The office dissolves into a chalk outline of itself, drawn over a sky that’s glowing twilight blue.

You snap your fingers. The melted letters in your hands soar upward, rearranging into constellations that spell S O L U T I O N across the ceiling. The stopwatch-boss tilts, trying to follow them, but time slips out through the crack at the edge of the second hand and pools on the carpet like mercury. With another snap, the puddle turns into a silver path leading to an open door that wasn’t there before.

Beyond the door: a calm shoreline under an amber sunrise. Desks bob gently on waves like little rafts, each one already holding a perfectly finished version of your project, stamped APPROVED in bright gold ink. You step onto the nearest raft, pick up the polished report, and turn around.

The stopwatch is now only an ordinary wristwatch, lying motionless on an empty swivel chair. You tuck it into your pocket—just in case a reminder of time might be useful later—then let the tide carry you onward. Sunlight warms your face, and a breeze whispers: Deadline met, dreamer. Deadline met.

The scene blurs, the waves fade, and you wake with a smile, realizing you can tackle whatever real-world project the day brings—without bending the laws of physics… or at least not quite as much.
