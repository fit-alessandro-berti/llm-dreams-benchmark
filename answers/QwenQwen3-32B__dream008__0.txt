You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you… you feel the air thicken, the clock on the wall ticking backward. The project? A 10,000-page manuscript to be written, formatted, and bound by sunrise—but it’s already midnight. Your boss, whose face has melted into a smooth, featureless white, gestures toward your desk, where a single blank page floats in midair, pulsating like a heartbeat.  

You sit down, but the keyboard dissolves into sand as you touch it. Panic rises. Then, from the shadows, your coworkers emerge—except they’re made of paper, their limbs fluttering like origami. One tears off its arm and hurls it at you. “Just mimic the motions,” it whispers. “The *typing* doesn’t matter. It’s the *sacrifice*.”  

The deadline looms. You frantically stab at the air, “writing” paragraphs that vanish as quickly as they form. The room grows colder. Your boss’s voice echoes, hollow and amused: “You *knew* this would happen. You always leave things for the last minute.”  

Then—a click. The page stops pulsing. A cursor blinks, waiting. You realize, with a dizzying lurch, that the manuscript isn’t about *content*… it’s about *confession*. Every typo is a truth you’ve buried. The formatting? A reckoning of your lies.  

As dawn approaches, you begin to type—not what they want, but what *you* need. The walls shudder. The paper coworkers crumble into ink, which pools at your feet. The page fills, not with words, but with a mirror. Your boss leans in, now a reflection of your younger self, and smiles.  

The alarm clock rings. You wake, gasping, in your chair—real or not, the ache of unfinished work still clinging to your fingers.
