As you step through the castle’s crumbling archway, the air grows colder, and the shadows seem to pulse like living things. The guardian blocks your path, their voice a low rumble: *“To break the curse, you must face the truth it hides. What is the one thing this village fears more than ruin?”*  

You remember the villagers’ whispers—how they avoided the forest, how the bandits mirrored their own faces. It hits you: the curse wasn’t born of magic, but of **fear**. The village had exiled a group of their own long ago, accusing them of witchcraft. The “bandits” were survivors, twisted by hunger and hatred, haunting the woods to exact revenge. The guardian, you realize, is the spirit of the first exile—a healer who tried to save the village from a plague but was cast out. Her death cursed the land, blending guilt and vengeance into a cycle of suffering.  

You kneel, not in fear, but in respect. “The village needs to *remember*,” you say. “Not as victims, but as the architects of this curse.” The guardian’s eyes dim, and the shadows part, revealing a rusted mirror embedded in the castle floor. It reflects not your face, but the village’s history—the exile, the plague she could have stopped, the slow decay of trust.  

When you return to the village, you gather the people at the forest’s edge. You tell them the truth. At first, they recoil, but then—a elder steps forward, recognizing a symbol on the mirror as an old remedy for disease. Together, you dig up the healer’s forgotten herbs, cure the lingering sickness, and send a delegation into the woods to beg forgiveness.  

The bandits, stunned by the offering, lower their weapons. Over time, the forest grows lighter, the air sweeter. The village thrives again, not by erasing the past, but by rewriting it.  

As for you? One morning, you wake in your own bed, but the scent of pine and earth lingers on your hands. On your windowsill sits a single, withered herb—a reminder that even in dreams, the past shapes the future.
