…and you notice that their hands are glowing faintly, like paper lanterns held close to the body, pulsing in rhythm with your own heartbeat. When you take the offered hand—callused, warm, impossibly light—you feel the city’s noise dim to a distant murmur, as though someone has turned down the volume of the world.

They don’t consult maps or phones. Instead, they begin to walk in a spiral, and you realize the streets are rearranging themselves around your footsteps. Cobblestones ripple like water; skyscrapers bow gently to let sunlight through. One stranger—wearing a coat made of autumn leaves that never fall—whispers that being lost isn’t the absence of location, but the presence of becoming.

You follow them through an archway that wasn’t there a moment ago, into a courtyard where the air tastes like childhood and rain. Here, the strangers turn to face you, and their faces shift: now your grandmother, now a version of yourself from years ago, now a face you haven’t met yet but somehow recognize. They place a compass in your palm, but instead of north, the needle points toward your sternum, spinning faster until it melts into your skin.

“You were never alone,” the leaf-coat stranger says, their voice echoing from inside your own chest. “You were just gathering the scattered pieces.”

The city begins to dissolve at the edges, softening into golden static. You feel yourself lifting—not flying, but unraveling into light, each thread of anxiety becoming a star. The strangers wave, but their hands are now your hands, raised in a mirror you didn’t know you were holding.

You wake with the taste of copper and honey on your tongue, the compass-pulse still thrumming beneath your ribs, and for a moment, the ceiling above your bed looks like an open sky waiting to be mapped.
