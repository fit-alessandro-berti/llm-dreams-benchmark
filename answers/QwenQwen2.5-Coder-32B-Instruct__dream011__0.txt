As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language you don't recognize. Panic sets in as you realize you missed the memo about a new curriculum and this unexpected language barrier could jeopardize your chances. 

You quickly scan the room, hoping to find someone familiar who can help, but everyone else is frantically scribbling away in their own copies. The proctor, a stern-looking woman with a clipboard, gives you a warning glance and you sink further into your chair, heart pounding.

What do you do next? 

Do you try to decipher the language as best as you can, guessing at the questions and answers? Do you raise your hand and admit you have no idea what's going on, hoping the professor will take pity on you? Or do you let fear take over and stare blankly at the paper, your mind blanking out the inevitability of failure?
