...written in a language you've never seen before, with strange symbols that seem to shift and dance on the page. Your heart pounds as you realize you're completely unprepared - not just for the content, but because you can't even read what's being asked.

You look around the exam room and notice something odd: all the other students are calmly writing answers, their pens moving confidently across their papers. Even more unsettling, when you glance down at your own hand, you see it's not your hand at all - it's translucent, like you're viewing it through water.

Suddenly, the exam booklet flips open by itself, and the pages begin to turn rapidly. Each page shows a different scene from your life - moments you'd forgotten, choices you made years ago, people you hurt without meaning to. The questions, you realize, aren't testing your knowledge of a subject, but your understanding of yourself.

The proctor, a figure whose face keeps changing between people you've known and strangers, announces there's no time limit. "Take as long as you need," they say, their voice echoing strangely. "But remember - some questions can only be answered when you're ready to hear them."
