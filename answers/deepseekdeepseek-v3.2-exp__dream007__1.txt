...take a deep breath and step back. The anger is a hot, red pulse behind your eyes, and your friend's face is a mask of similar frustration. You can feel the next, more cutting retort forming on your tongue, a sentence you know you can't take back.

But instead of speaking it, you let out a long, slow breath. The tension in your shoulders eases just a fraction.

"I think," you say, your voice quieter than you expected, "we're both too upset to talk about this productively right now. I don't want to say something we'll both regret."

Your friend looks startled, the angry script interrupted. There's a moment of heavy silence.

"This matters too much to our friendship to ruin it with a shouting match," you continue. "Can we just... take ten minutes? Go for a walk, separately, and cool down? Then we can try again."

The anger in your friend's eyes softens into reluctant acknowledgment. They nod, shoving their hands in their pockets. "Yeah. Okay. Ten minutes."

You turn and walk in opposite directions. The dream's scenery shifts around you, the harsh lines of the room blurring into a quiet, misty park. The silence isn't hostile anymore; it's thoughtful. You're not stewing in your rightness, but instead, you're trying to piece together *why* they feel so strongly, seeing the issue from their side of the table.

When you meet again on a park bench, the heat is gone. The argument isn't over, but the war is. You're ready to listen.
