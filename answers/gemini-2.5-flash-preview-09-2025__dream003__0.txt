You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and realize they are not mere decoration, but an unbelievably fine script드 language that predates memory.

The script pulses with a low, internal light, shifting colors from deep amethyst to pale gold. As your fingers trace the cool metal등hich feels like petrified starlight듮he symbols vibrate, causing a phantom echo in your chest.

You realize the lock is not a latch, but a silence. To open the box, you must disturb the silence in a specific, perfect way.

Focusing intently, you lean closer. The light from the box blooms outward, washing the surrounding landscape등hich moments ago was a dim, mossy clearing들n brilliant, impossible blues. The patterns on the box begin to hum, the sound feeling less like noise and more like a resonant truth being whispered directly into your marrow.

One particular symbol, shaped like a labyrinthine ear, flares brightest. You understand, instantly and without logic, that the key is a tone. It is a single, forgotten frequency that exists only in the spaces between thoughts.

You close your eyes and breathe the dust of the dream. You don't try to sing; you try to *recall*. You delve into the deepest well of your mind, past the noise of waking life, until you find that pure, original sound듮he sound of nothing becoming something.

When you exhale, the sound is not audible to the ear, but rather felt as a wave of absolute stillness.

The moment the perfect resonance touches the box, the internal pulsing stops. The colors vanish, leaving the metal obsidian black. There is a click, not of tumblers falling, but of perfect alignment.

The box does not physically open. Instead, the top surface becomes liquid, shimmering like oil on water, then collapses inward, folding dimensionally into itself until it is nothing but a frame surrounding an infinite, deep emerald space.

Inside the box, resting on a bed of crystallized shadow, is not a jewel, or a map, or a hidden message.

Inside the box is a single, clear, glass tear.

As you reach out to touch it, the tear begins to fall듯pward. It floats out of the box, catching the impossible blue light, and dissolves just above your palm.

And when the tear is gone, you realize that the box contained the only thing it could:

***The memory of how to feel this surprised.***

The box snaps shut, regaining its patterns, and the clearing plunges back into the gentle, expectant darkness of the dream. You hold the echo of the surprise in your hand, and for a moment, you remember everything you뇼e forgotten.
