... feel a sudden wave of dread. Your throat tightens, and your palms grow clammy despite the cool stage lights. The microphone amplifies your first words, but they come out as a shaky whisper. The crowd leans forward, straining to hear. You open your mouth to speak again—and your voice cracks entirely. A hush falls over the auditorium.  

Panicking, you glance at the podium, but your notes have vanished. The screen behind you flickers, displaying a garbled mess of symbols. Suddenly, the floor tilts beneath your feet. The audience’s faces morph into abstract shapes: some into stern judges, others into familiar strangers. A child in the front row raises their hand, mouthing, *“Can you start over?”*  

You inhale deeply, and the air smells like burnt toast and possibility. When you exhale, the spotlight above you dims, replaced by a constellation of tiny stars. To your surprise, your next words flow without notes, without fear—just raw honesty about the terror and thrill of standing there. The crowd leans in, now silent but attentive. A single clap echoes from the back, then another, swelling into a wave.  

As the dream fades, you realize the speech wasn’t about the words at all. It was about the space between the cracks.  

*(What did you make of that twist?)*
