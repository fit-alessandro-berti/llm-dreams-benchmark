…as you move deeper into the maze, you notice the walls themselves begin to breathe.

Not metaphorically. The stone pulses faintly, like the inside of some colossal lung. The puzzles grow stranger: no longer gears and levers, but living riddles that whisper questions directly into your skull. One asks you to solve for the weight of a promise you once broke. Another demands you arrange the shattered fragments of a childhood memory into a working clock that ticks backward.

The deeper you go, the more the maze seems to recognize you. It rearranges corridors based on regrets you never voiced. A hallway stretches infinitely when you try to run from something you did at seventeen. A dead-end blooms into a door only when you finally admit—out loud—that you were afraid.

At the center, there is no Minotaur.

There is only a mirror.

And in the mirror stands every version of you that gave up too early. They watch silently as the final puzzle forms in the air between you: a single sentence, glowing like molten gold.

“What will you become if you stop solving yourself like a problem and start living like an answer?”

The walls hold their breath.

Your move.
