**…you realize you need to…**

You drift up from a thin, wool‑spun mattress onto the cool stone floor of a hall lit only by firelight. The air smells of damp earth and smouldering oak, and a faint draft tickles the ancient tapestries that line the walls.

There is no clatter of metal or the soft hum of electricity—just the steady crackle of the hearth and the low, far‑off murmur of voices chanting in a tongue you almost know. You glance down at yourself and see a simple linen tunic, a leather belt, and a wooden staff that feels as though it had been grafted to your very soul. A small, copper‑crowned pin rests at your throat; its inscription is a single word, *Aeternum*.

A door of heavy oak swings open, and a figure steps through. He is an older man, his hair white like the embers of a dying fire, his eyes sharp despite the lines that run deep around them. He pauses at the threshold, the weight of his footsteps echoing on the flagstones.

“Child of the wandering,” he says, his voice as soft as the rustle of parchment. “You have come through the Veil of the Timeless. The world you knew has slipped over the cusp of this age, and the hour has turned.”

He gestures you to follow him. You obey, the staff thumping lightly against the floor with each step. The hallway unwinds into a grand courtyard, where a stone fountain churns with clear, icy water. Around it, people move in garments of wool and fur—some with spears, some with loom shuttles, and a few with simple wooden bows. Children dart between the legs of the elders, their laughter ringing like wind through reeds. The whole scene seems paused at a moment when a new season is about to begin — the soil, dark and ready, waits for the sowing of the first seed.

“Your arrival is no accident,” the older man continues as he stops beside a low, carved altar bearing a cracked stone tablet. The tablet bears a single line in the ancient script of the land: ***Eo nollum, velorum.*** *“When the night falls, the world awakens.”*

He looks at you, and you can see the flicker of an old, faint power within his eyes. “You carry the Light of the Dreamers.” He steps back, drawing a thin parchment from his satchel, its edges cracked but still legible. “To return, you must first hear the songs of this age and learn the language of its stones. Only then can you find the Gate that bridges worlds.”

He places the parchment in your hand. You feel a subtle warmth spreading from his fingers into the paper, as if the scroll itself holds a living ember. The words are simple, yet they pulse with something deeper:

> **Find the Whispering Oak at the edge of the river.**  
> **Speak the ancient name you hear on the wind.**  
> **Let the river carry the truth to the stones.**  

A soft breeze brushes past you, pulling the dry scent of pine into your nose. The river— you realize— is not a trickle at all but a wide, silver ribbon that glints in the moonlight, winding beyond the courtyard and disappearing into the forest.

Your mind is a swirl of confusion and awe. The modern world feels like a phantom now, an echo fading with each breath you take in this old air. Yet, amidst the fear, a spark of curiosity ignites. If you can grasp the rhythm of this place, perhaps you can find a way home—or maybe discover a new path that ties both worlds together.

The older man inclines his head, a silent accord passing between you. With the ancient staff, the copper pin at your throat, and the fragile yet stubborn parchment, you step forward onto the cold stone beyond the courtyard. The night deepens, stars spilling their ancient light over the thatch‑topped roofs and distant hills.

Your dream‑walk has begun. The whispers of the forest call, the river waits to carry your words, and somewhere in this age, a gate forged of stone and song holds the promise of returning you—or of letting you remain, forever a bridge between two worlds.
