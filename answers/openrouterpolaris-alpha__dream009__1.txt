…survive the week, or you’ll never wake up.

The thought doesn’t arrive in words. It enters you like a cold draft: an understanding. It doesn’t feel symbolic or poetic. It feels like a rule.

You sit up.

The bed is a straw mattress on a low wooden frame. Your fingers find splinters along the edge. Your body feels too clear—no phone glow in your eyes, no distant electric hum, just the thud of your heart and the slow creak of the building as it settles.

Outside the small window: a pale sky; roofs of dark wood shingles; a wisp of smoke rising from a stone chimney. No glass in the window, only oiled parchment stretched taut, turning the world into a watercolor blur. Your breath fogs it.

You swing your legs over the side. Your bare feet meet cold plank floor. Your clothes have changed: rough linen shirt, laces instead of buttons; heavy wool trousers; your own hands, but nicked and a little calloused, as if you’ve been living here longer than a night.

A smell reaches you: woodsmoke, damp earth, animal, something boiling. You hear voices outside—words in a language you recognize but twisted by accent, vowels softened and dragged. Somewhere, a hammer striking metal, slow and steady. A horse snorts.

You stand, and the room sways for a moment. The sense returns: Survive the week.

You start listing, automatically:

- Water.
- Food.
- Shelter.
- Safety.
- Information.
- Not getting burned as a witch or conscripted or robbed blind.

You push open the door.

The hallway is narrow, crooked, beams blackened with age. At the far end, stairs lead down. You pass a small niche with a wooden carving of a saint staring at you with astonished eyes, as if he can see that you don’t belong.

Downstairs is an inn.

You can tell by the arrangement without ever having seen it outside of movies: heavy tables, benches, a stone hearth pulsing with orange coals, a woman with forearms like tree branches pouring something dark into mugs, a man asleep in the corner, head on folded arms. Light falls in dusty shafts. No glass anywhere—horn panes, parchment, open shutters.

Heads turn when they see you.

“Up at last,” the woman behind the counter says. Her voice is hoarse but not unkind. The accent presses the words together. “You’ll be wanting something hot.”

You nod, because you don’t know what you’re supposed to say. She slaps a clay bowl of porridge in front of you, thick and steaming.

“Thank you,” you say.

The man at the nearest table barks a laugh. “Listen to the court manners on this one.”

They’re watching. Weighing. You meet their eyes briefly, then lower your gaze, remembering every survival tip you never thought you’d use: don’t stand out, don’t boast, watch and listen first.

You eat. It’s coarse, salty, astonishingly good.

“Best keep close to town today,” the innkeeper says, wiping a mug with a cloth so worn it’s more hole than fabric. “Roads aren’t safe. Not with the levies and all.”

You latch onto the word. “Levies?”

She squints at you. “You take a blow to the head yesterday, or are you playing stupid to dodge the captain?”

You choose carefully. “It’s… fuzzy.”

Something in your tone convinces her. Her shoulders soften, just a fraction.

“Well. King’s men are riding through,” she says. “Taking who they need. Boys with both arms, mostly. You’re—” She frowns. “How old are you?”

“Twenty-three,” you say, because it’s what you are, and you hope that’s either clearly too old or too useful.

“Old enough,” a voice says behind you.

You turn.

The man is lean, in worn leather, the red and blue of his tabard faded but still unmistakable. A sword at his hip, hand resting loose on the hilt. His eyes are sharp. He’s been listening.

Your heart trips.

“I’m not from here,” you blurt. “I’m just passing through.”

Wrong move. His interest sharpens.

“From where?” he asks.

The room is too quiet. You feel the edge of something: this is one of those questions that, answered wrong, will crack the dream open in the worst way.

You pick a place you saw on the handmade map by the door. “From the north. Over the ridge path.”

“Name?”

You tell him your real name. He repeats it, rolls it in his mouth, tastes the foreignness.

You feel the rule in your bones, again: Survive the week.

You can’t do that in a warband.

“I’m a scribe,” you add quickly, surprising yourself. “I read. I write. Numbers.” You make a motion in the air, lines and loops invisible on invisible parchment.

Something flickers in his gaze. “Do you now.”

People who can read are rare here, you realize. Rare enough to be valuable. Rare enough to be dangerous.

The innkeeper snorts. “He was babbling like a drunk pilgrim last night. You sure he can hold a pen?”

You latch onto that. Last night. So this version of you has a backstory you didn’t live.

You must look convincingly uncertain, because the captain—if that’s what he is—smiles thinly.

“Come to the square before noon,” he says. “The reeve will want to see if you’re lying. If you are…” He lets the rest hang as he turns away.

The rule: Survive the week.

If you’re useful, they’ll keep you close. If they keep you close, you might avoid the worst dangers, or walk right into them.

When he’s gone, the innkeeper leans in.

“If you can do what you say, you stand a better chance in the reeve’s hall than in the levy lines,” she mutters. “But don’t be clever. They don’t like clever. ‘Specially not in a stranger.”

You nod. “Thank you.”

She studies you more gently now. “You best remember anything else you forgot before noon, hm?”

You step outside.

The air is crisp, damp with last night’s rain. You stand in a dirt street lined with timber-framed buildings. Chickens scatter around your feet. Two kids kick a bundled rag between them. A dog limps past, uninterested.

Above, nothing but sky. No power lines. No trails of airplanes. Just a lark twisting on the air, singing like it’s the only thing it was ever made to do.

You feel horribly, beautifully exposed.

You start walking.

You need:

- A sense of the year.
- The local power structure.
- Currency, if there is any.
- A reason you’re here that doesn’t get you hanged.

At the crossroads stands a weathered post with three carved hands pointing in different directions, and beneath them, something nailed to the wood. You step closer.

It’s a proclamation, thick with rhetoric about loyalty to the crown, border skirmishes, conscription. The script isn’t quite any script you know: letters slant differently; some shapes wrong. And yet—you can read it.

The words slide into sense in your mind like your brain is auto-updating to the font of another century.

Seven days, it says, for all able men of the region to present themselves.

Seven.

You almost laugh.

“See something amusing?” a voice asks at your shoulder.

You hadn’t heard him approach.

This one is older, dressed in dark wool, a ring of iron keys at his belt: the reeve, you guess, or someone like him. His eyes have the weight of a man who measures grain and blood with the same tired precision.

“I can read this,” you say, before you can stop yourself.

He looks you over with new interest. “Can you now?”

You nod. Then, more carefully: “Yes, sir.”

He gestures with his chin. “Read it out.”

You do.

The words come smoothly. You feel each villager’s gaze settle on you, heavy as coins.

When you finish, the reeve’s mouth twists. “Not bad. Letters make men think they’re above their place. You got a place, boy?”

“I can help,” you say. “I can keep tallies. Copy records.” You don’t add: I can calculate interest, extrapolate yield, infer supply chains. You don’t say: I know how this kind of story usually ends, and I’d rather be behind a desk than on a pike.

He glances toward the direction the captain went. A tension there, subtle.

“Come to the hall,” he says finally. “If you’re useful, I’ll see about a writ to keep you out of the levy. Useful men belong to the ink, not the mud.”

You thank him. He’s already turned.

You exhale.

Day one, you think.

You have:

- A bed, at least for now.
- Food.
- A potential patron.
- A narrow, precarious path between being valuable and being threatening.

You also have questions:

Why does it matter if you survive the week?

Why this place? This era?

Why do you understand the rules and language as if someone is feeding them to you just in time?

You head toward the hall.

As you walk, snippets of not-quite-memory brush your mind: your hands already stained with ink, the weight of a quill; nights in this town, listening to rumors; the feel of different versions of this same street under rain, under summer dust, under snow. Like you’ve been thrown not into a completely foreign life, but into an earlier save file of someone else’s.

A boy runs past, almost colliding with you. “Sorry, master,” he gasps, skidding away.

Master.

It lands, an unsteady dignity. Maybe that’s who “you” are here. A half-trained clerk. A half-trusted outsider.

If you play that role well enough for seven days, maybe you get home.

Or maybe “home” is just the next place you wake.

The hall is a dim stone building that smells of wax and wool and cold iron. Inside, a long table scarred by knives and rings and spilled ink. Seated at its head: the reeve, with a ledger before him.

The captain stands to one side, arms folded, regarding you like a puzzle.

On the table is a quill. A real feather, trimmed to a fine point. A small clay pot of ink black as midnight.

“Write your name,” the reeve says.

You take the quill.

It fits your fingers.

You lean over the page.

For a heartbeat the letters swim, wrong shapes, wrong curves—and then your hand moves, confident, drawing out your name in script that’s not yours but is.

The ink soaks into the paper.

The reeve nods. The captain’s expression closes: you’ve slipped out of his reach for now.

“A clerk, then,” the reeve says. “You’ll start by copying this.”

He turns the ledger toward you.

The page is dense with names, owed grain, fines, conscripts. Lives flattened into lines.

You start copying.

The scratching of the quill becomes a thin, persistent sound. Outside, you hear the distant march of boots on dirt, the shouted orders of officers, the creak of carts.

As you work, you realize something alarming.

Every name you copy, every tally you make, you know what becomes of it. The knowledge sits just beneath conscious thought, like memories from yet another version of this week.

That man: will die on day three, arrow in the gut. That boy: will never return. That farmer: will burn his own field before the soldiers can take it.

The ink doesn’t just record. It binds.

You falter.

“What is it?” the reeve asks.

You meet his gaze.

If you survive the week by making the right choices with that ledger, maybe you wake up.

If you don’t, maybe you stay here, in the slow disaster you helped script.

You steady your hand.

“Nothing,” you say. “Just making sure I get it right.”

You bend over the page and, one by one, you begin to decide whose fate to change.

Outside, the world moves toward war.

Inside, you have a quill, seven days, and the faint, terrifying suspicion that whatever you correct here might follow you back into the waking world.

You dip the quill again.

This is how your week begins.
