You feel a storm approaching and the air grows thick and electric, pressing against your skin like a held breath. The gentle rustle of leaves turns sharp, then frenzied, as the wind whips through the canopy. Sunlight, once dappled and warm, vanishes behind a bruised tapestry of clouds rolling in from nowhere.

A single raindrop strikes your cheek—cold as a tear. Then another. And then the sky ruptures.

Rain doesn’t fall—it *hurls* itself from above, heavy and silver, drumming the leaves into a roaring chorus. Thunder doesn't rumble; it *cracks*, splitting the sky open like a whip. With it comes a flash—not of lightning, but of something *else*. For an instant, the forest is lit in impossible hues: violet, gold, and a green so deep it feels like seeing inside your own bones.

And then, between one heartbeat and the next, the rain *changes*. It no longer wets your skin—it *sings*. Each drop carries a note, a fragment of forgotten lullaby. The wind carries voices—some familiar, some not of this world—whispering secrets in languages that twist in your mind like smoke.

Ahead, a path appears, one you’ve never seen before, lined with stones that glow faintly beneath the downpour. At the end of it, barely visible through the veil of singing rain, stands a figure. Tall, cloaked in shifting shadows, holding a lantern made of frozen moonlight.

The voice reaches you, not through the air, but within your chest:  
**"You weren’t supposed to wake up. Why did you start remembering?"**
