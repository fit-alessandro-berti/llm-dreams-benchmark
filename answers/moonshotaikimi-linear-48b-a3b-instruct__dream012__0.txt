…must become the storm’s language.

The wheel trembles like a living thing beneath your palms, salt stinging every cut and scar you never bandaged after the last battle. You feel the sea’s ribs beneath the hull, groaning as if the world itself is compressing. Lightning forks sideways, bleaching the deck of every color except white and blue. Your crew—wet, bleary, one barefoot seaman clutching the rail as if it were a crucifix—wait for a word that will not fail.

You do not shout orders. You open your mouth and *sing*.

Not a song of empire or empire’s glory. A reef song, older than any captain, a chant of undertows and tides that remember when mountains were islands. The notes are salt themselves, drawn from the sea’s own throat. Your voice, cracked at first, knotted with barnacle scars, swells until it rides the wind like a mast. Where it touches the crew’s faces, their terror slackens; eyes widen not in fear but memory-they remember being plankton, being the first spiral of life uncoiling in a warm Precambrian sea.

The mainmast shudders. You see the crack beginning at the crow’s nest, a living lightning bolt racing downward. But you keep singing. The deck planks, soaked and warped, begin to soften; they lift, curling upward like the mouths of sleepers. Barnacles fling themselves free, swirling into tiny cyclones that stitch the timber back together. The crack stalls, crystallizes into a ribbon of glassy obsidian.

Now the storm answers. The wind, which had been a thief stealing the horizon, drops its hands. The waves hesitate, as if mid-bow. And in that hush you feel the ship settle—not into the sea, but into the sea’s *deep* understanding. You are no longer a captain but a single channel, a conduit. The ship is your ribs; the crew, your blood.

A final thunderclap rolls overhead, but instead of splitting the sky, it opens it—revealing not clouds but the black mirror of space beyond, distant stars flickering like bioluminescent plankton. You realize, without surprise, that this sea is not water but the oldest ocean mapping itself through every world that ever learned to float.

You wake—not to a deck but to a memory of plankton light. Your pulse is a tide. Somewhere, far below the waking ground, a hull creaks in perfect sync with your heartbeat, and you understand: the storm was never the enemy. It was the moment you decided to rewrite the definition of safe passage—from the absence of danger to the mastery of change.
