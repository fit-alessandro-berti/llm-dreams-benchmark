overhear snippets of their conversations—someone discussing a recent trip to a faraway land, another debating the merits of an obscure indie film, and yet another passionately explaining a complex scientific concept that goes entirely over your head. You smile politely, nodding as you pass, feeling both out of place and strangely intrigued.

You glance around the room, taking in the eclectic decorations: shimmering fairy lights draped along the walls, abstract art pieces that seem to watch you, and clusters of mismatched chairs that somehow make the space feel cozy. Music drifts faintly in the background—something instrumental and familiar, yet impossible to place.

You keep moving through the crowd, weaving between small circles of laughter and animated gestures. You spot a tray of colorful hors d'oeuvres and consider grabbing one, but a server passes just out of reach.

Finally, after what feels like hours, you catch a glimpse of the person you know—a flash of their distinct hairstyle or the sound of their unmistakable laugh. You push through the final layer of the crowd, only to find they’re already surrounded by a group of people. They look up, see you, and wave.

“There you are!” they say, breaking away to meet you. “I was wondering when you’d find me. Come on, I have someone I want you to meet.” They take your arm and lead you deeper into the party, the hum of conversation rising and falling like waves around you.
