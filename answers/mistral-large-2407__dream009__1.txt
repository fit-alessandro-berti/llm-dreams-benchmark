...find a way to blend in and understand the customs of this era to survive and make sense of where you are. You step out of the modest dwelling you woke up in, the scent of earth and smoke filling your nostrils. The landscape is rural, with rolling hills and a nearby forest. People are dressed in simple, rustic clothing, and you notice horses and carriages are the primary mode of transportation.

As you walk towards the village center, you pass by a blacksmith hammering away at his forge, a woman churning butter, and children playing with wooden toys. You realize you're likely in a medieval or pre-industrial era. You decide to find clothing that will help you blend in, and perhaps a local who might be willing to help you navigate this unfamiliar world.

You approach a kind-looking elder sitting by a well, greeting them with a friendly smile. "Good day," you say, hoping the language is understood. The elder smiles back, responding in a language that's vaguely familiar. You pick up words here and there, and through gestures and context, you gather they're inviting you to their home.

Following them, you enter a humble cottage. The elder offers you a simple meal of bread and stew, which you graciously accept. As you eat, you point to objects, asking their names, and begin to learn the language. You notice a worn, leather-bound book on a shelf. The elder sees your interest and hands it to you. It's a historical record of the area, filled with illustrations and text. You realize this might be your key to understanding where—and when—you are.

As you flip through the pages, you notice a map. You decide that you'll explore the marked locations, hoping to find more clues about this era and, perhaps, a way back home. The elder, noticing your interest in the map, offers to help you navigate the area. With a new ally and a growing understanding of the language and customs, you set out to unravel the mysteries of this different era, your dream continuing down an exciting path of discovery and adventure.
