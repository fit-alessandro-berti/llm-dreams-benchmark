**Completion of the Dream:**  

As you step onto the stage, the spotlight brightens, and the audience’s faces blur into fleeting glimpses of hope and curiosity. You take a deep breath, your voice steady but faltering—a vulnerability that suddenly feels braver than staying silent. You begin to speak, your first words hesitating before pouring out in a rush:  

*"Tonight, I want to talk about something no one here will ever understand: the sound my daughter makes when she’s nervous, the way she curls into shells like a hermit crab... and how when I was thirteen, I spent three hours crying into my shower, trying to wash away a fight I’d witnessed at school—the way the teacher had dismissed us as *juveniles*?"*  

The crowd’s murmurs build into a sympathetic hum. A tear escapes your corner—not disappointment, but the raw, beautiful release of letting yourself *be* flawed. The girl in the front row, whose eyes matched yours, nods slowly, as if agreeing. Others lean forward, their masks of uniformity cracking.  

You pause. The silence isn’t empty—it thrums with unspoken truth. You lean forward, your hand brushing the air behind you like a question in the wind. *"What kept you breathing?"*  

A man in the front row raises his daughter’s hand. *"To prove I’m still a kid, even when grown-up cares ignore me"*—  

The room holds its breath until the woman behind him speaks, her voice a rumble of gravel and grounder: *"Because one night..."*  

The storytelling begins anew, each voice a thread in a tapestry of resilience. The final words ripple upward, a question that hangs like a question between stars: *"Did she ever finish her shower, or did she just keep swimming?"*  

Your throat tighens. For a heartbeat, the world feels lighter. Then you smile, small and radiant, and let the echo fade.  

The lights dim.  

The dream fades.
