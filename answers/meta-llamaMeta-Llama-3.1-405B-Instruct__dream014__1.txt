...accept their offer, and they lead me through the winding streets, pointing out landmarks and sharing stories about the city's history. As we walk, the group grows larger, with more and more people joining in to help me find my way. We become a joyful procession, laughing and chatting, and I feel a sense of belonging and connection that I hadn't felt in a long time.

As we turn a corner, I see a beautiful park in the distance, filled with towering trees and vibrant flowers. The group leads me to a tranquil pond in the center of the park, where a small wooden boat is waiting. One of the strangers hands me a pair of oars, and I climb aboard, feeling a sense of peace and clarity wash over me.

As I begin to row, the boat glides smoothly across the water, leaving a trail of ripples behind. The group watches from the shore, smiling and waving, and I feel their kindness and support carrying me forward. The city's sounds fade into the distance, replaced by the soothing lapping of the water against the boat's hull.

Suddenly, a warm light begins to emanate from the surrounding trees, illuminating the pond and the city beyond. The strangers start to sing, their voices blending in harmony, and I join in, feeling my heart fill with joy and gratitude. The song grows louder and more vibrant, and the light becomes a radiant glow, enveloping everything in a sense of love and connection. I feel myself becoming one with the city, the strangers, and the universe itself, and in that moment, I know I am home.
