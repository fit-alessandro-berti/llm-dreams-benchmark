You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to panic, your heart racing as you weave through bustling streets lined with towering, mismatched buildings—some sleek and modern, their glass facades glinting like mirrors, others crumbling and ancient, moss creeping up their stone walls. The air hums with a strange energy, a mix of distant honks and an unplaceable melody drifting from somewhere above.

Ahead, a neon-lit food cart floats by, defying gravity as it hawks glowing tacos that pulse with an eerie blue light. You blink, unsure if you’re hungry or hallucinating. A mime steps out from the crowd—except he’s not miming at all. He’s whistling a jaunty tune and, without a word, thrusts a map into your hands. It’s made of cotton candy, pink and fluffy, and before you can protest, it starts melting, leaving sticky smears across your fingers. You squint at the dissolving directions: “Take a left at the invisible dog park.” Great.

Time’s ticking. You glance up, searching for a landmark, and spot a clock tower looming over the skyline. Its hands are spinning backward, each tick a mocking reminder that your meeting is slipping further into chaos. The city’s surreal sprawl seems to shift around you—alleys twist, buildings lean closer, and a parade of clowns on unicycles suddenly blocks your path, honking rubber horns in unison. You’re not sure whether to laugh or scream.

Desperate, you follow the mime’s sticky clue, turning left where a faint chorus of ghostly barks echoes through the air. There’s no park, just a shimmering mirage of wagging tails. The mime reappears, now juggling flaming batons, and grins. “You’re late,” he says, his voice like gravel, “but the meeting’s been waiting for you forever.” Before you can ask what that means, the ground tilts, and you’re sliding toward a glowing door that wasn’t there a second ago. Good luck.
