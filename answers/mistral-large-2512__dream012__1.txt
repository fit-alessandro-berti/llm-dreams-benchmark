**The Storm’s Heart**

The wind howls like a wounded beast, tearing at the sails as if the very sky seeks to devour your ship. The *Iron Mermaid* groans beneath you, her timbers straining against the fury of the sea. Waves rise like black mountains, their crests crowned with foam, and for a heartbeat, you are suspended in the air—weightless—before the deck slams back beneath your boots.

Your crew moves like shadows in the storm, their faces pale under the flickering lantern light. The helmsman, old Harkin, grips the wheel with white-knuckled hands, his beard stiff with salt. "Captain!" he shouts over the gale. "The rudder’s near sheared off! We can’t hold her much longer!"

You don’t answer at first. Your eyes are fixed on the horizon—or what *should* be the horizon. Instead, there is only the storm’s maw, a churning void where the sea and sky have become one. And then you see it: a light. Not the sickly yellow of a lantern, but something *older*. A pulse of blue-green fire, deep beneath the waves, rising, rising—

A crack like thunder splits the air. The mainmast snaps like a twig, the sail collapsing into the sea. Your first mate, Veyra, grabs your arm, her dark eyes wide. "Captain, we have to abandon ship!"

But you know better. This storm isn’t natural. The sea is *hungry*.

You turn to your crew, your voice cutting through the chaos. **"All hands! Secure the cargo—*now*!"** They hesitate—abandoning ship is the safer choice—but something in your tone makes them obey. They scramble to the hold, dragging out the iron-bound chest you’ve guarded since leaving port. The one you were told never to open.

The waves surge higher, and the *Iron Mermaid* tilts violently. The chest slips from their grasp, sliding toward the railing. You lunge, catching it just as the ship lurches again. The lid creaks open.

Inside, there is no gold. No jewels. Only a single, rusted key.

The blue-green light below the waves *flares*. The sea parts—not like water, but like *flesh*, revealing a cavernous mouth lined with jagged teeth of coral and bone. A voice, neither human nor beast, slithers into your mind: *"You have what is mine, little captain."*

You don’t think. You act.

Gripping the key, you raise it high—and *plunge* it into the deck.

The ship *screams*.

Wood splinters. Iron groans. The *Iron Mermaid* doesn’t sink—she *unfolds*, her hull peeling back like the petals of some monstrous flower. The key burns in your hand, and suddenly, you *understand*. This was never a ship. It was a *cage*.

And the thing in the sea? It was the prisoner.

The storm stills. The waves flatten. The blue-green light surges upward, coalescing into a shape—a figure of living water and storm, its eyes like twin stars. It regards you, and you feel the weight of centuries in its gaze.

*"You have freed me,"* it says. *"Now I will spare your world."*

Then it is gone, dissolving into the wind, leaving only the whisper of a promise: *"But I will return."*

The *Iron Mermaid* reforms around you, whole once more. The crew stands in stunned silence, the chest now empty. The sea is calm. The sky is clear.

And you?

You are still the captain.

But the ship is no longer yours.

And neither, perhaps, is the sea.
