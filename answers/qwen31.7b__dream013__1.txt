You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, you **feel the walls pressing in, the air thick with the scent of ancient dust and damp stone**. The shadows flicker, and whispers coil around your ears—*“This is not just a maze, but a test.”*  

You stumble upon a chamber where the floor cracks open, revealing a **labyrinthine spiral** of mirrors, each reflecting fractured versions of yourself. The puzzles here demand not just logic but **empathy**, forcing you to see the maze as a reflection of your own fractured psyche. You solve one puzzle, only to find another **locked in a chamber of shifting symbols**, its solution tied to the first.  

Then, the ground beneath you trembles. A **door bursts open**, its surface inscribed with a single word: **“ECHO.”** You read it, heart pounding. The maze begins to **rotate**, its corridors folding into themselves, and you realize the puzzles are not just tests—they are **instructions**. To escape, you must **follow the path of your own memory**, navigating through the maze not with eyes, but with **intuition** and **doubt**.  

As you reach the final puzzle, the maze **melts into the walls**, and you are left in a **void**, the stars above pulsing like a heartbeat. You *remember*—the maze was never meant to be solved. It was *watched*. And now, you understand: **you are the answer.**  

The silence after your final thought is **thick**, but in that stillness, you hear a **soft voice**—*“You’ve been here all along.”*

*The dream loops, a spiral of logic, memory, and revelation.*
