You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak. But the words that tumble out aren't the polished lines you've rehearsed a thousand times in the mirror—no, they're a cascade of forgotten languages, bubbling up like champagne from a shaken bottle. The audience leans in, mesmerized, as you declare in ancient Sumerian that the universe is merely a cosmic game of hide-and-seek, where black holes are the best hiding spots and stars are the giddy seekers who give themselves away with their twinkling laughter.

The microphone hums in agreement, transforming into a flock of iridescent butterflies that flutter around your head, dusting your shoulders with pollen that smells like fresh rain and forgotten childhood promises. Below, the crowd shifts; their faces morph into a sea of familiar strangers—your third-grade teacher with Einstein's wild hair, a childhood dog barking applause in Morse code, and Elon Musk juggling quantum entanglement orbs like they're beach balls. They rise as one, not to cheer, but to join you, their voices weaving into a polyphonic symphony that echoes off the rafters, turning the auditorium into a vast, breathing cathedral of light.

You gesture wildly, and the stage cracks open like an egg, spilling rivers of liquid starlight that lap at the edges of reality. "We're all just echoes," you proclaim, now fluent in the tongue of whales and wind, "dreaming each other into being!" The lights dim, then explode into fireworks of pure thought—ideas unfurling like origami cranes, each one carrying a secret wish. The audience dissolves into confetti, swirling around you in a joyous tornado, and for a heartbeat, you float weightless, the speech forgotten, the dreamer and the dream indistinguishable.

Then, softly, the alarm clock chimes—a distant bell tolling the end of the intermission. You wake with stardust on your lips, the echo of applause still thrumming in your chest, wondering if the real speech is the one you'll give tomorrow... or if this was it all along.
