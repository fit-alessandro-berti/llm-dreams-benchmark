You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find a way to communicate with the people here**. The air is thick with the scent of earth and wood, and the sounds of nature fill the silence—birds chirping, rustling leaves, the distant call of a river. You’re not sure how long you’ve been dreaming, but the feeling of being alive is strong.

You step cautiously through the forest, your heart racing. You notice that the trees are tall and ancient, their bark worn smooth by time. Strange flowers bloom in the underbrush, and the ground is soft beneath your feet. You look around, trying to make sense of your surroundings.

You remember something from your dream—the idea of a **language** that might be spoken in this place. You try to think of words, gestures, or even sounds that might be understood. But the silence is deafening, and the only thing you can do is **move forward**.

You follow a path that leads deeper into the woods, where the light begins to shift and the air grows cooler. You feel a strange pull, as if the forest is watching you. You stop, and for a moment, you hear a voice—not quite human, but something close. It’s soft, rhythmic, and it echoes in your mind.

You listen again, and the voice repeats itself:  
**"Come closer."**

You take a deep breath and step closer to the sound. The forest seems to respond, and the voice becomes clearer. It speaks in a language you don’t recognize, but you begin to understand. It’s not a word, but a **pattern**—a rhythm that matches the way you move, the way you breathe.

You realize now that you’re not just dreaming—you’re in a **language of movement**, a form of communication that transcends words. You begin to walk with more purpose, guided by the rhythm of the forest. You learn to **listen to the land**, to read the signs in the wind and the leaves, and to **embody the language** of the jungle.

The dream ends as suddenly as it began, leaving you with an unsettling sense of wonder. You wake up in your bed, still feeling the pull of the forest, the whisper of the wind, and the echo of a voice that never quite left you.

You know now that you’re not just dreaming—you’re part of something greater. And you’re ready to learn.
