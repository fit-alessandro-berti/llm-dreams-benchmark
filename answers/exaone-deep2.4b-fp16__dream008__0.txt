**Dream Continuation:**  

The office hums; your boss, Mr. Thistle-Hill, sits across the table awaiting your decision. His gaze lingers on you as you stare at the whiteboard listing the *impregnable deadline* of *30 October*. suddenly, the world sharpens: the clock strikes midnight, and the wall of markers flakes away. Instead of panic, a spark of insight strikes—you remember a failed project you once approached by iterating day-over-day, only to crash under the pressure.  

“Start now!” you beg the boss, fingers flying across notes you’ve jotted hours of brainstorming *past*. He mocks with a sigh, but as you sprint to the printer, the light flickers. The clock suddenly reads *6:07 AM*.  

You grab your keys, sprint to the kitchen, grab a coffee, and **then the timer begins**. You work triple-time, the deck of cards you’ve collected on the desk begin to turn into an inventory of potential shortcuts. The boss? He’s following, but his focus is on the spreadsheets, which, surprisingly, look... manageable. By noon, the half-day’s work folds into a solution—**the impossible deadline? Had a miscalculation turned that into a window to streamline everything**. The boss catches you mid-sweep, hand to your shoulder.  

“You’re good, aren’t you?” he says, but you blast a catchy tune from your phone. He cracks a smile. “Well at least I’ll stop you from wasting the project.”  

As you finish, the conference call disconnects. You turn to the board. The remaining tasks? done in under an hour—because there *is* a way to prioritize like this. The boss walks away, muttering about “last-minute surprises,” but you glance at the now-clean whiteboard. *The answer wasn’t a deadline*, you think—it was an *approach*.  

You exit, already heading to your next dream’s resolution.
