You are walking – not trudgewing, not striving – just walking through an exceedingly peaceful forest, ferns carpeting the mossy ground near ancient cedarbarns. Dust motes danced in a honeycolored light filtering through leaves so dense it almost held the sun captive. A single blue butterfly, impossibely bold, landed briefly on your outstretched finger and took flight with an iridescent shimmer.  Everything hummed with a sweet, gentle quiet.

You feel a storm approaching - a thickening of the air, a sudden, bitter cold that pricked at your cheeks, and an alarming shift in the music of the forest.  Birdsong halted abruptly; even the rustle of wind through needles ceased.  Then, the rain arrived not in the delicate, shimmering droplets I anticipated, but in solid silver curtains. 


They weren’t wet, precisely, but *hard*- solidified light that slammed against the leaves and fell against the ground like tiny, perfect knives. And as soon as it hit, faces – perfectly sculpted, exquisitely melancholy faces with closed eyes – began forming from the silver rain. Hundreds of them, rising before you like ghostly sculptures, arranged in impossible patterns, swirling and shifting.


Within each of them, I realized with a growing horror, was my own face, young, then middle-aged, then wrinkled, radiating an unspoken sadness that resonated not just in the faces themselves, but within me - a vast, unbearable loneliness stretching back for an unknowable era. 

Above, where the blue butterfly had once been, now hovered a single, gargantuan moth - wings of stained glass that refracted the silver rain, illuminating the faces that rose and fell with the shifting patterns of the storm. 



And a voice – not spoken aloud, but *understood* without needing sound – whispered in my consciousness, “You haven’t forgotten, have you?” 




Suddenly, a key shimmered into existence at your feet - a golden, intricately etched key, leading nowhere in particular, but radiating a warmth that battled fiercely against the accumulating cold.  




The mothy eye fixed it.




Do you pick up the key?
