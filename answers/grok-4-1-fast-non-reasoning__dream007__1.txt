You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **challenge them to a duel at dawn—not with swords, but with ukuleles on a floating iceberg**. 

The dream twists: the iceberg drifts into a neon-lit city where skyscrapers pulse like heartbeats. Your friend pulls out a ukulele shaped like a flamingo, strumming a melody that summons dancing penguins in tuxedos. You counter with a bassline that cracks the ice, revealing a hidden underwater disco. Words turn to riffs, anger melts into harmony, and suddenly you're both jamming with a choir of glowing jellyfish, the argument forgotten in a symphony of absurd reconciliation. The sun rises as pizza, and you wake up craving pineapple on your ukulele strings.
