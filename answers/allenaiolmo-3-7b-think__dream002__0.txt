As the storm’s first crackle of thunder tears through the air, the forest shudders. The towering oaks, once stoic sentinels, bend like bowstrings, their leaves swirling into a kaleidoscope of gold and crimson before spiraling downward in a sudden, violent dance. The ground trembles, cracks splitting the earth like lightning, and the air thickens with the ozone tang of impending rain. You feel a primal pull toward a grove of trees that pulse faintly, their bark glowing an eerie blue—a path illuminated by the ghostly light of distant lightning.  

The wind howls, not as a sound but as a *voice*, echoing through the branches: *"Follow the cracks."* Your boots sink into the mud as you step forward, the ground giving way to a narrow, serpentine river that cuts through the forest floor. Its waters ripple with liquid mirrors, reflecting not your face but fleeting visions—childhood summers, forgotten fears, a door you’ve never dared to open. As you wade deeper, the water rises to your chest, cold and electric, and the trees around you twist into skeletal arches, their shadows pooling like ink.  

A creature emerges from the mist—a fox, but not ordinary. Its fur shimmers with bioluminescent patterns, and its eyes hold galaxies. It speaks in riddles, its voice a chorus of wind and rain: *"The storm unearths what the earth hides."* Before you can question it, the river surges, carrying you through a tunnel of lightning that dissolves into a void of starlight.  

When the vision fades, you stand in a meadow where the sky is a perfect circle of twilight, and the trees here grow upside-down, their roots stretching skyward. A single, perfect rose blooms at your feet, its petals etched with symbols that shift and glow. As you touch it, the world fractures—a memory of your grandmother’s hands, a half-remembered song, a door that now hangs open in your chest.  

The storm passes, leaving the forest scarred but alive. When you wake, the dream clings to you: the rose’s scent lingers, and the symbols pulse faintly on your skin, a map to something you’ve never named. The forest feels… different now, as if it too has been transformed.  

*You step outside, and the rain falls just as it did in the dream—a gentle, knowing drizzle.*
