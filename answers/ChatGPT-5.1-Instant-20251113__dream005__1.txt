…each group seems to be acting out a different fragment of someone else’s memory.

One group is huddled around a coffee table covered in board games, but every time you look away and look back, the pieces rearrange themselves into new rules you’ve never heard of. They insist you’ve played with them before and urge you to take your turn, smiling expectantly, though none of them agree on what your turn is supposed to be.

A little farther on, you pass a trio dressed as if they’re attending three different eras’ worth of parties—one in a flapper dress, one in a futuristic metallic jacket, one in a faded college hoodie. They’re discussing an event you supposedly hosted. When they see you, they wave you over and immediately start asking how you managed “that impossible trick,” though they never explain what the trick was.

Past them, you find a hallway where the music suddenly becomes soft and underwater-like. People stand in small clusters whispering, but their voices sound muffled, as if spoken through glass. As you walk by, each group pauses and stares at you with recognition—warm, but confused—like they can’t remember why they know you, only that they do.

You keep moving, growing more certain you’re close to the one person you actually know. Ahead, there’s a door slightly ajar spilling warm golden light. You push through it and—

You find them. They’re standing alone on a balcony overlooking a twilight cityscape, just as dreamlike as the party behind you. They turn, smile, and say:

“There you are. I was hoping you’d find me before everything changes again.”

And in that moment, you realize the city, the party, and even the dream are about to shift—but you’re finally not facing it alone.
