(laughs) Ah, look at me now! With the storm raging around us, I can see how everything is going to be affected. I've been sailing these waters for years, keeping my helm steady on the horizon, but what's happened? Our ship, the "Maverick's Revenge", is about to go down. We'll have to prepare as soon as the storm blows in, because our crew needs us now.
