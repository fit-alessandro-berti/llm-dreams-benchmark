Here's a continuation of the dream scenario:

You start to walk down a wide, cobblestone street lined with towering buildings that seem to shift and change as you move. The architecture is a strange mix of styles - Art Deco facades blend into futuristic glass structures, while ancient stone arches curve between modern skyscrapers.

Your phone buzzes in your pocket, but when you pull it out, the screen displays nothing but swirling, incomprehensible symbols. A gentle breeze carries the distant sound of a clock chiming, which seems to be coming from everywhere and nowhere at once.

You approach a stranger to ask for directions, but as you get closer, you realize their face is blank - smooth and featureless like a mannequin. Suddenly, you notice a small, ornate envelope tucked into your jacket pocket. You open it and find a cryptic map with landmarks that don't seem to match the city around you.

The meeting time is drawing closer, and you feel a growing sense of urgency mixed with a strange, dreamlike calm. Which way will you go?

Would you like me to continue the dream narrative, or would you prefer to guide the next steps?
