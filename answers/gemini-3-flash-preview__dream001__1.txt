You start to ask the passersby for directions, but their mouths are filled with silver thread, and they only answer in harmonies that sound like cello strings. You look down at your hand to check a map, but instead of paper, you are holding a handful of dry autumn leaves. Each leaf has a street name written on it in ink that fades the moment you try to read it.

The city begins to stretch. The skyscrapers lean inward, their windows reflecting a sky the color of an old bruise. You duck into an alleyway, hoping for a shortcut, but the alleyway opens into a grand cathedral made entirely of train schedules. Millions of yellowing papers flutter in a draft that smells like ozone and burnt cinnamon. Every flutter represents a minute you’ve lost.

Panic rises in your chest—a heavy, rhythmic pulsing—but as you run, your feet lose their weight. The cobblestones turn into piano keys that chime under your stride, playing a frantic, dissonant melody. You find a glass elevator attached to the side of a tower that reaches past the clouds. You press the button for the top floor, but the elevator voice whispers, *"We only stop at the Echoes today."*

When the doors slide open, you aren't in a boardroom. You are standing on a giant, floating balcony overlooking an ocean of dark ink. In the center of the balcony is a mahogany table where three versions of yourself are already seated, checking their watches. Their watches have no hands, only spinning compass needles.

"You're late," they say in unison, their voices echoing like distant thunder. "We've already decided who you are going to be tomorrow."

You try to speak, to explain the missing address or the shifting streets, but your voice comes out as a shower of gold coins that clatter against the floor and roll over the edge, falling silently into the ink below. 

Just as the tallest version of you stands up to hand you a heavy, iron key, the sky cracks. A bright, clinical white light bleeds through the ceiling, and the city begins to dissolve into the smell of fresh coffee and the persistent, rhythmic chirp of an alarm clock ringing in a world you had forgotten.
