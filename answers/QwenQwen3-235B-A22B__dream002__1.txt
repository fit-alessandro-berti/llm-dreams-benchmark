You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and **the air grows thick with static, the scent of petrichor rising before the first raindrop even falls. The canopy above, once a mosaic of gold and green, darkens to bruised purples as the wind thrashes the trees into frenzied dancers. A low rumble vibrates in your chest—not just thunder, but something deeper, like the forest itself is warning you.**  

**You run, but the ground shifts beneath your feet, roots twisting upward like skeletal fingers to trip you. Lightning cracks the sky, and in its flash, you see a figure standing motionless in the clearing ahead—a silhouette draped in tattered robes, their face obscured by a hood glowing faintly with bioluminescent moss. They hold out a hand, palm up, as if offering something small and shimmering: a key, perhaps, or a shard of mirror reflecting not your face, but a constellation you don’t recognize.**  

**The storm crescendos. Rain soaks you in seconds, yet the figure remains dry, their voice a chorus of whispers when they finally speak: *“Choose,”* they say, *“the storm or the silence after.”* Behind them, the trees begin to dissolve into mist, revealing a path you hadn’t noticed—a staircase carved into the earth, spiraling downward into warmth and light, or upward into a void where stars blink like eyes waiting to open.**  

**You reach out… and the dream fractures.**
