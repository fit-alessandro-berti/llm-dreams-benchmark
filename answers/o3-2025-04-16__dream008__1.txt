…feel the familiar knot in your stomach tighten. The office lights hum too loudly, colors smear at the edges of your vision, and the clock above your boss’s head sprouts extra hands that whip around in frantic circles.  

You sit at your desk and open the project folder: inside, the pages are blank save for a single line that keeps rewriting itself faster than you can read. Letters spill off the paper, crawl across your keyboard, and vanish between the keys. Your boss clears his throat—a sound like shattering glass—and asks, “Well? Can you finish before the clock decides to stop?”  

You try to type, but your fingers sink into the keys as though they’re made of warm clay. Words refuse to appear. A sudden breeze lifts every document in the office into a slow-motion cyclone—sheets orbit like tiny moons, casting paper‑thin shadows that slide across your face.  

Panicked, you lunge for the nearest sheet. Instead of paper, you find a miniature version of yourself clinging to the corner, shouting inaudible instructions. You squint; it mouths, “Breathe.”  

So you breathe. The desk dissolves into a calm shoreline, monitors turning into smooth gray stones. Colleagues drift past as translucent silhouettes, each carrying glowing hourglasses that pour upward instead of down. Time, apparently, can be persuaded.  

You close your eyes and imagine the finished project—diagrams crisp, paragraphs sharp, deadlines met. When you open them, the pages reappear on your lap, perfectly formatted. Your boss, now wearing a wristwatch the size of the moon, checks it and smiles, oddly serene.  

“See?” he says, voice now gentle. “You only had to remember you’re dreaming.”  

The lights fade to the soft colors of dawn. The office windows swing open to reveal a sky full of giant, floating sticky notes that read DONE in bright ink. Relief spreads through you like warm sunlight.  

A phone rings somewhere far away—your real‑world alarm—and everything blurs. The last thing you feel is the weight of the impossible deadline lifting off your shoulders as you drift awake, already half‑smiling at how effortlessly you met it… in the dream.
