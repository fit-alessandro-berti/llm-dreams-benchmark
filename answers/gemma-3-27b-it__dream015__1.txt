You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **build a library.**

It sounds insane, even to *me*, in the dream. Everyone else is scavenging for food, fortifying shelters, fighting over fuel. They look at me with a mixture of pity and suspicion as I painstakingly clear rubble from the skeletal remains of what was once the town hall. Dust motes dance in the weak sunlight filtering through the broken windows, illuminating the chipped marble floors.

My name is… well, I don’t *remember* my name, not exactly. It feels like a faded photograph in my mind. But I know I need to do this. A desperate, illogical need.

I start small. Salvaging books from ruined homes, carefully drying waterlogged pages in the sun. A tattered copy of "Pride and Prejudice," a half-burnt engineering textbook, a children’s book about constellations. Each one feels like a victory. 

Slowly, others start to… contribute. Old Man Tiber, a gruff mechanic who hoards tools, brings me a box of sheet music he found in a piano showroom. Maya, a young woman fiercely protective of her younger brother, offers a collection of botanical guides, remembering her grandmother’s garden. Even Kael, the leader of the local scavenging group, known for his ruthlessness, leaves a stack of maps at the doorway one night. He doesn’t say a word, just disappears into the shadows.

The library isn’t grand. It’s a patchwork of salvaged furniture, makeshift shelves built from scrap wood, and a roof patched with tarps. But it’s *something*. A haven. 

People start coming. Not just to read, though they do. They come to *remember*. To share stories. To learn skills. Tiber uses the engineering textbook to repair the town’s broken water pump. Maya teaches children about edible plants using the botanical guides. I read aloud from "Pride and Prejudice," and for a moment, the harsh reality fades, replaced by the elegance of another time.

One evening, Kael sits in the corner, sharpening his knife. He doesn’t look at me, but I hear him murmur, “Used to read about strategy, before… all this.”

The library doesn’t solve the problems of this broken world. It doesn’t bring back what’s lost. But it offers something else. Hope. A connection to the past. A belief in a future worth building, not just surviving in. 

And as I look around at the faces illuminated by the flickering lamplight, faces etched with hardship but also with a flicker of something… brighter, I realize that maybe, just maybe, rebuilding civilization isn’t about rebuilding structures, but rebuilding *stories*. 

Then, a single page from a book, brittle and yellowed, floats down and lands on my hand. It’s a poem, and as I begin to read the words, the edges of the dream start to blur… and I feel myself waking up.
