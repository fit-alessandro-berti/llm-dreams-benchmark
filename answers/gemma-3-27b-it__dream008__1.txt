You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss, Mr. Henderson, is waiting for you to start, and… and he’s *wearing a full suit of armor*. Not a historical recreation, but a gleaming, slightly dented, medieval suit of armor. He’s tapping a gauntleted finger on the stack of files representing the project – “Operation: Stellar Alignment” – and the metal rings with each tap.

“Right, right,” he booms, his voice echoing strangely within the helmet. “Stellar Alignment. Needs to be completed by… oh, let’s say, sunrise. Yes, sunrise. Absolutely crucial for… interdimensional logistics. Don’t ask. Just *do*.”

My mouth opens and closes, but no sound comes out. Sunrise? It’s currently 3:17 PM. And interdimensional logistics? I’m a marketing assistant! 

I glance down at the files. They aren’t filled with marketing briefs or competitor analysis. They’re filled with… constellations. Hand-drawn, incredibly detailed constellations, connected by lines of what looks like glitter glue. And equations. Equations involving the phases of the moon and the price of tea in China.

Mr. Henderson clears his throat, a sound like a blacksmith hammering. “Well? Don’t just stand there gaping. I expect a preliminary report in… oh, fifteen minutes. And make it *sparkle*. Interdimensional beings appreciate a good sparkle.”

Panic begins to bubble up, but it’s quickly overtaken by a strange, detached amusement. This is a dream, right? A truly bizarre dream. 

Instead of protesting, instead of even *thinking* about protesting, I find myself nodding. “Right away, sir. Sparkle. Got it.”

I pull up a chair, and as I do, the chair transforms into a giant, fluffy sheep. I blink. The sheep doesn’t seem bothered. I cautiously sit on it. It’s surprisingly comfortable.

Then, a small, purple dragon lands on my keyboard. It looks at me expectantly. 

“Okay,” I say to the dragon, my voice sounding surprisingly calm. “You’re going to help me with the glitter glue, and the sheep is going to provide moral support. We have a deadline to meet. And apparently, interdimensional logistics to handle.”

I grab a tube of glitter glue, and the dragon, with a tiny puff of smoke, begins meticulously outlining the constellation of Orion. The sheep bleats encouragingly. 

This is going to be a long night. And a very sparkly one.
