**The Storm’s Whisper**

The sky above you splits open like a wound—black clouds churn with jagged fingers of lightning, and the air hums with an unnatural tension. The trees, once still and golden, now lean in unison, their branches twisting as if breathing. A wind howls through the underbrush, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and something older, something *alive*—like rain that has been waiting too long.

Then the first drop hits.

Not just rain. It’s *water*, but not like any you’ve known—it’s thick, viscous, and *alive*, pooling in the hollows of the forest floor. The ground beneath your feet shifts, the soil splitting open like a mouth. Roots lash out, coiling around your ankles, and you stumble, your boots sinking into the mud.

A voice—soft, but not human—whispers from the trees:

*"You were meant to stay."*

The storm isn’t just weather. It’s a *wake-up call*.

From the darkness ahead, something moves. Not a beast, not a monster—just… *awareness*. A shape, half-buried in the damp earth, watching you with eyes that glow faintly, like embers. It doesn’t run. It doesn’t attack. It *waits*.

And then, the forest *laughs*.

The rain turns to something else—something that drips from the leaves, something that *slithers* down your skin, cool and slick, and you realize too late that the storm isn’t coming to you. It’s *you* coming to it.

**What do you do?**
- **Run deeper into the forest**, hoping to find shelter—or something that might help.
- **Call out to the thing in the dark**, testing its nature.
- **Stay still**, trying to understand the warning before it’s too late.
- *(Or something else entirely—what’s your dream’s next move?)*
