strange and unlike anything you've studied before. Instead of formulas or textbook facts, the questions are riddles and scenarios that seem to blend memories from your dreams with fragments of real-life experiences. One question asks you to describe a door you've never seen but somehow feel you've walked through a hundred times. Another asks you to write a letter to your future self, but you're only allowed to use words that begin with the same letter as your name.

As you wrestle with the questions, the room around you starts to shift—walls melting into mist, desks floating gently upward. A gentle voice, neither teacher nor friend, whispers, "What do you truly wish to become?" You look down at your paper, and your handwriting begins to glow faintly, each word you write shaping the room a little more.

Suddenly, you realize: this isn't a test of what you've learned, but of who you are becoming. And as you answer the final question, you feel a sense of calm certainty—no matter the outcome, you already hold the key to your own future in your hands.
