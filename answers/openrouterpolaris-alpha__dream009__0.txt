…survive, blend in, and find a way to understand where—and when—you are.

The light is wrong first. It’s too soft, too golden, not fractured through smog or tinted by glass. You sit up on a straw mattress that crackles under your weight, wrapped in rough linen that smells faintly of smoke and thyme. Your fingers find no seams of polyester, no glow of a screen, no familiar rectangle of a phone.

A wooden shutter above you leaks a bar of morning. When you push it open, the world tilts.

A village clings to a winding dirt road. Houses are half-timbered and wattle-and-daub, roofs sagging under hand-cut shingles. Chickens patrol the mud. Two oxen haul a cart with iron-rimmed wheels that scream softly against the stones. Men and women move in wool, linen, leather—muted colors, hand-stitched seams. No wires, no cars, no satellite dishes. Smoke rises from low chimneys, blue and patient.

Your first impulse is ridiculous: check for Wi-Fi. Your hand slips to where your pocket should be and finds only the coarse fabric of a borrowed tunic. Bare feet on cold floorboards. Your heart thumps a warning: you’ve lost your tools, your maps, your language of convenience. Civilization feels thinner here, louder in its simplicity.

You need to:

1. Understand the rules.
2. Blend in before you’re noticed.
3. Discover if this is past, elsewhere, or something stranger.

You step outside.

The air bites with woodsmoke, manure, and baking bread. A woman in a faded blue dress eyes you—from your strange posture, your bare feet, the confusion ratting in your gaze. She carries a basket of dark loaves and moves closer, frowning. Her words reach you in a tumbling rush.

You understand none of it.

Panic flares. But some part of your mind, still cool and observational, notes the sounds: consonants pushed to the front of the mouth, rounded vowels, rhythm like a language you nearly know but not quite. Old? Regional? An ancestor of something you’re fluent in?

You offer an uncertain smile and point to your throat, then your head, miming disorientation. She studies you a moment longer, then presses a small heel of bread into your palm. A gesture as old as hunger.

You nod thanks—too modern a nod, too sharp—and correct yourself with a slow duck of the head. Her expression softens. She points down the road to a squat stone building with a wooden sign: a circle with lines carved through it. Maybe an inn. Maybe the heart of this place.

You walk.

Each step is negotiation: how would someone here move, speak, stand? You force your shoulders to relax, your scanning eyes to slow. You tuck away your instinct to catalog things as GPS points, as photographs. You have memory; you’ll have to trust it.

At the inn, men sit on benches by rough tables, clay cups in hand. Firelight paints everyone in amber and shadow. Their clothing confirms it: no zippers, only ties and toggles, simple metal buckles. A man carves something with a bone-handled knife, the shavings curling like pale petals. No stray scrap of plastic anywhere. The silence between voices hums with crackling logs, not refrigeration units.

You realize you need to answer three questions, fast:

- How far back is this?
- What stories do they tell about strangers?
- And what happens to people who don’t fit?

An older man behind the bar—broad, grey in the beard, eyes too sharp to miss much—watches you approach. He says something measured, expectant.

You catch one word that snagged your ears outside, repeated now: “pellegrin” or something near enough. Pilgrim. The word is scaffolding. You can work with that.

You touch your chest, nod, repeat softly, trying his accent: “Pellegrin.”

A pause. Then he snorts, half skeptical, half amused, but he gestures to an empty stool. You sit. A cup appears, sloshing with something sour and alive. You take a careful sip. Cider. Safe enough.

He points at you, then makes a circling gesture, then taps the table: where from?

You picture the map you used to carry inside your phone. You pick a distant town’s name that might plausibly exist here—or might not. But your tongue trips on a safer word: “Lontano,” you say, hoping distance can be its own country.

He huffs, but it passes. A few others glance up, assess the harmless strangeness of you, and return to their gossip.

You listen.

Names. Landmarks. Occasional exclamations that ring like pieces of Latin or an older Germanic root. You parse measures of time, references to last harvest, to a nearby market town, to “the Lord’s road,” to “the bishop’s man.” Church bells outside mark the hour with a heavy, resonant clang. So: a Christian calendar, at least. No visible gunpowder yet. No printing press in sight, though a scrap of parchment above the hearth bears clumsy inked letters, announcing something about a tithe.

Medieval, you think tensely. Or very much like it.

You need information, but questions are risky. Too sharp an interest in the wrong subject marks you as something other than hungry. You choose safe ground.

You tap your cup, then the man’s chest, and try: “Name?”

He straightens slightly. “Arnulf.” He points back at you. “E tu?”

You give a name that sits in both worlds; he repeats it, shaving off its modern edges until it sounds like it has always belonged here.

You help with small tasks—stacking wood, wiping tables—with deliberate clumsiness that can be forgiven as exhaustion. You watch how they tie ropes, how they cut bread, how they speak to those above and below them. You pay attention to who removes their cap when the small iron cross on the wall catches their eye. You mimic their reverence, just enough.

At dusk, a commotion outside. A rider arrives, cloak spattered with mud, bearing a rolled message sealed in wax. Everyone’s posture tightens. News from the lord, or the bishop, or war. You lean toward a window, mind clicking. Written language means scholars and records. Records might mean dates.

The rider enters, scanning faces. His gaze lands on you—an unknown face in a village small enough to know its own shadows. You steady yourself, shoulders down, eyes lowered, neither too bold nor too fearful.

He says something to Arnulf, jerking a thumb your way.

Arnulf replies—short, dismissive. You catch “pellegrin,” “strada,” and something like “nulla paura.” No fear. No trouble.

The rider grunts. His expression doesn’t soften.

You realize then: to survive this era, you can’t just hide. You need to anchor yourself—to a purpose they recognize, to knowledge you can safely reveal, without sounding like a witch or a mad prophet.

That night, in the loft where they let you sleep among sacks of grain, you stare at the rafters and lay out your options.

You need to:

- Offer a skill that fits: numbers, herbs, mending, simple engineering that doesn’t look like magic.
- Learn their language fast, to navigate danger.
- Discover the exact year, quietly.
- Figure out whether this is really your past…or a constructed dream with rules of its own.

A soft scratching at the tiny window. You ease it open. The village is silvered in moonlight. Far beyond the last house, over the dark line of the forest, a glow pulses faintly on the horizon—too even to be fire, too constant to be lightning.

No modern technology here, you think.

But something is humming out there. Not electric—not exactly. Something older or later or sideways.

You feel it, almost under your skin: a resonance that doesn’t belong in any history book you remember.

You realize you need to choose: stay here and burrow in, become part of this place and let the dream harden into a life—or follow that unnatural glow and test the edges of this reality.

You watch the distant light throb like a heartbeat.

Tomorrow, you decide, you’ll leave at first bell.

Because if this is truly another era, you must adapt to survive it.

And if it isn’t—if the world has jumped its own track—then out there, where the wrong light burns over the forest, you might find who pulled you into this dream…and why they need you to wake up somewhere else.
