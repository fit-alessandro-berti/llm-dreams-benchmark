**Dream Continuation:**

You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you—a shared dream you once vowed to pursue together, now fraying under the weight of clashing visions. You decide to **step outside to cool off**, but the world around you shifts as you cross the threshold. The street dissolves into a vast, sunlit meadow, and your friend stands at the far end, now silhouetted against a storm brewing over a fragile, rope-bridge spanning a chasm.  

“You have to choose,” they say, their voice echoing strangely, part-earnest, part-distant, like a memory. The bridge sways, half the ropes intact, the other half unraveling into smoke. You realize the bridge is *your friendship*—the gaps between the planks revealing old wounds, unspoken fears, the moments you’ve let gravity pull you apart.  

As you walk toward them, the argument’s words melt away, replaced by a visceral understanding: the storm isn’t about winning or losing, but about *carrying the weight together*. Halfway across, the ground trembles, and the chasm below morphs into a river of mirrors, each reflection showing alternate versions of your friendship—some joyful, some broken, all equally possible.  

Your friend extends a hand. In their palm lies a key, cold and heavy, though the lock it fits is unknown. “It’s not about being right,” they say softly. “It’s about… not letting this place drown.”  

You grasp the key. The storm pauses. In that suspended moment, you understand: the argument was never about the dream itself, but the fear of losing the person who once believed you could change the world *together*.  

The dream fades as you wake, the key’s weight lingering in your fist—and a strange, urgent hope in your chest.
