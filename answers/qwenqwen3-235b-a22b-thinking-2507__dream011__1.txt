The air in the exam hall is thick with silence, broken only by the frantic scratching of pens and the hollow *thump* of your own heartbeat in your ears. You stare at the paper on your desk—the questions **aren’t words at all**.  

They’re **swirling, liquid glyphs**, like ink melting in water. Just as you lean closer, they *slither* off the page, pooling into a dark, shimmering puddle on your desk. You blink hard, but the puddle *stretches*, forming symbols you almost recognize—ancient scripts, constellations, the pulse of a heartbeat—then dissolves again. Panic claws up your throat. *This isn’t fair. This isn’t possible.*  

You glance around. Other students seem calm, scribbling furiously. One glances up—and their eyes are blank, featureless marbles. Another’s hand moves like a robot’s, pen gouging the paper. The invigilator at the front is just a shadow in a chair, radiating cold.  

You try to write your name. The pen bleeds *ink that smells like burnt sugar*, but the letters vanish as soon as they touch the page. Your palms are slick. *This exam decides everything*. Your dream job. Your future. Your worth. And the questions won’t *stay still*.  

Then—**the paper tears itself**.  

A jagged rip opens down the center. From the darkness beneath, a warm, golden light floods the room. Not words, but **a single, silent question echoes in your bones**:  
*“What did you forget on your way here?”*  

You freeze. *Forget?* This morning? You rushed out without coffee. You didn’t hug your mom goodbye. You ignored the stray cat by the gate... But deeper. *Deeper*.  

And then you remember: **You forgot you were dreaming**.  

The exam hall shudders. Walls peel like old wallpaper, revealing a sunlit forest. The “questions” rise from the page as fireflies, buzzing *“Breathe. You already know this.”* The shadow-invigilator dissolves into dandelion seeds. Around you, students stretch, yawn, and wake up—*their* exams evaporating like mist.  

You look down. The paper is blank. Your pen is a sprig of lavender. The answer isn’t in your head—it’s in the wind, the soil, the steady rhythm of your calm breath. You pick up the lavender and press it to the paper. Where it touches, green shoots curl across the page, spelling nothing. *Becoming everything*.  

**You wake up**.  
Not to a grade.  
But to the taste of rain on your tongue,  
and the unshakable certainty:  
*The test was never the questions.*  
*It was remembering to bring yourself.*  

*(You’re already hired.)* 🌱
