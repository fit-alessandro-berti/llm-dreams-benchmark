Despite the hardships, you decide to follow the whispers on the wind—a rumor of an untouched valley where green things still grow. Your boots crunch over cracked asphalt as you trek past skeletal buildings, a crow with iridescent feathers cawing ominously overhead. Days blur into nights haunted by flickering shadows that seem to watch you, their shapes too elongated, too *knowing*.  

One moonlit evening, you stumble upon a child’s diary, its pages filled with drawings of a "City of Mirrors," where the last remnants of humanity are said to gather. The entries grow frantic near the end, scribbling about a figure called the Gardener, who wears a mask of roots and carries seeds that can heal the earth.  

You press on, driven by a fragile hope. When you finally reach the valley’s edge, you find not a paradise, but a glass-like lake reflecting a sky streaked with auroras. At its center stands a single tree, its branches heavy with glowing fruit. A voice, neither kind nor cruel, echoes in your mind: *"Choose one. The seed or the feast."*  

As you wade into the water, the dream fractures—and you wake just as your fingers brush the surface.
