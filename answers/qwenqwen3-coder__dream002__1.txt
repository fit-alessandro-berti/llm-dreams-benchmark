...the wind begins to howl through the canopy above. Leaves swirl around your feet as the sky darkens from blue to an ominous greenish-gray. The peaceful forest transforms into something wild and untamed.

You quicken your pace, searching for shelter, when you notice the trees around you starting to shift and bend in impossible ways - their branches reaching out like ancient arms, their bark shimmering with an otherworldly glow. The rain begins to fall, but instead of water, thousands of tiny, luminescent droplets descend, each one carrying a fragment of memory or dream.

As thunder rolls overhead, you realize this isn't just any storm. The forest floor beneath your feet becomes soft and yielding, pulsing gently like a heartbeat. Strange, phosphorescent flowers begin to bloom in the growing darkness, their petals whispering secrets in languages you've never heard but somehow understand.

The storm isn't ending - it's awakening something that has been sleeping in this place for centuries. And you, caught in the eye of this transformation, feel yourself becoming part of something much larger than you ever imagined...

What happens next in your dream?
