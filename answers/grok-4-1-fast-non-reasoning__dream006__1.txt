You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak, but your words come out as a bizarre symphony of animal noises—moos, quacks, and roars echoing through the microphone. The audience erupts in laughter, not mockery, but pure delight, as feathers sprout from your arms and you start flapping them like wings. Suddenly, the stage morphs into a giant trampoline, bouncing everyone higher and higher, presidents and rock stars tumbling alongside you in zero gravity. You grab a floating microphone shaped like a banana, declare yourself "Emperor of Nonsense," and lead the crowd in a conga line through cotton-candy clouds. Just as a flock of singing rubber ducks joins the parade, your alarm clock blares—you wake up giggling, speech notes scattered like confetti on your bed. Sweet dreams!
