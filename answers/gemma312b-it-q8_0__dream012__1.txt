…feel a surprising warmth in my hand. It’s a tiny, jade turtle, cold and slick, pulsing with an impossibly calm light beneath the thrashings outside the captain's porthole. Somehow, the crew hasn't noticed me gazing at it. No one notices *anything* unusual anymore. Fatigue hangs thick, palpable, in the air – faces are grayed with weeks at sea, their grip on the rigging strained with exhaustion and fear. Their eyes, usually gleaming with sailor’s grit, are just...distant echoes. 

The rain slashes down like shards of ice. The waves crash so violently I brace myself against the helm, feeling the vessel shudder with each impact as though it's struggling to breathe. “Report, Mr. Harding!” I yell over the roaring storm. There's moments worth of frantic static before his voice cracks over the coms. "Storm’s intensi-" and then the system cuts out. Excellent. Just excellent.

I grip the small turtle tighter until my knuckles ache. It's the only stable sensation in a maelstrom of chaos. I *know*, in a way I desperately hope is rational dreaming logic, that this seemingly fragile trinket is somehow key. 

I rise from my stool -  my boots seem to weigh lead - and look out at the tempest again. In a desperate gamble, ignoring every maritime lesson and instinct that drilled itself into me across decades, I turn *into* the waves. Not to brace myself *against* them – to meet them headlong. 

The ship lurches, cries echo from the forecastle, but then, something miraculous. With each surge, a tiny ripple of luminous green energy emanates from the jade turtle, washing over the immediate hull. The ferocious waves, just a heartbeat from consuming us, seem to hesitate, softening slightly as though repelled by an unseen shield. 

A young woman, Elara, – I don't recall assigning her to watch, but she stands rigid and pale near a broken mizzen rail – finally notices me clutching the turtle. Her tired face slowly transforms with wonder, replacing the listless weariness. More and more men turn toward me. They see something changing, not in the storm itself – it's *fierce* all the same- but in *their* feeling toward the storm.  Fear begins to ebb, replaced by a strange acceptance.  

There’s a shared understanding, quiet and profound passing amongst the men. A recognition that they are something, somehow, part of something larger. No one yells or panics anymore.  Just a focused determination that seems to pull together and steady the ship.



Suddenly, breaking through the deluge and screaming fury of wind is a mournful siren call--an otherworldly song vibrating through my very bone. Looking up now amidst the spray reveals… stars.  Not just any stars, but an iridescent galaxy, a nebula spilling out like liquid starlight, perfectly mirroring the swirling waves crashing below. The storm, impossibly, seems to bend *around* this breathtaking vision.



“Captain!” someone finally shouts. I look over. It's Harding at the helm. His face isn't gray. It’s... beaming. "**The storm’s receding! What did you DO?!**”



I just look down at the pulsing jade turtle, warm now against my palm, and say, without conviction or entirely understanding, "We followed the song…”

Then the turtle vanishes, melting away like captured sunlight, and I wake up. The weight of a strange longing clinging to me like the memory of sea air... a green flash imprinted in my mind...
