...and find that it is not resting on an easel, but hanging suspended in the swirling air, absolutely perfect in its emptiness.

The canvas is the only thing in this riotous existence that is truly, utterly still. Everything else—the geometry that folds like wet paper, the acid-green sky that dissolves into tangerine dust, the hum of impossible violet—is in motion.

I reach out a hand, drawn by the silence the canvas seems to emit. My fingers expect fabric or wood, but they encounter a surface that feels like hardened, cold moonlight.

The moment my skin touches the white, the chaos around me seems to recognize its master. There is no sound of rushing paint, but the colors of the world instantly react. The nearest forms—a melting pillar of chrome and a waterfall of brilliant indigo—do not drip onto the canvas; they are *sucked* into it.

The blank space begins to bloom not with pigment, but with pure *memory*.

The edges of the canvas warp slightly, and the captured colors condense into an image of impossible clarity: a single, perfectly rendered, silent room. It is a room from a life I cannot quite recall, bathed in the soft, unchanging light of a dawn that lasts forever. The air inside the frame is thick and still, smelling faintly of old paper and dust.

I realize the canvas is not meant to be painted upon; it is a portal. It is a perfect, rectangular cut of stillness carved out of perpetual motion.

As I stare, the scene within the frame solidifies, becoming three-dimensional and inviting. I feel the distinct pull of *escape*. Without hesitating, I place one foot tentatively into the surface, which gives way like heavy water.

I step completely through the blank canvas and into the still, dusty silence of the memory-room. The roar of the colorful chaos instantly vanishes behind me. I look back, but the entrance has collapsed, leaving only a white, seamless wall.

In the center of the room is a small wooden table, and on the table sits a single, perfectly ripe, crimson apple. I walk toward it, knowing that if I touch it, the stillness will shatter, and the next sequence of the dream will begin.
