You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships – the perpetually grey skies choked with metallic dust, the rust-streaked skeletons of skyscrapers clawing at a battered dome – you decided to **collect seeds.** 

You weren’t sure why, exactly. It wasn’t that the world *told* you to, but a flicker of stubborn hope, buried deep within the hollow of a scavenging gut, kept you moving. You weren't looking for a miracle, just…continuity. Each carefully chosen seed, each discarded piece of corrugated metal, represented a potential future – a future you hadn’t consciously planned for, a future born from a long-dead memory of blooming orchards and sun-drenched fields.

Following a faint discoloration in a particularly brittle patch of crumbling asphalt, you stumbled upon a hidden, walled garden. It was small – hardly bigger than a single person – but it contained a riot of unexpected colour. Lavender bushes clung to walls coated with damp moss, sprawling vines of bright scarlet bloomed amongst pockets of stubbornly grey concrete, and a single, perfect strawberry patch dominated the landscape, its fruit glistening unnaturally under a perpetually filtered sun. 

As you approached, you saw movement. A small, weathered woman – named Lyra, her hair the colour of faded linen – sat by a small, bubbling stream, coaxing a miniature fern to life with intricate gestures and whispered pleas to the damp soil. She smiled – a genuine, surprisingly vibrant smile – and offered you a tiny cup of crimson- coloured tea. 


"They don't remember it fondly," she said, wiping a drop of tea from her sleeve. “Said all the colors were an unwelcome trespass. But these…these are a different kind of remembering.”

She showed you her garden – a testament to survival, stubbornly resilient life pushing through the ruins. "The earth remembers," she chuckled, holding up a chipped ceramic jar filled with tiny, bioluminescent mushrooms.  “It finds a way.  And we’re here to tend it.”

Suddenly, you felt a small prick in your side - a mosquito buzzing around your forehead. The darkness tightened, deepening with the metallic grit of the air. You realized, with mounting alarm, that the rain wasn’t a normal rain, it was…grey.  You began to collect the seeds with frantic purpose, the warmth spreading through your hands – not from human contact, but from the earth pulling upwards. It was a small victory – a single sprig of blueberry, nestled in a smooth stone, tasting subtly of rain and something…else. 

Your instinct, amplified and strangely insistent, became simple: **start building.** Not a shelter, not a fortress. But something small – a signal, a gesture, a tiny patch of beauty clinging to a landscape where none could grow easily. You started gathering fragments of smooth metal, interwoven with brightly colored wildflowers, and began to subtly arrange them, creating a mosaic on the crumbling wall, a silent promise whispered against the bleak horizon. 

The dream was fracturing, morphing with the insistent weight of the earth and the delicate urgency of the tiny seeds.
