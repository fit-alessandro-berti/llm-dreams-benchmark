...feel the walls beginning to shift and breathe around you. The geometric patterns on the floor start to ripple like water, and suddenly you realize you can see the solutions to the puzzles written in languages you've never learned but somehow understand perfectly.

As you reach for the next puzzle—a crystalline cube that hums with mathematical equations—your hand passes through it like mist. The maze begins to fold in on itself, corridors becoming möbius strips, and you find yourself walking on the ceiling, which has become a garden of inverted trees with roots reaching toward a star-filled void below.

In the distance, you hear the sound of your childhood piano playing a melody you composed but never wrote down. Following the music, you discover that each puzzle you've solved has transformed into a glowing butterfly, and they're all dancing in a spiral pattern that spells out a message you can almost—but not quite—read.

The final door of the maze is actually a mirror, and when you look into it, you see yourself as a child, an elder, and your current self all superimposed, all holding different pieces of the same cosmic puzzle. As you reach out to touch the glass, you realize the maze was inside you all along, and you wake up with the strange sensation that you've forgotten something vitally important, but gained something else you can't quite name.
