stand up for your beliefs while respecting their perspective. You calmly express how the issue affects you personally and why it matters so deeply. Instead of raising voices or resorting to harsh words, you both take turns speaking your truths with sincerity. This open dialogue leads to a deeper understanding between each other; although no immediate resolution is reached, there's mutual respect left by acknowledging differing opinions without judgment—knowing that such honesty strengthens rather than weakens the bond shared as friends.
