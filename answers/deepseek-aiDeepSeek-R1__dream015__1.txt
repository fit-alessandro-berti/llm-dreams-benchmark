**Dream Continuation:**  
...scavenge the ruins of an old research facility on the horizon, driven by rumors of a hidden seed vault that could restore plant life. Your backpack holds little—a canteen, a rusted wrench, and a hand-drawn map bartered for three cans of beans. The air reeks of ozone, and distant howls echo as you pick through collapsed labs.  

Inside, flickering emergency lights reveal overgrown hydroponic pods, long abandoned. A rat scuttles past a skeleton in a lab coat clutching a journal. Its final entry speaks of a *"last-strain wheat, immune to the Blight"* stored in Sublevel 5. But the elevator shaft is a gaping void, and the stairs are clogged with irradiated fungus.  

As you rig a rope from cables, a shadow moves—a scarred figure aims a crossbow at your chest. "Turn back," they rasp. "That vault’s a myth." But their eyes flicker with fear, not malice. Behind them, a faint green glow pulses under a sealed door…  

**Do you negotiate, fight, or risk the fungal stairs?** The dream fractures here, the weight of choice lingering like static before you wake.
