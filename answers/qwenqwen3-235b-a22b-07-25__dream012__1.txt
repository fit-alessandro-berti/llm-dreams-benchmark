...feel the wheel shudder in your hands like a living thing trying to tear itself free. Icy spray stings my face, blinding me for a second. Through the lashing rain, I see First Mate Elara gripping the mainmast shroud, her eyes wide with more than just fear – there's *recognition* in them. Recognition of something impossible.

"Captain!" she screams over the gale, pointing not at the mountainous waves swallowing the bow, but at the sky itself. "Look! The *stars*!"

I wrench my gaze upwards. The storm clouds should be an impenetrable bruise, but they’re *tearing*. Not parting, *tearing*, like rotten fabric. And through the rents, it’s not the familiar constellations that shine. It’s *lightning*, but wrong. Jagged, silent, and woven from colors that haven't names – deep violets that hum, sickly greens that pulse like a dying heart. And within that fractured, alien aurora, shapes coalesce. Not clouds, but *eyes*. Enormous, lidless, and impossibly ancient, they blink slowly across the vastness of the sky, each pupil a vortex of collapsing stars.

The roar of the wind, the crash of waves, the terrified shouts of the crew – they all recede into a muffled thrum, like listening through water. The cold dread in my gut isn’t just of the storm anymore. This is *worse*. This is the terror of scale, the realization that our struggle is insignificant, a frantic dance before cosmic indifference.

Elara stumbles towards me, slipping on the heaving deck. "They're *awake*," she gasps, seawater and tears mingling on her cheeks. "The stories... the old sea-lore... the Sleeper Beneath the Waves... it wasn't metaphor. It's *them*! We woke them with our noise, our lights, our *daring* to cross *here*!"

A wave, taller than the mainmast, looms, green and terrible. But I don't flinch. My eyes are locked on the colossal eye directly above the ship. It doesn't just observe; it *perceives*. And in its depths, I don't see anger, not exactly. I see... *curiosity*. A detached, incomprehensible interest, like a child about to poke an ant with a stick.

The wave crashes over the deck. Water, thick and cold as oil, fills my mouth, my nose. The ship groans, a sound of tortured timber. But as the water recedes, dragging a sailor screaming into the churning dark, I’m still on my feet, the wheel forgotten. The spectral eyes in the sky are fading, the tears in the clouds knitting shut as quickly as they appeared. The storm itself seems to lose its malice, becoming merely chaotic wind and water again.

Silence, relative and heavy, falls as the gale lessens. The crew huddles, shivering, staring at the now-normal, starless sky, then at me. Elara crawls to her knees, her face ashen. "Captain... what... what *was* that?"

I look down at my hands. They’re shaking, not from cold or fear, but from the afterimage burned onto my retina. The impossible geometry of that pupil. The silent hum in my bones. I open my mouth to answer, to offer some lie of reassurance, but the words die.

Because in the dark, oily water swirling around my boots, I see it. Reflected. Not my own face. But a ripple, a distortion... and for a fleeting second, the curve of that same colossal, lidless eye, *looking back* from the depth of the sea beneath my feet. The Captain never reached the shore.
