...and you begin to open your mouth, but no sound comes out. You push harder, a frantic breath escaping, but it's like your voice has vanished, replaced by a strange, echoing silence that seems to grow louder than any sound could ever be.

The expectant faces of the audience begin to blur, their features melting and reforming into something indistinct, like watching heat haze rise from asphalt. The grand hall around you starts to stretch and distort, the walls rippling like water, the ceiling dissolving into a swirling mist that isn't quite dark, but holds no light either.

You glance down at your hands gripping the sides of the podium, but they're not quite your hands – they're too long, too thin, and covered in something that looks like bark. The podium itself feels strangely soft, like clay, molding under your touch.

Panic tries to claw its way up, but it's muffled, distant, as if happening to someone else. The silent, shifting audience leans closer, not with expectation anymore, but with a quiet, consuming presence. You try desperately to remember the first line of your speech, or even just your name, but the words crumble into dust in your mind.

The stage floor beneath your feet gives way, not falling, but turning into a field of soft, shimmering grass under a sky filled with two moons, one blue, one green. The crowd is gone, replaced by tall, silent trees with leaves that whisper secrets you can almost understand, if you just listen harder... but the echo of the impossible silence still hums in your ears.
