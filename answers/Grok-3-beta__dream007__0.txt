take a step back and suggest a walk outside to cool off. As you both step out into the crisp evening air, the tension begins to ease. You walk in silence for a while, the sound of your footsteps on the pavement and the distant hum of the city filling the space between you. The argument still lingers in your mind, but the open sky and the gentle breeze seem to soften the edges of your frustration.

After a few minutes, you find yourselves at a small park you used to visit together as kids. The old wooden bench by the pond is still there, weathered but familiar. You both sit down without a word, watching the ducks glide across the water. The silence feels less heavy now, more like a shared moment of reflection.

Finally, your friend speaks, their voice quieter than before. “I didn’t mean to hurt you with what I said earlier. I just… I care about this a lot, you know?” You nod, feeling the weight of their words. You realize you’ve both been so caught up in being right that you forgot how much you value each other’s perspectives. 

“I get it,” you reply, your own voice softer now. “I think we’re both just passionate about this. Maybe we can find a middle ground if we really listen to each other.” Your friend looks at you, a small smile breaking through the tension. They nod, and for the first time in what feels like hours, you both feel a sense of understanding.

As the sun begins to set, casting a warm golden glow over the park, you feel a strange shift. The ducks on the pond start to shimmer, their shapes blurring into something else entirely. Suddenly, the park around you begins to dissolve, the bench beneath you fading into a soft, misty void. You turn to your friend, but they’re no longer there. Instead, you’re standing alone in a vast, surreal landscape where the ground is made of glass, reflecting endless swirling colors beneath your feet.

A voice echoes from nowhere and everywhere at once, whispering, “What do you truly want to resolve?” You feel a pull in your chest, as if the question is drawing something deep from within you. Before you can answer, the glass beneath you cracks, and you start to fall into the kaleidoscope of colors below. 

As you tumble through the shifting hues, memories of past arguments, laughter, and unspoken feelings with your friend flash around you like fragments of a broken mirror. Each piece reflects a moment you thought was forgotten, and you realize there’s more to this disagreement than just the surface issue. There’s a deeper truth you’ve both been avoiding.

Just as you’re about to hit the bottom of this endless fall, you wake up, heart pounding, still feeling the weight of that unanswered question lingering in your mind. The room is dark, and the quiet of reality feels almost too still compared to the vivid chaos of the dream. You lie there, wondering if you should call your friend in the morning to talk things through for real.
