**Dream Completion:**  

…accept their invitation, though you don’t know why you trust them. Their faces are indistinct, but their voices hum with warmth, like sunlight on old stone. One holds out a lantern that glows with a soft, blue light—*"Follow this,"* they say, *"it carries the direction you’ve forgotten."*  

The city’s noise fades as you walk, the streets twisting into unfamiliar alleys draped in ivy and twinkling fairy lights. The strangers murmur stories as you go—tales of lost travelers who became founders of bridges, of compasses hidden in heartbeats. The lantern’s light spills onto the cobblestones, forming a map only you can read. Names of places you’ve never visited feel suddenly dear: *Moonbell Lane, The Threshold Gardens, the Fountain of Falling Hours*.  

When you pause at a crossroads, the group steps back, blending into the shadows. *"You’ll dream the way home now,"* one whispers. The lantern dissolves into fireflies, swirling upward to outline a door in the air—a portal shimmering with the faint sound of a melody you used to know.  

You step through… and wake, not in a bed, but on a park bench at dawn, the city quiet for the first time. In your palm, a maple key rests, its wings etched with tiny, glowing words: *"Lostness is just pilgrimage in disguise."*  

The dream lingers. You’re still alone, but the ache is softer now. Somewhere, strangers are laughing, and the air smells of rain and possibility.
