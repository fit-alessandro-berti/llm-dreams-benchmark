You’re at your workplace, staring at the whiteboard filled with scattered tasks, when suddenly the room shifts—like a memory slipping through glass. Your boss appears, their expression calm yet urgent, hands resting on the desk as if holding invisible weights.

You’re handed a single folder with a project title you barely recognize: *“Rebuild the Global Echo System by Zero Time.”* The deadline is tomorrow—neutral, impossible. Impossible like trying to build a cathedral in a hurricane.

You glance at the clock: *11:47 p.m.* The boss says nothing more, but their gaze holds gravity. You feel the pressure—not just from the clock, but from the weight of the unknown. What *is* this project? A system that predicts quantum shifts? A reforestation initiative across continents that must be complete before spring? Or something far stranger?

You sit down at your desk, fingers hovering over the first file—*not a blueprint, not a brief, but a single page with a cryptic note in the corner: “Time is a river. Cross it before it floods.”*

Suddenly, the office feels smaller, then larger—too quiet, then alive with voices not yet spoken. You feel the familiar stir of focus blending with awe. This isn’t just a deadline. It’s a door. And you stand at its threshold, ready to walk through.
