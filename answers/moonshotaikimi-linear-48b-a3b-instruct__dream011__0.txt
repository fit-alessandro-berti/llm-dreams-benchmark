… written in your own handwriting.

The room is silent, fluorescent lights humming overhead. You blink—once, twice—at the thick exam booklet open in front of you. The title page reads:

**“Advanced Concepts in Personal Destiny: Final Assessment”**

No professor. No rows of desks. Just you and the questions.

You flip to the first page.

---

**Question 1:**  
*Describe the moment you decided to take this exam.*

---

You frown. That part of your memory feels… slippery. Like a word on the tip of your tongue. You stare at the question, and slowly, the ink on the page begins to shift.

It’s your handwriting, alright. But younger. More uncertain. It rewrites itself, curling into something else entirely.

*Describe the moment you decided to take this exam.*

You hesitate, then write.

---

*I don’t remember deciding. I just woke up one day and filled out the form. My hands did it. My future took the wheel. I think I was tired of choosing… so I let the test choose for me.*

---

The paper vibrates slightly. The ink dries.

**Question 2:**  
*Which question would you most want to ask yourself?*

---

You pause. This one doesn’t feel like a test question. More like a riddle. Or a confession.

You write again.

---

*“Would you still trust yourself if you knew how much of your life you survived by accident?”*

---

The page stays still this time. But the room shifts.

A breeze moves through the air, though no windows open. You hear soft footsteps—maybe heels, maybe bare feet. Someone is walking toward your desk.

You don’t look up.

The footsteps stop.

“You’re not supposed to remember your future,” you hear. A voice—soft, familiar, but not quite yours.

You do look now.

The person standing over you is wearing your face, but older. Their eyes are tired in a way you haven’t earned yet.

“You’re doing fine,” they say. “But the exam only ends when you stop writing.”

You look down.

You’re already done. The final blank line waits, untouched.

**Final Question:**  
*What happens next?*

---

You sit in silence for a long time.

Then you close the exam booklet.

You stand up.

The room begins to fade, like ink washed in rain.

As it disappears, you realize: the exam was never the point.

It was the waiting that mattered.

You take your first step forward.

And the dream ends.
