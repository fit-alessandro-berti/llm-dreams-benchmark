…not written in words, but in a series of shifting, glowing symbols that seem to swirl and rearrange themselves as you look at them. They pulse faintly, almost like a heartbeat, and for reasons you can’t explain, you *feel* their meaning rather than read it.  

The first "question" isn't a question at all—it’s an image in your mind: you are standing at the edge of a vast, dark lake at night. The moon’s reflection on the surface ripples in the wind. A voice, soft but urgent, whispers from nowhere and everywhere at once: *Choose wisely, for every ripple changes the shore.*  

You glance around at the other students, hoping to see some shared confusion, but they're all writing furiously, their pens scratching at the paper like they’ve been preparing for this their whole lives. You look back at your own exam sheet—and your name has melted away, replaced with a blank space.

A second question forms, and this time it isn’t just symbols—it’s a memory you never had. You’re walking through a crowded city made of rain, where the buildings dissolve if you stare at them too long. People pass by, each holding fragments of your handwriting on slips of paper, but no one will meet your eyes. At the center of the street is a door suspended in the air, slowly swinging open and closed.  

You somehow know—without anyone telling you—that to finish the exam, you have to decide whether to walk through that door, even though you can’t see what’s on the other side.  

Your heart races. Somewhere beyond the test hall, you hear waves crashing, louder and louder, like they’re coming closer, invading the building. The symbols on your paper begin to flash, forming a question you *can’t quite read but completely understand*:  

*What will you give up to pass?*

Would you like me to continue the dream into its surreal conclusion, or leave it on this tense cliffhanger?
