...and the obstacles begin to shift from the physical to the conceptual. The other competitors—shadowy figures whose faces I can never quite focus on—are falling away, leaving me alone in a corridor that stretches infinitely upward, like an M.C. Escher painting reimagined by a computer.

The first challenge is a room filled with millions of fluttering pieces of paper, each one a question. "What is the color of wind?" one asks. "How do you hug a memory?" asks another. I realize the goal isn't to answer them, but to catch the one question that matters most. I stop running and stand still, letting the paper storm whip around me, until a single card drifts gently into my palm. It reads: *"What would you do if you knew you could not fail?"*

The floor dissolves, and I fall gently into the second challenge: The Maze of Ambiguity. The walls are made of fog, and the path changes every time I take a breath. A voice echoes from the ceiling—my own voice, but deeper—saying, "There is no right path, only the one you take." I close my eyes and walk forward with total confidence. When I open them, the fog has solidified into a bridge made of light, carrying me across a chasm of silence.

Finally, I reach the Grand Hall. At the end of a long table sits the Judge, a figure composed entirely of prism-light, refracting the room into rainbows. The Judge places a single object before me: an empty glass box.

"For the dream job," the Judge whispers, the sound vibrating in my chest. "Fill it."

I look around for tools, but there are none. I look at the other competitors, who are frantically trying to fill their boxes with gold, or clocks, or trophies. I realize that my dream job isn't about the title, or the prize, or the finish line. It is about the capacity to hold potential.

I step forward and open the lid of the box. I don't put anything inside. Instead, I simply hold it up to the light, letting the prism-Judge shine through it, scattering beautiful colors across the room.

"Perfect," the Judge says. "You understand that the job is not to own, but to transmit."

The glass box vanishes, and in my hand appears a key made of starlight. The doors at the end of the hall swing open, revealing not an office, but an endless, beautiful horizon of unexplored worlds. I step through, ready to begin.

I wake up with a start, my heart racing, but a strange sense of peace settling over me. I realize I haven't missed the opportunity; I've just been given the blueprint.
