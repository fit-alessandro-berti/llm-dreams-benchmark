and you find yourself swept along with them, their laughter and easy conversation a soft buffer against the clamor of the streets. They lead you down winding alleys you never would have noticed, past murals glowing with impossible colors and cafés you didn’t know existed, until you emerge into a little pocket of green — a rooftop garden strung with lights, above the chaos below.

Someone presses a warm cup into your hands. Someone else points out how small the city looks from up here. In their company, the feeling of being lost dissolves into something lighter. You realize that maybe you were never meant to navigate all of this alone.

You sit among the flowers and twinkling bulbs, the city humming like a heartbeat beneath you, and a sense of belonging settles over you. The scene begins to blur and soften, and as you wake, the memory of kind faces and unexpected paths lingers like sunlight on your skin.
