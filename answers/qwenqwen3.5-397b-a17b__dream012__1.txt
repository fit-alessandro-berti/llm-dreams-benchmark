...and you realize the wheel beneath your hands is not wood, but warm, living stone. You do not shout orders. Instead, you close your eyes and hum a low, steady note that vibrates through the deck and into the churning water.

As the sound spreads, the lightning stops striking and begins to hang in the air like golden vines. The waves, once towering monsters, flatten into sheets of obsidian glass. Your crew does not cheer; they look down at their hands and watch as their fingers turn into sea foam, drifting gently upward into the clouds.

You understand then that the ship was never floating on the water, but hanging from the sky. The storm was not an attack, but a cocoon. You let go of the wheel, and it dissolves into a flock of moths. You are no longer the captain; you are the wind, and finally, you are free to wake up.
