You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, you start to notice that the puzzles are no longer just on the walls—they are forming in your mind. The maze itself seems to be alive, shifting and rearranging based on your thoughts. After what feels like an eternity, you reach a dead end with a single mirror. Your reflection stares back, but its lips move independently: "The final puzzle is to let go." You take a deep breath, close your eyes, and when you open them again, the maze is gone. You wake up, the lingering sense of mystery already fading into the comfort of your bed.
