You are dreaming. Let me complete the dream for you...

You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a swirling, indecipherable script that keeps shifting like liquid mercury on the page. At first, you think it's just your nerves playing tricks, but as you blink, the words morph into images—familiar faces from your past staring back at you with accusing eyes, whispering fragments of forgotten conversations.

Your heart races as you flip through the pages, only to find that the questions aren't about the subject you studied at all. Instead, they're absurd riddles: "What color is the sound of your first heartbreak?" and "How many shadows did you leave behind in your dreams last night?" You glance around the room, but the other students are gone, replaced by shadowy figures that flicker like old film reels, their forms twisting and elongating as if the air itself is alive.

Panic sets in as you try to write an answer, but your pen dissolves into sand, slipping through your fingers. The clock on the wall ticks backward, and suddenly, you're not in a classroom anymore—you're floating in a vast, endless void, where the exam paper expands into a starry sky, pulling you in. You hear a distant voice, maybe your own, laughing maniacally, saying, "This is your future, rewritten."

Just as the void threatens to swallow you whole, you jolt awake in your bed, drenched in sweat, the remnants of the dream fading like mist. You sit up, relieved it's over, but a nagging thought lingers: maybe that exam was a metaphor for something real you need to face. What do you think—want to explore another twist in the dream?
