feel the air thicken like wet wool against your skin. The pines sway violently, needles hissing like crackling static. A single black-feathered bird—too large to be a crow, too silent to be a raven—glides between the trunks and circles you once, twice, then drops something at your feet: a small brass key still warm from the bird’s body.

The moment your fingers close around it, thunder rolls through the soil itself, as if the earth has lungs and has just exhaled. The path ahead forks into three trails you swear were not there moments ago. One trail is lit by ordinary afternoon light—that seems safest. Another is drenched in violet dusk that shouldn’t fall for hours. The third plunges into moonlit night, though you can still see daylight high above the canopy.

Your heartbeat syncs with a distant, slow drum. Somewhere, a voice that feels like your own childhood whispers, *The storm is the key.* The key pulses in your palm, matching the drum, and you understand—though you cannot say how—that whichever path you choose will change only the sky you walk beneath, not the storm arriving inside you.
