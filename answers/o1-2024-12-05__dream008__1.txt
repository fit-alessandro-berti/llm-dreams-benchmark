…step forward to your desk. The office lights seem a little too bright, buzzing overhead like a nervous chorus. You notice the clock on the wall reads 3:17 p.m., but the second hand is moving backward. Your boss stands at the edge of your cubicle, arms crossed, tapping her foot. Her face blurs at the edges whenever you try to focus on it. She clears her throat, and when she speaks, her voice sounds as though it’s coming through a crackling speaker at the far end of a tunnel.

“All eyes are on you,” she says. Her words hang in the air, and you notice a dozen coworkers peering over the tops of their half-walls as if on cue. You have to begin this project—an enormous stack of papers, a labyrinth of spreadsheets—right now. The only instructions are scrawled in jagged handwriting on a single sticky note that’s begun to peel off the monitor. “Finish by the time the fire alarm rings,” the note reads.

You sit down, your chair too high and then too low, adjusting itself without your input. Your computer monitor flickers, showing a half-finished presentation that suddenly transitions into a looping video of a watch’s hands spinning at impossible speeds. Every keystroke you make is followed by a faint echo. You type your name in the search bar, only to find instructions written in riddle form: “To begin, lose what you cannot keep. To finish, find what you cannot see.”

The deadline is impossible, yet you know you must try. Outside the window, the sky has taken on a deep orange hue. Clouds shaped like file folders drift by lazily. Your boss leans in and whispers something you can’t quite make out—something about patience and panic. Your heart flutters. You try to open the project files, but they keep fracturing into more folders, more subfolders, each named after a feeling you thought you left behind: “Doubt,” “Hesitation,” “Fear.” You try to open “Hope,” but it’s empty.

You look around. Your coworkers have disappeared. Instead, cardboard cutouts of them remain, each frozen in a posture of encouragement or disappointment. The air begins to feel thick, and the overhead lights dim. The second hand on the wall clock is not only moving backward now, but it’s warping into different shapes—a pen, a feather, a tiny ladder. The buzzing overhead grows louder, and you realize it’s not just the lights; it’s the hum of your own anxious thoughts.

Your boss steps forward and places a heavy binder in front of you. Its cover is blank except for a question mark drawn in red ink. You crack it open, and inside, there’s just a single line scrawled on the first page: “The deadline is the moment you understand.”

As you read this, a gentle chime rings out. You glance at the corner of your screen—an email notification. It’s from yourself, sent from a time that doesn’t exist on the calendar. You open it, and it says simply: “Slow down.”

You realize in this dream logic that completing the project isn’t about finishing a task, but reconciling the contradictions swirling in your mind. The tighter you cling to control, the further the solution slips away. You take a deep breath. The second hand on the clock slows, the overhead buzz recedes. Your boss’s face comes into sharper focus, now looking patient rather than angry.

You open one of the folders—the one labeled “Hesitation”—and inside, instead of endless data, there’s a blank field waiting for you to type something, anything. You type, “I will try, and that’s enough.” The page glows softly, the binder’s question mark fades, and the impossible deadline begins to feel less like a countdown to failure and more like an invitation to trust yourself.

In that moment, the ceiling seems to lift away, the office walls stretching into a pleasant, infinite space. The workspace grows quiet and peaceful. Your boss no longer looms over you; instead, she offers a nod. Outside, the orange sky dissolves into a calm blue. You think you hear distant birdsong. The fire alarm never rings.

You wake up—somewhere between relief and recognition that what felt impossible may have been nothing more than your own fear dressed up in office attire.
