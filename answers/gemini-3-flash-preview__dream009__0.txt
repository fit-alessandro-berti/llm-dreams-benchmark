The silence is what strikes me first. There is no hum of a refrigerator, no distant drone of traffic, no haptic vibration of a phone—just the heavy, rhythmic thrum of a world powered by wood, wind, and muscle. 

I am lying on a straw mattress that smells of dried chamomile and dust. Sunlight filters through a pane of distorted, hand-blown glass, casting amber ripples across a floor of wide oak planks. My clothes are heavy—coarse linen and boiled wool—and my pockets are empty of the smooth plastic rectangles I once relied on. Outside the window, a blacksmith’s hammer strikes an anvil in a steady, musical cadence, and the air is thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth.

As I explore my new surroundings, stepping out into a village of thatched roofs and mud-slicked lanes, I realize I need to **locate the Clockmaker of Aethelgard before the final bell tolls.**

I have a strange, phantom sensation in my mind—a residual memory of "data" and "connectivity"—but here, information travels only as fast as a horse can gallop. I understand instinctively that I haven't just traveled through time; I have been "downloaded" into a living history. In my vest pocket, I find a single, inexplicable object: a small, translucent gear made of a material that hasn't been invented yet.

I begin to run, my leather boots slipping on the stones. I need to find the one man who understands the language of mechanics in this age of superstition. If I can help him finish the Great Orrery in the town square, we can align the copper spheres to the exact coordinates of the stars I remember. Only then can I send a signal back through the currents of time—not with electricity, but with the precise, ticking heartbeat of a thousand perfectly synchronized gears—to tell the world I’m awake.
