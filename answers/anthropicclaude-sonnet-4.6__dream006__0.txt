...reach for the microphone stand, but your fingers pass right through it like smoke. A ripple of unease moves through you, but the audience doesn't seem to notice. They're still watching, patient and luminous, their faces somehow both familiar and completely unrecognizable — like people you've known in other lifetimes.

You clear your throat and open your mouth, and what comes out is not words exactly, but something closer to **color**. Deep blues and warm ambers drift from your lips like visible breath in cold air, curling up toward the rafters. The audience leans forward, enchanted rather than confused.

You look down at your notes, but the pages are covered not in your speech but in a map of a coastline you've never visited, with a single red X marked somewhere offshore, beneath the water.

Somehow you understand that *this is the speech*. The map. The colors. All of it.

You speak for what feels like an hour — in metaphors you couldn't repeat upon waking, in sentences that fold back on themselves like origami — and the audience is **weeping**, but happily, the way people cry at reunions or at the end of beautiful music.

When you finish, the silence is enormous and warm.

A child in the front row raises her hand and asks:

*"But did you remember to check the tide?"*

And just as you realize you know exactly what she means—

you wake up.
