*continues the dream narrative*

...and you realize that you must act quickly to ensure the safety of your crew and vessel. The wind howls and the waves crash against the sides of the ship, threatening to overturn it at any moment.

You rush to the helm, grasping the wheel tightly as you struggle to maintain control. \ the sails!\ you shout over the roar of the storm. \Batten down the hatches and make sure all cargo is tied down!\ crew springs into action, following your commands without hesitation.

As you navigate through the treacherous waters, a flash of lightning illuminates the sky, revealing a massive wave heading straight towards your ship. You brace yourself, gritting your teeth as the wave hits, sending a shudder through the entire vessel. Water pours onto the deck, but your crew remains steadfast, working tirelessly to keep the ship afloat.

Just when all seems lost, you spot a glimmer of hope on the horizon - a lighthouse, its beacon cutting through the darkness. With renewed determination, you steer your ship towards the light, knowing that safety lies just beyond the storm.

As you approach the lighthouse, the storm begins to subside, and the seas grow calmer. Your crew cheers as you guide the ship into the shelter of the bay, the lighthouse standing tall and proud above you. You breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that your quick thinking and the bravery of your crew have saved the day.

As you step off the ship onto solid ground, you can't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. You have faced the storm and emerged victorious, a true captain and leader to your crew.
