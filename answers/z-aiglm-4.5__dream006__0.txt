You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to... feel the weight of utterly perfect silence pressing down on you. The auditorium is vast, a cavern of shadow pierced by a single, blinding spotlight pinning you to the polished wooden floor. The faces blur into an expectant sea – thousands of eyes reflecting the light like tiny, liquid stars.

You open your mouth, but the prepared words, carefully rehearsed, have evaporated like mist in sunlight. Panic, cold and slick, starts to coil in your stomach. You fumble for the microphone stand... and find only empty air. The microphone is gone. A wave of nervous heat washes over you, and you instinctively reach up to adjust your collar.

Just as your fingers brush the fabric, something shifts. The expectant faces lose their focus. Whispers, low and indistinct, like wind through dry reeds, begin to rustle through the audience. It's not hostility you sense, but... *impatience*. A collective leaning forward, a subtle tensing of shoulders. The silence, once heavy, now feels brittle, charged with an energy that vibrates up through the soles of your shoes and into your bones. It’s the silence before judgment.

Your heart hammers against your ribs. This is it. The speech is gone, the microphone vanished, the audience restless. You should be frozen, mortified. But instead, a strange, dreamlike calm settles. absurdity of the situation hits you. *You're dreaming.* The realization isn't a thought, it's a wave washing through your entire being, dissolving the panic.

You look down at your hands. They seem translucent for a moment. You take a deep breath, filling lungs that feel lighter than air. The pressure lifts. The whispers fade, replaced by a profound stillness that is not threatening, but *waiting*. Waiting not for perfect words, but for *your* truth.

You look up at the sea of blurred faces. You don't need the microphone. You don't need the speech. You smile, a genuine, unforced smile that feels like sunshine breaking through cloud. And you begin to *speak*.

Not with words you memorized, but with the stuff of the dream itself. You speak of the feeling of falling endlessly and landing softly. You speak of colors that have sound and notes that taste like honey. You describe the vast, star-strewn night sky you suddenly see materializing on the ceiling of the auditorium. The audience doesn't gasp; they *lean in*, their faces sharpening now, not with expectation, but with shared wonder.

As you gesture, describing the spiral of a galaxy, shimmering lines of light trail from your fingertips, painting constellations across the darkness above the stage. The words you speak don't just leave your mouth; they float in the air before you, visible as soft, glowing letters that drift gently towards the audience like luminous dandelion seeds. People reach out occasionally, letting the light brush their skin, and smiles bloom.

There's no applause when you finish describing the silence between the stars. There's just a shared, profound hum of understanding, a collective intake of breath that feels like the whole auditorium sighing in contentment. The spotlight softens, bathing everything in a warm, golden light. You feel not relief, but quiet joy, a sense of connection deep and wordless.

You turn, not knowing why, and walk to the edge of the stage. There's no exit door. Instead, a set of stone steps materialize, leading down not to the auditorium floor, but into a tranquil garden bathed in moonlight, filled with night-blooming flowers whose fragrance you can suddenly smell. You step down, one foot on the cool grass, the dream of the speech fading like the last notes of a song, leaving only the scent of jasmine and the feeling of having spoken, and been perfectly, silently heard.
