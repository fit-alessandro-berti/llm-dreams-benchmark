You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to wander the labyrinthine streets, where buildings twist like living vines, their windows glowing with an ethereal blue light that pulses in rhythm with your heartbeat. The air hums with a distant symphony of voices—whispers in languages you've never heard, overlapping like echoes in a forgotten cave.

Panic flickers at the edges of your mind, but curiosity pulls you forward. You hail a cab that materializes from the fog, its driver a shadowy figure with eyes like polished obsidian. "Take me to the meeting," you say, but the driver chuckles, a sound like rustling leaves. "Which one? The one with the kings of the clouds or the queens of the underground rivers?" The cab lurches into motion, weaving through avenues lined with street performers who juggle orbs of liquid starlight, their faces shifting from human to avian mid-act.

Time warps around you—the hourglass in your pocket (wait, when did you pick that up?) runs backward, sand cascading upward. You check your watch, but the hands spin wildly, pointing to impossible hours like 3:17 in the afternoon of yesterday. The cab stops abruptly at a towering spire that wasn't there moments ago, its doors carved with runes that spell out your name in glowing script. Inside, the meeting unfolds in a chamber of floating crystals, where attendees are not people but manifestations of your thoughts: a stern version of your boss argues with a playful echo of your childhood self, while a flock of paper birds delivers agendas written in invisible ink.

You try to speak, but your words emerge as colorful bubbles that pop into bursts of laughter. The discussion veers into absurdity—debating the ethics of dreaming while awake—until the room begins to dissolve, the crystals melting into a river of light that carries you away. Suddenly, the urgency fades; the meeting was never about deadlines but about rediscovering the city's hidden heartbeat.

As the dream unravels, you float upward, the city shrinking to a glittering map below. You wake with a start, the echo of that laughter lingering in your ears, wondering if the meeting was real after all—or if you're still dreaming.
