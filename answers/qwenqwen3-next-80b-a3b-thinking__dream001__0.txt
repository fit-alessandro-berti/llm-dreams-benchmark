Your pulse hammers in your throat as you stand on a cobblestone street that feels oddly spongy, like walking on dried seaweed. The city around you is a labyrinth of impossible geometry: towers lean at 45-degree angles, their windows glowing with shifting colors—violet, emerald, then raw mercury—while streets spiral upward like vanishing points in a fever-drawn sketch. The air smells of ozone and burnt sugar, thick enough to taste. You check your hands: no watch, no phone, no notes—just bare skin and the crushing knowledge that your *important meeting* is less than an hour away, though you can’t remember *what* meeting, *where*, or *who* for.  

You start to run.  

Your footsteps echo strangely, as if the city is hollow beneath you. A street sign reads *“Regret Avenue”*, but when you blink, it flickers to *“Hope Boulevard”*—then dissolves into gibberish. People pass you, their faces blurred smudges of charcoal, clothes stitching together and unraveling as they move. One pauses, whispering, “Time’s a river here,” before stepping sideways *through* a brick wall and vanishing.  

You duck into an alley where neon signs buzz like trapped insects. A single door, painted the color of a bruise, stands ajar. Peering inside, you see a vast, empty room with a single oak table in the center. A single chair sits opposite it. On the table: a single sheet of paper. Your breath catches. *The meeting?*  

You step inside. The door slams shut behind you. In the silence, the air grows cold. You approach the table and read the paper:  

> **"You have arrived exactly on time.  
> The meeting is with yourself.  
> Take the chair.  
> Do not look away."**  

Your reflection appears in the polished wood—not distorted, but *older*. Wiser. Weary, but calm. It meets your eyes and holds your gaze. The frantic pounding of your heart slows. The city outside the window—the twisting towers, the shifting streets—freezes. Even the buzzing neon dies to silence.  

For the first time in the dream, you understand: you’re not late. You were *always* exactly where you needed to be.  
The chair feels warm beneath you.  
You sit down.  
And begin to listen.  

---  
*You wake with sunlight on your face, the dream’s clarity lingering like mist. The alarm hasn’t rung. You’re in your own bed. But for a moment, you feel strangely ready.*
