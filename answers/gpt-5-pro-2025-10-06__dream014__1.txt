…and you follow, unsure but grateful.

They move like a small school of fish through the crosswalk, a gentle current parting taxis and chatter. One hands you a warm paper cup; another lifts two fingers to the traffic, and cars pause as if remembering their manners. The tallest points out a narrow passage you never noticed—a seam between a bakery and a locksmith—and you slip into its quiet.

As you walk, they trade you small, practical comforts: a spare scarf, the right bus number, a phrase in the local tongue that means “excuse me” and also, somehow, “I’m trying.” A boy with chalk dust on his palms draws an arrow on the pavement that only you seem to notice. It glows just a little, like a thought you don’t want to lose.

“Where are you going?” the oldest asks, not unkindly.

You open your mouth to offer an address and instead say, “Somewhere I can breathe.”

They nod, as if this is a real place on a real map.

Up an iron stair, across a quiet courtyard where laundry swings like flags of truce, onto a rooftop garden you could swear wasn’t here yesterday. The city spreads below, messy and magnificent. Wind moves through the planters, and leaves make the sound of gentle applause.

The courier kneels and draws a rough map on a damp cardboard box: not streets, but moments—“the bookstore with the green door,” “the bridge that hums,” “the bench that forgives.” The map is small enough to fit in your pocket and large enough to hold you.

“Here’s the way,” the tallest says, and for a second you think she means the stairwell. But she’s pointing at your chest, where the cup’s heat has settled. “You’ll recognize it when you feel it.”

You look back down to the streets. The chalk arrow has multiplied—thin, shy lines threading through the city, not demanding, just offering. The strangers begin to drift toward the exit, each with a small wave, the kind you return to people you somehow already know.

“Wait,” you say. “Will I see you again?”

“We’re everywhere,” the boy says, and grins. “We’re everyone.”

You take the first step alone. The arrow brightens, then another, then another. The city exhales. You follow the line that feels like air and find yourself moving, not toward a place, but into a steadier version of yourself. The streets are still busy. You are still small. But you are not lost anymore.
