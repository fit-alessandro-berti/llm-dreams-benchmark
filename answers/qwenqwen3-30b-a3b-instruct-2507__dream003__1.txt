...intricate patterns etched into the metal — spirals that seem to shift when you blink, constellations that rearrange themselves into unfamiliar stars. The box hums faintly, a low thrum beneath your fingertips, like a heartbeat from another world.  

As you run your fingers along the seam, something unexpected happens: the patterns begin to *pull*. Not outward, but inward — like the metal is breathing, folding a tiny fraction toward the center. And then, a whisper, not in your ears but in your bones:  

*"You were meant to open this at the third moon after you forgot your name."*  

Your breath catches. You *can't* remember your name. The dream feels familiar, like a place you’ve returned to before, though you’ve never been here.  

Suddenly, the box splits — not with a crack, but with a sigh — and inside, nestled in velvet as dark as the space between stars, lies a single, glowing key. It pulses with a warmth that feels like a memory.  

But as you reach for it, the key *sings*. A melody you’ve known since before you could speak.  

And from the walls of the dream-world around you, shadows begin to move — not toward you, but *away* from the box, retreating like a tide receding before a storm.  

The dream isn’t just showing you a mystery.  

It’s warning you.  

And you know, deep inside, that if you take the key… something ancient will wake.  

But you also know, with a certainty that chills and comforts you at once:  

You’re not the first to dream this.  
And you won’t be the last.  

Now — what do you do?
