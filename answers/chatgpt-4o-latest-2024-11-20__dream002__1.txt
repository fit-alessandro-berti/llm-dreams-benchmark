the wind begins to howl through the trees, their branches creaking and waving like warning fingers. The air grows dense, charged with electricity, and the once-bright green leaves shimmer with an almost ethereal glow. You stop in your tracks as the first raindrops land on your skin—cold, heavier than any rain you've felt before. But instead of water, the drops glisten like tiny droplets of liquid light, illuminating the ground where they land.

Suddenly, the forest itself seems to shift, the trees bending and reshaping as if alive, their trunks twisting unnaturally. Ahead of you, the path you were following vanishes, replaced by a glowing archway made of interwoven vines and pulsating with a soft golden light. It throbs in time with your heartbeat, almost as if it’s alive and waiting for you. The storm swirls aggressively around it, yet the archway feels like calm in the chaos, beckoning you forward.

Tentatively, you approach the glowing structure, each step amplifying the static in the air, until finally, you stand before it. As you peer through, the storm behind you seems to vanish, leaving only an eerie silence. Beyond the archway lies a landscape unlike anything you’ve ever seen—a boundless plain of floating islands, each suspended delicately in the air, connected by bridges of light. Above them hangs not a sun but a swirling galaxy, its colors spilling across the horizon like streaks of spilled paint.

Before you can decide whether to step through, a deep, resonant voice calls your name, not with sound, but directly into your mind. You whirl around, expecting to see someone behind you, but there’s no one there. Instead, the archway flickers for a moment, and a shadowy figure steps through from the other side, its form blurred and shifting like smoke in the wind. It extends a hand toward you, and though you can’t see its face, you feel as though you’ve known this figure your entire life.

The voice speaks again, "You’ve been here before, though you may not remember. This place... it’s waiting for you."
