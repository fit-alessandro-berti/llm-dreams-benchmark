You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. The air smells of woodsmoke and something else, unfamiliar, maybe animal or damp earth. The ground beneath you is uneven cobblestone. Sounds are different – the distant clatter of hooves, muffled voices speaking a language that feels both foreign and strangely resonant. Your clothes are rough, ill-fitting fabric. As you explore your new surroundings, the buildings are stone and timber, lit by flickering oil lamps or moonlight. Faces peer from doorways, curious or wary. You reach for your phone, your wallet – nothing. A wave of cold panic washes over you, quickly replaced by a sharp clarity. You realize you need to **find food, water, and shelter before night falls, and figure out who – or *what* – you are in this impossible, ancient place.**
