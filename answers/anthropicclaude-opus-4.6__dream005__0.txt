# The Gathering

You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and...

...each group seems to shift just as you approach, like schools of fish parting around a stone. The room is impossibly large — you could swear it was a ballroom when you entered, but now it stretches outward like a cathedral, the ceiling climbing until it dissolves into a hazy amber glow that might be chandeliers or might be stars.

You pass a circle of people laughing. One of them turns to you, and their face is almost familiar — like a composite of everyone you went to high school with. "We were just talking about you," they say warmly, but when you ask what they mean, their words come out as music. Cello music. Deep and resonant, vibrating in your chest.

You keep moving.

A group near the windows is speaking a language you don't know, except every fourth word is your name. They don't seem to notice they're saying it.

The floor changes from marble to grass to warm sand beneath your shoes, and you realize you are no longer wearing shoes. This doesn't bother you.

Then — there — across what is now an open courtyard under a violet sky, you see **them**. Your person. The one you know. They're standing alone, facing away from you, and the relief is so enormous it has a physical weight.

You call out.

They begin to turn.

And this is the part of the dream where time thickens like honey. Their turn takes an eternity. The ambient noise of the gathering drops to a low hum. You notice your heartbeat. You notice the space between one second and the next is a room you could furnish and live in.

Their face comes into view and — 

It's yours.

They smile at you with an expression of such deep knowing, such gentle amusement, that you feel tears prick your eyes without understanding why.

"You always take the long way," they say.

And you realize the gathering isn't a gathering at all. It's every version of yourself you've ever been, milling about in one impossible room, and the only person you were looking for — the only one you ever *knew* — 

was the one you keep forgetting to recognize.

You wake with the strange, fading warmth of having been, for one brief moment, completely found.
