you drift from cluster to cluster like you’re walking through different radio stations.

To your left: a semicircle of people debating the exact color of the sky. Not metaphorically—seriously. One insists it’s “commercial-laundry blue.” Another argues for “forgotten swimming pool.” A third quietly writes hex codes on a napkin and passes them around as if these will settle it. They all turn to you at once.

“What color is it?” they ask.

You look up. The ceiling of the room is open, but where the sky should be there’s only a vast, softly glowing menu labeled SELECT VERSION. It scrolls too fast to read. You say, “It’s loading,” and somehow that satisfies them; they nod gravely and return to their drinks.

You move on.

To your right: a group clustered around a table covered in keys. House keys, car keys, ornate skeleton keys, tiny brass diary locks, keys cut into impossible fractal shapes. People are picking them up, trying doors that occasionally appear where walls shouldn’t be. When a door opens, it shows a different memory: a childhood bedroom, a train station, someone else’s wedding.

“None of these are mine,” you tell the woman nearest you.

“Oh, of course not,” she says. “Yours are still in your other life.”

She tries one more key in a crack in the air; it opens onto a quiet morning you almost recognize. You lean closer, thinking you see your one friend there, sitting at a kitchen table, but when you blink, the door snaps shut and becomes just wallpaper again.

You keep moving.

Next group: people standing in a ring around an empty chair, enthusiastically discussing someone who hasn’t arrived.

“He’s so different now,” one says.

“No, he’s exactly the same,” another counters.

“I heard he remembers everything,” whispers a third.

You realize, with slow blooming discomfort, that they’re talking about you. One of them notices you hovering at the edge.

“Hey,” she says brightly. “We’re saving this seat for you.”

All of them turn. The empty chair turns too, scraping softly to face you. There is a name tag on its back with your handwriting. You go to sit, but halfway down the chair is suddenly already occupied by another you, smiling politely, making a better joke than you could. They don’t see you; they’re too busy listening to him.

You back away. Nobody notices you’ve left.

You wander into the next room without quite deciding to. The transitions are murky here; walls sag and stretch like curtains in a slow breeze. This new space hums with warm lamplight. In the middle, people are building a model of the house you grew up in, using sugar cubes, paperback books, mismatched mugs, and old phones.

“That window is wrong,” you say. You don’t mean to say it, but they hear you.

They look up, delighted. “Then fix it.”

They hand you a sugar cube. It’s unexpectedly heavy, like a stone pulled from deep water. You slot it into the model, correcting the window. The moment it’s in place, the real memory changes in your head to match the version they’ve built. You feel the shift—your stomach tilts, as if the floor moved one inch upward.

“That’s better,” someone says. “More accurate.”

You try to picture the original window, and it’s already gone.

You excuse yourself.

Now you’re in a hallway that doesn’t exist in the original house or the venue. It just goes. The carpet is thick with indistinct patterns that reorganize when you stop staring. At intervals, different conversations are happening in alcoves.

- One group passes around sealed envelopes. Each one bears a date from your future. When a person opens theirs, they instantly forget what was inside but look either relieved or quietly ruined.
- Another group is rehearsing introductions (“Hi, I’m the version of you that never left,” “Hi, I’m the version that called them back,” “Hi, I’m the version that meant to”) in front of a mute mirror.
- A scattered few are swapping faces like masks, trying on expressions to see which one fits their stories best.

You still haven’t found your friend.

You call their name. Only the walls answer, softly, syllables repeated and stretched like someone testing out a word in a new language.

You step through a doorway hoping, this time, it leads to something as simple as a kitchen. It does—but it’s absurdly long, like a train car, with the same countertop cloned dozens of times. People line both sides, chopping the same vegetables, laughing at the same joke on a loop. As you walk past, you see the repetitions: same carrot curl, same knife stutter, same laughter.

Halfway down, someone breaks the pattern. They’re your friend, leaning against the counter, not chopping, not laughing. Just waiting.

“There you are,” they say, like it’s the most natural thing in the world.

Relief floods your chest. The kitchen clonings dim to background static. You move toward them.

Every step forward, they’re one step farther away—just enough that you never quite get close.

“Stop,” you say.

They do. You don’t. Somehow you slide right past them, like your momentum belongs to someone else. The room folds, and you’re back at the start of the kitchen again.

This time, there is no friend. Just copies and copies and copies.

You try another door.

You stumble into a garden strung with lights that glow like bottled moonlight. Music curls through the trees, familiar but just beyond recall. People dance in slow, elaborate patterns, partnering and unpartnering. Everyone here is wearing a name tag that reads: I KNEW YOU ONCE.

As you walk through them, each person looks at you with the exact same expression: a flash of recognition, followed by polite uncertainty, followed by a small, apologetic smile. You look down at your own chest. Your name tag is blank.

“Have you seen—” you start.

“We’ve seen many things,” someone replies kindly. “Be more specific.”

You say your friend’s name. The moment you say it, their faces brighten with understanding—and then, all at once, each of them lifts a hand and points in a different direction.

You laugh, a small frayed sound. “That’s not helpful.”

“You’re asking the wrong question,” says a voice by your shoulder.

You turn. It’s the person who was writing sky-colors earlier, except now their clipboard contains rows of your almost-decisions, your almost-lives.

“What’s the right question?” you ask.

They tap the page. “Who is looking for whom?”

The lights in the garden flicker. For a second, all these strangers with I KNEW YOU ONCE on their chests are gone. You’re alone in an empty yard that you remember and don’t.

In the quiet, you finally see your friend sitting on the back steps that have always been there, waiting. They look exactly like you remember and also nothing like the last time.

“I’ve been trying to find you,” you say, and your voice comes out hoarse.

They tilt their head, a little sad, a little amused. “I’ve been everywhere you put me.”

You go to sit beside them. This time, there’s no rubber-band physics, no sliding away. The air smells like the beginning of rain.

“I don’t know anybody here,” you admit.

“Sure you do,” they say. “They’re all versions of you. You just keep pretending they’re strangers so you don’t have to say hello.”

You watch the lights above the garden pulse—soft, slow, like breathing. Far away, the party murmurs on: debates about the sky, keys for wrong doors, empty chairs filled by other yous. You realize you could go back to any of those rooms if you wanted.

Your friend nudges your shoulder. “You can wake up now, if you like.”

You hesitate. “If I wake up, will you be here?”

They consider this seriously, as if it’s a real contract. “If you look,” they say. “If you keep a seat for me that’s actually empty.”

The rain finally starts, but the drops hang midair like beads on invisible strings.

You stand. The world blurs at the edges.

“Okay,” you say. “I’ll look.”

You turn toward the place where the door should be, and as you step through—

—you are standing alone in your room, heart ticking fast, the echo of a party fading, one name vivid on your tongue, and for the first time in a long time, you feel like there’s someone you should call.
