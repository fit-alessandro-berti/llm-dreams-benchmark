Suddenly, the colors swirl into a kaleidoscope of ever-changing images, revealing scenes from memories and dreams. As you continue to paint with a brush that seems alive, the landscape around you responds—mountains ripple like waves, skies ripple with colors unseen in waking life. In this surreal world, you realize that your imagination is the only limit, and every brushstroke creates a new, wondrous realm.
