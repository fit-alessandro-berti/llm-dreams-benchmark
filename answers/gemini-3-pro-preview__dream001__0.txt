...panic. You reach into your pocket for your phone to check the address, but when you pull it out, it’s not a phone anymore—it’s a half-melted bar of chocolate. As you try to type on it, your fingers sink into the goo, and the numbers dissolve into brown swirls.

You look up, desperate for a street sign. The skyscrapers around you are bending inward like tall blades of grass, and the sky has turned a vibrating shade of violet. You spot a subway station entrance that looks exactly like your grandmother’s front door. "That must be the way," you think with absolute, dream-logic certainty.

You try to run toward it, but the air has turned into clear syrup. Your legs feel incredibly heavy, dragging through an invisible tide. You push forward, slow motion, panting, until you finally burst through the door.

Suddenly, you aren't in a subway station. You are in a long, carpeted hallway that stretches on forever. The walls are lined with clocks, but none of them have hands; they just have eyes that blink at you as you pass.

You sprint down the hall, knowing you are late. You find a door marked **"THE MEETING"** in neon handwriting. You throw it open, breathless.

Inside, twenty people in suits turn to look at you. But they aren't people; they are giant, upright pigeons. The one at the head of the table coos aggressively and points a wing at the empty chair. You look down at yourself and realize with horror that you are wearing your pajamas, and you are holding a tuba instead of your briefcase.

You raise the tuba to your lips to apologize, but no sound comes out—only a cloud of bubbles. The pigeons begin to slow-clap as the floor beneath you turns into water, and you wake up.
