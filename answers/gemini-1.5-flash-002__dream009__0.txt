You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around.  The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth.  Roughspun linen sheets cling to your skin, and the room is dimly lit by a single flickering candle.  There are no windows, only a heavy, wooden door.  As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to *find food and shelter*.

The simple realization hits you with the force of a physical blow.  Your clothes, a simple, homespun tunic and trousers, offer little protection against the chill that seeps from the stone walls.  Your stomach rumbles, a hollow ache reminding you of your desperate need for sustenance.  You cautiously open the door, revealing a small village nestled in a valley, the air thick with the sounds of livestock and the murmur of unfamiliar tongues.  The houses, built of wattle and daub, are clustered together for warmth and protection.  People, dressed in roughspun clothes similar to yours, go about their daily tasks - women tending to spinning wheels, men sharpening tools, children playing in the dust.

You hesitate, unsure of how to approach them.  Their language is completely alien, but you try a hesitant smile, hoping it’s a universal gesture of peace.  A woman, her face lined with the wisdom of years spent battling the elements, sees you.  She beckons you towards her, her expression unreadable, but her hand outstretched in a gesture that might be an invitation.  Fear warps in your chest, but the gnawing hunger and the need for shelter outweighs it.  You take a deep breath and step towards her, hoping this new, strange world won’t swallow you whole.  The smell of baking bread drifts from a nearby cottage, a beacon of hope in this unfamiliar, yet strangely captivating, landscape.
