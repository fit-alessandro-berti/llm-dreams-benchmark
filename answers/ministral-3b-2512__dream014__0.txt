**Dream Continuation:**

The moment the strangers step forward, the city around you seems to *pause*—the honking cars, the chatter of strangers, even the distant hum of traffic, all soften into a quiet, almost reverent silence. Their faces are warm, their voices gentle, but there’s something in their eyes that makes you feel seen for the first time in days.

One of them—a woman with silver-streaked hair tied back in a loose braid—holds out a hand. *"We’ve been looking for you,"* she says, her voice like wind through leaves. *"You’re not lost. You’re exactly where you’re meant to be."*

Before you can ask how, they lead you through a labyrinth of alleys that weren’t there before. The streets twist in ways that feel *intuitive*, like the city itself is guiding you. The air smells different here—fresh, like rain on pavement, or the scent of blooming jasmine in a courtyard you hadn’t noticed before.

As you follow them, you realize the strangers aren’t just helping you—they’re *showing you*. One points to a flickering neon sign that reads *"The Hollow Hour"* in an old, unfamiliar script. Another nudges you toward a door in a crumbling bookstore, its shelves lined with volumes that hum with faint, musical voices. A third leads you to a rooftop where the city’s lights stretch like a vast, shifting tapestry, and for the first time, you understand how small you are in the grand scheme of it all.

Then, the woman turns to you and smiles. *"You’re not alone,"* she repeats. *"But you’re also not just here. You’re *here* because you’re meant to be part of something bigger."* She gestures to the crowd around you—people you don’t recognize, but who seem to *know* you too. Some are laughing, others whispering, and a few are holding hands, their faces lit by the glow of lanterns.

A voice—deep, resonant—echoes from somewhere deep in the city: *"The lost are always found in the right time. And the right time is now."*

The strangers part, and you step forward, your feet no longer heavy with doubt. The city opens around you, not as a maze, but as a *door*. And for the first time, you realize: you’ve been waiting for this.

**What do you do next?** Do you follow the strangers deeper into the city, or do you pause to ask what they’ve revealed? Does the "Hollow Hour" hold a secret, or is there something else waiting beyond the rooftop?
