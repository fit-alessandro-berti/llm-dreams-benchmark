…written in a language you’ve never seen before—curling symbols that shift on the page as if alive. Every time you blink, the characters rearrange themselves, forming new patterns, new meanings.

Your classmates don’t seem bothered; they’re already writing furiously. You look down again and suddenly the exam booklet whispers, *“Begin.”*

Your pencil lifts on its own and traces a line across the first page. The symbols glow, rise off the paper like fireflies, and drift upward until they swirl around your head. One breaks away from the cluster, hovers in front of you, and unfolds into a tiny door—just big enough for your hand.

A voice from somewhere behind that door murmurs,
**“The only correct answer is the one you’re afraid to give.”**

The room fades. Your desk dissolves into warm mist. When you step through the tiny door, you find yourself standing in a version of your future career—an office, a studio, a laboratory, shifting between possibilities like reflections on water.

Each version of *you* in these shifting futures turns toward you at once.

One smiles and asks,
**“Well? What will you choose?”**

And the exam waits.
