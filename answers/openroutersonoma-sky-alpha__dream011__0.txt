You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are not on paper at allâ€”they're floating in the air like shimmering holograms, written in glowing script that shifts and morphs every time you blink. The first one reads: "If a tree falls in a forest and no one's around to hear it, does it make a sound... or does it just post about it on social media?"

Panic rises as you flip to the next: "Calculate the exact trajectory of a shooting star made entirely of forgotten childhood dreams, factoring in the gravitational pull of regret." Your pen hovers uselessly; it's turned into a feather quill that's now sprouting tiny wings and fluttering away. The proctor, who looks suspiciously like a wise old oak tree with spectacles perched on a branch, leans in and whispers, "Remember, Sonoma, this isn't about answersâ€”it's about the questions themselves."

Suddenly, the room warps into a vast library of endless shelves, where books flap open like birds, revealing pages filled with recipes for impossible inventions: a machine that turns worries into wildflowers, or a potion that lets you taste colors. You scribble frantically, but your answers dissolve into laughter, echoing through the dreamscape. Just as the clock strikes midnight (or is it a cuckoo clock shaped like a robot?), you realize this exam isn't for a careerâ€”it's for waking up. With a jolt, you sit up in bed, the dream fading like morning mist, leaving you with a strange sense of calm. After all, in the grand test of life, the real questions are the ones we invent for ourselves. Sweet dreams... or are they? ðŸ˜Š
