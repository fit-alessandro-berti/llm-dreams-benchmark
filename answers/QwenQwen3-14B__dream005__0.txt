You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and…  

The first group is a circle of strangers laughing hysterically, their voices overlapping in a cacophony of giggles. You try to join, but your words dissolve into static, as if the air itself is mocking your attempts to connect. Nearby, a second group sits in silence, their faces illuminated by the cold glow of smartphones, scrolling through content that seems to drain the color from the room. You pause, feeling the weight of their isolation, and suddenly the floor beneath you shifts—tiles rearranging into a labyrinth of mirrored corridors.  

In one corridor, you stumble upon a group debating the meaning of time. A woman in a clockmaker’s coat argues with a man wearing a hourglass as a pendant. “Time is a construct,” he insists, while she counters, “It’s the only thing that *is*.” You’re about to ask for directions when the walls ripple, and the corridor becomes a forest. Here, a third group gathers around a bonfire, roasting marshmallows that burst into smoke and whispers. They invite you to sit, but when you open your mouth, your voice is replaced by the sound of a distant train whistle.  

You press on, weaving through clusters of dancers in a ballroom that defies gravity, a choir singing in a language you once knew, and a table of chefs plating dishes that morph into abstract shapes. Each encounter leaves you more disoriented, until you notice a pattern: every group is missing someone. A child in the forest, a violinist in the ballroom, a shadow in the choir.  

Then, in a sunlit atrium, you spot them—the person you’ve been searching for. They’re standing alone, holding a key that glows faintly. But as you approach, they turn and smile, revealing they’ve been wearing a mask the whole time. “You were looking for *me*,” they say, “but you’ve already found *yourself* in the groups.” The key fits into a lock in your chest, and the dream dissolves into a field of dandelions, each puff a fragment of the gathering’s voices, now soft and familiar.  

You wake up, still holding the key, and realize the person you sought was never someone else—but the part of you that dared to wander the maze.
