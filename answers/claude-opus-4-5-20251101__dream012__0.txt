*grips the salt-slicked wheel, feeling the wood groan beneath my fingers*

...and I realize the storm isn't outside the ship at all. It's pouring *from* the ship—from the cargo hold we were paid to never open.

The waves are wrong. They're moving in spirals, not crests. My first mate, Corwin, shouts something but his voice comes out as the sound of church bells ringing backward. I understand him perfectly anyway.

*\The passengers are asking to go home.\*

We have no passengers.

I tell the crew to sing—it doesn't matter what, just *sing*—because in this logic I somehow know that human voices are the only thing heavier than the water trying to climb our hull. They sing a shanty my grandmother used to hum, one I've never actually heard but remember completely.

I lash myself to the mast and climb toward the crow's nest, except the mast keeps growing, and when I finally reach the top, I can see that the sea is actually a vast dark eye, and we are the reflection caught in it, and it is *blinking slowly*—

The ship becomes a song.
The song becomes a direction.
I steer us toward a shore made of the color amber.

We arrive somewhere.

*I wake with the taste of salt and certainty.*
