the wind begins to whip around you, bending the tops of trees and sending leaves swirling like dancers in a frantic waltz. The once-quiet forest becomes alive with sound—branches creaking, distant thunder rolling ever closer, and the sharp hiss of rain starting to fall through the canopy.

You wrap your arms around yourself and look for shelter, your steps quickening as the downpour begins in earnest. Just as the rain starts to blur your vision, you notice a faint glow through the trees. You push toward it, branches slapping at your arms, your shoes slipping on the wet earth.

Through the sheets of rain, a small, ancient-looking cottage materializes at the base of a mossy hill, its windows glowing with warm orange light. Smoke curls from a crooked chimney, and strange, melodious music floats on the breeze. You hesitate at the door, your hand outstretched, when it creaks open on its own.

Inside, the space is cozy and filled with the scent of herbs and woodsmoke. An old woman sits by the hearth, stirring something in a cauldron. She looks up with eyes that shimmer like moonlight on water and says your name—though you never gave it to her.

“You’ve returned,” she says with a knowing smile. “Exactly when you were meant to.”

Somehow, you understand this isn't just a dream—it’s *your* dream. One you've had before… or perhaps are about to have again.

Do you step inside? Or turn back into the rain?
