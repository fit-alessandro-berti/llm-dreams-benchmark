the air grows heavy with anticipation. The once-gentle rustling of leaves turns into an ominous whisper, as if the forest itself is warning you of what’s to come. Dark clouds roll in, swallowing the sunlight and casting long shadows that stretch like ghostly fingers across your path.

A sudden gust of wind sends a cascade of dry leaves spiraling around you, and for a moment, it feels as though time has paused. Then, without warning, lightning splits the sky—a brilliant white-hot crack that illuminates every detail of the forest: twisted tree roots gripping the earth, moss clinging stubbornly to bark, and distant shapes moving just beyond the edge of visibility.

The rain begins—not a soft drizzle but a torrential downpour, each drop cold and unyielding against your skin. You instinctively seek shelter beneath the thick canopy of trees, but even their ancient branches can’t fully protect you from the deluge. Water drips steadily from above, creating rhythmic patters on the forest floor.

As you stand there, soaked and shivering, something stirs deeper within the woods. It's not the sound of animals fleeing or the howl of the wind—it's something else entirely. A low hum, almost imperceptible at first, rises gradually until it fills the air around you. The forest seems alive with it, resonating with a strange energy that makes your hair stand on end.

You turn toward the source of the noise, curiosity overpowering fear. Through the curtain of rain, you see a faint glow emanating from between the trees ahead. As you step closer, the light intensifies, revealing a clearing bathed in an otherworldly luminescence. At its center stands a massive stone archway, covered in intricate carvings that pulse softly with the same mysterious energy.

Without hesitation, you approach the archway, drawn by an inexplicable pull. When you reach out to touch it, the world around you dissolves into swirling colors and sounds, leaving you suspended in a void where time and space seem meaningless. And then... 

What happens next?
