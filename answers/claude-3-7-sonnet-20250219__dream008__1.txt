You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel your heart racing as panic sets in. The stack of papers on your desk seems to grow taller by the second, defying physics.

You try to speak, to explain that the timeline is unreasonable, but your voice comes out as a whisper. Your boss doesn't seem to notice your distress and simply walks away, expecting results by tomorrow morning.

As you begin working, you notice the office transforming around you. The walls stretch farther away, the ceiling rises impossibly high, and your desk begins to float slightly off the ground. Your computer keyboard melts like Salvador Dal√≠'s clocks whenever you try to type.

Colleagues walk by, but their faces are blurred, and they speak in reversed sentences that somehow you still understand. "Deadline the meet will you know we." They nod encouragingly.

You look at your watch, but the hands spin wildly in both directions. When you glance up, it's suddenly night outside, then day again, then night, the sun and moon racing across the sky.

In desperation, you open your project folder, but instead of documents, hundreds of butterflies flutter out, carrying tiny fragments of your work on their wings. You chase them around the office, trying to piece together your presentation.

Just as you finally gather enough butterflies to make progress, the office intercom announces that the deadline has been moved up. "The client will be here in five minutes," it says, though the voice sounds suspiciously like your childhood pet.

You turn to your computer, determined to finish somehow, and find that your fingers have become incredibly efficient, typing faster than humanly possible. The work is flowing now, ideas connecting effortlessly, and you realize you might actually finish in time...
