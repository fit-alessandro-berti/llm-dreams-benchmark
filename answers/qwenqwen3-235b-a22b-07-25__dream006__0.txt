...speak—but no words come out. Your mouth moves, forming sentences you can’t hear, and the microphone emits only a low, pulsing hum that echoes through the vast hall. The faces in the audience blur slightly, their expectant expressions shifting, melting into soft edges like watercolors in the rain.  

Then, the floor beneath you softens. Not physically—you’re still standing firmly—but it *feels* like walking on warm sand, each step sinking slightly, as if the stage were breathing. The audience begins to rise, not standing, but *floating* slowly upward, chairs and all, drifting toward the domed ceiling like balloons released at a celebration.  

A single violin note rings out—clear, high, impossibly beautiful—and with it, the walls dissolve into a starlit sky. You’re no longer in a hall, but on a platform suspended in space, galaxies swirling gently around you. The silence is full now, not empty. And suddenly, you realize: you’re not supposed to speak.  

You were meant to *sing*.  

So you open your mouth, and a note emerges—not from your voice, but from the universe itself. It harmonizes with the violin, and one by one, the floating audience begins to hum, their voices weaving into a constellation of sound. Stars pulse in rhythm. Nebulas bloom with every breath.  

And you understand: this was never a speech.  
It was a lullaby for the cosmos.  

You keep singing.
