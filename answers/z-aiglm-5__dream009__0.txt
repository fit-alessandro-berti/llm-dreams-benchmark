find a way to hide the strange, synthetic clothes clinging to my body before the town guards take notice.

I look down at my neon running shoes and breathable polyester jacket—items that scream "outsider" in a world of homespun wool, muddy leather clogs, and coarse linen. The cobblestones beneath my feet are slick with morning dew and the remnants of a horse's passing. The air is thick, tasting of woodsmoke, roasting pig, and the unmistakable, pungent scent of unwashed bodies.

Panic flutters in my chest, but the dream logic keeps me moving. I cannot check the time; there is no glowing screen on my wrist, only the pale sun climbing over thatched rooftops. A rickety wooden cart rattles past, driven by a man shouting about fresh turnips. He eyes me with suspicion, his gaze lingering on the zipper on my jacket—a metal teeth anomaly in a world of ties and buttons.

I quickly duck into a narrow alleyway between a blacksmith’s forge and a baker’s shop, the heat from the ovens radiating against my back. I need to blend in. I need currency. I need to understand the language before I open my mouth and utter 21st-century slang that might get me accused of witchcraft.

Spotting a pile of discarded, threadbare rags near a back door, I realize my first task is a disguise. I strip off my modern layers, burying them under a pile of straw, and pull the rough, itchy tunic over my head. It smells of old ale and hay, but as I step back out into the light, I finally look like I belong. Now, I just need to figure out where—and when—I am.
