you float through them like a half-lit ghost.  

The first group is clustered under a chandelier made of glass birds that flutter in a wind I can’t feel. Their faces are smudged charcoal sketches except for one woman whose teeth glow with bioluminescent pearls. When she smiles, the pearls spill out of her mouth as soft bubbles that pop into tiny hawks and sail upward. One lands between my collarbones, chirps “Third floor balcony,” and dissolves into frost.

I climb a staircase that re-arranges itself—oak steps become baby grand keys, then ripple into singing slats of cedar. Each note I step on changes the color of my jacket until, by the top landing, the fabric is velvet indigo threaded with tiny mirror-fish.

On the landing, a poker table hosts four old men wearing paper crowns made from yesterday’s newspapers. Their chips are actual potato chips, and every time someone bets, the salt crystals rearrange into stock-market ticker summaries that scroll across the felt. One man blinks at me with watery eyes that have city maps for irises; his pupil is the red dot that says you-are-here. I ask for my friend. He folds a chip into a swan that flies up my sleeve and tugs me toward a red velvet curtain I hadn’t noticed before.

Behind the curtain is a greenhouse the size of a ballroom, full of clocks that grow as tulips. Their hands spin petals; when the hour is right the flowerface opens and a scent of childhood birthday cake drifts out. People wander through arm-in-arm, whispering into the stamens. One tulip-clock opens right in front of me and sprays gold pollen shaped like passport stamps. Candied time dust sticks to my shoes, and every footstep leaves a miniature rewind: the floorboards briefly return to tree and leaf and seed, then harden again.

At the far end of the greenhouse there’s an iron gazebo draped in ivy that hums accordion chords. Inside it, my friend—now wearing my own face from middle school—waves an empty wineglass. They shatter it against the gazebo rail and the shards turn into fireflies that spell a word in mid-air: Rooftop. The broken rim keeps spinning, a luminous halo, until the fireflies drift upward, dragging it like a kite.

I follow through a utility door that whooshes like subway brakes and find a service ladder made of unfolded sheet music. The climb is effortless; the notes turn into strong rungs beneath my hands. At the top, night wind carries the far-off sound of every alarm clock I ever slammed silent. The rooftop is a lake of mirror-water reflecting an upside-down party identical to the one below. People on the ceiling-waters dance on their reflections’ heads; chandeliers drip upward.

My friend stands in the middle in their real skin now—neither of us quite sure which level of dream we began on—holding two paper lanterns that glow with neon memories. We don’t speak. Instead, we each inhale our lantern: mine tastes like the night bus home from high school, theirs like rain on a first suit and tie. We exhale a combined bubble the size of a thought. Inside it, every stranger I’d met is waving goodbye with the same relaxed hand, as if I’d never been a ghost among them.

The bubble swells, becomes translucent sky, and lifts us off the mirror-water. Below, the mansion—house, greenhouse, ballroom, staircase—folds itself into a pop-up card that flutters shut. The one person I knew and the one person I didn’t collide gently into one body, and for a moment I’m holding my own hand.

Then the pop-up card slips between dream-curtains, and I wake in the dark, thumb still squeezed against my opposite palm as if to keep the handshake from ending.
