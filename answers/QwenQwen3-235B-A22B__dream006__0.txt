You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak—only to realize the words on the teleprompter are swirling like ink in water, unreadable. Your throat tightens, but your mouth keeps moving, reciting lines you don’t remember writing. The audience leans in, their faces blurring into a sea of glowing smiles and camera flashes.  

Suddenly, the floor beneath you ripples like a mirror struck by a stone. You stumble, and the podium dissolves into birds that scatter into the rafters. The crowd laughs, but the sound morphs into a low, resonant hum. A child in the front row holds up a sign that reads *“We’re waiting”* in glowing letters. Your hands tremble, yet you feel a strange calm as you abandon the script. You speak directly to the child, your voice steady now, weaving a story about a forest where lost words grow on trees like fruit.  

The audience leans back, entranced. The birds return, perching on your shoulders, and the stage solidifies into a meadow. You wake just as the applause swells, the echo of it lingering in your ears like a promise.
