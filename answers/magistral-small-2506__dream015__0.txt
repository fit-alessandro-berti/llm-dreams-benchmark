You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **build a new society**.

With a small group of survivors, you carve out a safe haven in the ruins of an old city, fortifying walls from scrap metal and reinforcing doors with salvaged wood. You establish rules—**share resources, protect the weak, and never trust outsiders blindly**.

One day, a wounded stranger stumbles into your camp, clutching a strange device. Before you can turn them away, they gasp out the words: *"They’re still watching."* The device flickers to life, projecting a map of the wasteland—with your settlement marked in red.

Now, you must decide: **Do you trust the stranger and uncover the truth? Do you banish them and hope the danger passes? Or do you unleash your own plan—one that might bring hope or doom to the last remnants of humanity?**

*The choice is yours.*
