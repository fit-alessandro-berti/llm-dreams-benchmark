...frantically patting your pockets, hoping for a clue. Your fingers brush against the smooth, cold surface of your phone. Relief washes over you for a second—you can pull up the address, call a cab, map your route.

But the screen is dark. You press the power button. Nothing. It’s completely dead, and you have no charger, no cord.

A wave of panic rises in your chest, but you force it down. *Think.* You look around. The city is a whirlwind of impossible architecture—gleaming chrome spires that twist like ribbons, streets that seem to curve upward into the sky, and floating trams that hum silently overhead. The people flowing past you are dressed in sleek, monochrome clothing, their faces neutral, moving with a purpose you desperately wish you shared.

You spot an old-fashioned newsstand tucked between two shimmering megastructures, a relic of a bygone era. An elderly man with kind eyes and a flat cap sits behind the counter, reading a physical, yellowed newspaper. He seems out of place, solid and real in this world of illusions.

You rush over. "Excuse me! I'm lost, I need to get to—" You freeze. The name of the company, the exact address—it's on the tip of your tongue, but it's gone. You can't remember it. You only remember the feeling of its importance.

The man lowers his newspaper and smiles, not at all surprised. "Looking for the meeting, are you?"

"How did you know?"

"Everyone here is," he says calmly. He doesn't offer a map or a phone. Instead, he points a gnarled finger down the street. "Take the third turning on the left, where the light bends but doesn't break. Go through the door that isn't there until you need it. You'll know."

The instructions are nonsense, yet they feel perfectly logical. You thank him and start running. The third turning on the left is an alleyway that shimmers like a heat haze. As you approach, the solid wall at the end of it ripples and becomes a simple, oak-paneled door.

You grasp the brass handle, turn it, and step through.

Suddenly, the chaotic noise of the city vanishes. You are in a silent, carpeted hallway. A single door at the end bears a polished brass plaque. You still can't read the name, but you know, with absolute certainty, that this is the place.

You check your watch. You are exactly on time. You take a deep breath, smooth your jacket, and open the door.

The room inside is not a boardroom. It is a vast, quiet library. Sitting in a large leather armchair by a crackling fire is... you. An older, calmer version of yourself. He looks up from his book and smiles.

"Ah, there you are," he says. "I was wondering when you'd arrive. We have much to discuss."

And as you sit in the chair opposite him, you understand. The important meeting was never about a client or a job. It was a meeting with yourself.
