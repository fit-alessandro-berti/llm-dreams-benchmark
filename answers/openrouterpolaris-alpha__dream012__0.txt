…and you feel the whole sky lean closer, black and swollen with electrical veins, waiting to see what you’ll do.

You wipe the salt from your eyes and plant your boots wide on the slick deck. The ship shudders, not just from waves but like something enormous has exhaled beneath it. Your crew’s faces are ghost-lit by lightning; their fear hangs heavier than the rain.

“Hold fast!” you shout, though your voice sounds like it’s trying on someone else’s courage. “Reef the main, lash everything down! No one goes overboard tonight!”

They move because you said it, and because they want to believe you know how this ends.

The compass spins uselessly, the needle trembling as if it’s afraid to choose. The wheel bucks under your hands, fighting toward a direction that isn’t anywhere you’ve ever charted. When the next flash of lightning claws open the sky, you see it:

On the horizon, where there should be nothing but waves, stands a door.

Freestanding, tall as a mast, made of dark wood that doesn’t get wet though the rain hits it. It glows faintly along its edges, like a memory almost remembered. The storm seems to be circling it, like a pack of wolves afraid of fire.

Your first mate stares at it, lips pale. “Captain…?”

You don’t know what it is, but you know with the strange certainty dreams allow that if you ignore it, the ship will break apart. You also know that the charts in your cabin warned you of this, though you’re sure you’ve never seen those charts before.

You spin the wheel, angling the prow toward the impossible door. The ship groans, wanting to turn away, but you grit your teeth and force it. Spray knifes across your face, cold and stinging, but something warm burns in your chest.

The crew begins to protest—“That’s not a passage, that’s a wall” and “We’ll smash ourselves to pieces”—but then the sea itself rises behind you, a mountain of water coiling like a living thing. Thunder rolls so close it sounds like a growl.

“Trust me!” you call, though you’re not entirely sure who you’re asking: them, the sea, or yourself.

You drive the ship forward.

The door grows larger, no hinges, no handle, just a seam of light around its frame. The wave behind you builds, a towering shadow ready to crush you flat. For a heartbeat, everything slows: the spray hangs in the air, your crew holds its breath, the world narrows to the line of light ahead.

At the last moment, you realize that to pass through, you have to let go.

Not of the wheel—of control.

You shut your eyes.

You release your white-knuckled grip.

You decide, fiercely, not what happens, but that you will face it.

The wave slams into the stern as the bow touches the glowing seam—

—and instead of splintering, the ship slides through.

Sound cuts out. The storm, the shouting, the rage of the sea—all vanish like someone closed a fist around them.

You open your eyes.

You are sailing across a glass-smooth ocean under a sky filled with stars you have never seen before. Constellations move slowly, rearranging themselves into shapes: a key, an open eye, the outline of your own hand on a wheel.

Your terrified crew has gone quiet, their fear transmuted into awe. One of them laughs once, helplessly. Another kneels and touches the water; it shines around their fingers like liquid moonlight.

The impossible door stands behind you on the horizon, already drifting away, ajar now. Through its narrow opening you can still see the heaving black of the storm, as if it belongs to some other world that hasn’t realized you left.

Your first mate steps toward you. “Where are we, Captain?”

You look to the sky. One of the constellations bends slightly, forming an arrow pointing ahead into a softness of fog that glows with a faint, inviting gold.

You should say, “I don’t know.”

Instead, with a calm that surprises you, you say, “Exactly where we’re meant to be. Set a course for that light.”

As your crew moves to obey, you sense something: the ship beneath you isn’t only wood and sail now. It’s made of every choice you’ve ever almost made. The helm fits your hands like it was carved from your own spine. The air tastes like new beginnings.

The golden fog approaches. Within it, vague shapes: a shoreline that looks unnervingly like your childhood bedroom; the suggestion of a face you miss; a doorway that leads inward instead of in.

You glance back one last time. The storm door on the horizon closes with a soft, definite click.

You take a breath and guide your ship forward.

The light swallows you, and you wake up with salt on your lips and the steady feeling that, for once, you did not steer away.
