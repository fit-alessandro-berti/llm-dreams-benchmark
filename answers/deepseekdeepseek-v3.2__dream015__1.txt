...to follow the faint, persistent hum you've heard on the wind for days. It's not the rasp of sand, nor the groan of twisted metal. It's a clean, low-frequency thrum, like a memory of electricity.

The old maps are useless, scoured blank by dust storms, but the sound pulls you like a lodestone. You navigate by the skeletons of skyscrapers, their shadows stretching like sundials across the wastes. Your water is low, your boots are splitting, and the eyes of scavenger packs gleam from the ruins at dusk.

But the hum grows stronger.

It leads you to a sheer canyon wall, seemingly solid rock. But there, hidden behind a curtain of hardy, mutated ivy, is a seam—a perfect, vertical line. You press your hand against it, and with a sigh of hydraulics lost to time, a door slides open.

Inside, the air is cool and still. Soft, blue light emanates from panels in the walls. The hum is everywhere here, the sound of a heartbeat. Before you stretches a long corridor, and at its end, a door labeled in faded, pre-fall script: **TERRAFORMING SEED VAULT – PROTOCOL: ARCADIA.**

On a console beside the door, a single green light blinks patiently, as if it has been waiting for a very, very long time. For you.

You realize the greatest resource wasn't hidden in the ground. It was waiting, dormant, for someone to walk out of the wasteland and choose to begin again.
