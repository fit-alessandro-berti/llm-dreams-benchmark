...the puzzles become more intricate, their designs shifting subtly with each step you take. The walls seem to breathe, their surfaces etched with equations and riddles that dissolve into new challenges as soon as you solve them. A faint, pulsing light flickers ahead, drawing you forward—yet the deeper you go, the more you suspect the maze isn’t just testing your mind… but reshaping it.

Suddenly, you reach a chamber with a massive, ornate door covered in interlocking gears. A voice whispers in your ear—your own voice—but from a time you don’t remember. It says:

*"The final puzzle isn’t solved with logic. It’s solved when you realize you’ve been the key all along."*

The door begins to shudder, its gears grinding. What do you do?
