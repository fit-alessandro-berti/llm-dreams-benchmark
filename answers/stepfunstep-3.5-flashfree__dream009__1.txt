You wake up on a rough-spun wool blanket, the air cool and smelling of woodsmoke, damp earth, and something animal—maybe hay or livestock. Sunlight filters through a small, leaded glass window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The room is made of heavy, dark timbers and whitewashed plaster. No electric lights, no humming fridge, no distant traffic. Just the cluck of chickens and a far-off crow of a rooster.

You sit up, your head swimming. Your modern clothes feel absurdly out of place—soft, seamless, vibrantly colored. You realize you need to **figure out where—and *when*—you are, and how to survive.**

A door, made of thick, hand-hewn wood, stands slightly ajar. From the crack, you see a courtyard with a well, a woman in a long, simple dress tending a hearth, and a man in coarse trousers and a tunic sharpening a tool on a grindstone. Their clothes, their tools, the very architecture… it whispers of a past centuries before your own.

**What do you do?**

*   **Try to communicate.** You step out, your strange shoes silent on the packed earth. Your modern accent and vocabulary will be a barrier, but gestures are universal. You need to know the year, the village name, and if you’re a threat or a curiosity.
*   **Observe first.** You melt back into the shadows of the room, listening. What language do they speak? Are they welcoming or wary? What are the dominant sounds, smells, and sights? Knowledge is your first weapon.
*   **Search the room.** Your "bedroom" might hold clues. Is there a Bible with a printer's date? A coin in a drawer? A calendar? A letter? Anything with a date, a place name, or a historical reference could be your anchor.
*   **Check your own body.** Do you still have your wallet? Phone? The digital world is gone, but physical items remain. What’s in your pockets? Could a modern object be mistaken for witchcraft or a divine sign?

The dream holds its breath, waiting for your first move in this new-old world. **The path you choose will shape your story.**

***Whichever path you choose, remember: dreams are collaborative. Your next thought, your next feeling, will complete the scene.***
