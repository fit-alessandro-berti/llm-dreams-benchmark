As you walk through the cobblestone streets, you notice that everyone around you is dressed in garments from centuries past. Horse-drawn carts clatter by, and merchants shout from bustling market stalls. The scent of freshly baked bread and the melodies of street musicians fill the air.

Realizing you need food and shelter, you decide to find work. You approach a blacksmith's forge where the clang of metal resonates. The blacksmith notices your curiosity and, seeing potential in you, offers to teach you the trade. Though the tools are primitive compared to what you're used to, you embrace the challenge.

Days turn into weeks as you learn the craft. Your modern knowledge gives you unique insights, and you start creating tools and items that astonish the townsfolk. Word of your skill spreads, and people come from distant villages to see your creations.
