…feel your heart race as you stare at the towering stack of paperwork and blinking cursor on your computer screen. Everything feels oddly vivid—fluorescent lights buzzing louder than usual, the ticking clock above seeming to echo in your skull. Your boss smiles just a little too wide, like a wax figure come to life, nodding encouragingly.

You start typing, but the words rearrange themselves or vanish entirely. Files multiply every time you close one, and with each click, your to-do list doubles. When you look up again, your co-workers are mannequins—posed stiffly, frozen mid-conversation. The office windows show a sky of swirling violet and orange, where the sun rises, sets, and rises again in moments.

The walls begin to bend inward like soft clay, and your computer melts into a puddle of ink that crawls toward your shoes. You try to stand, but your chair binds you like it's grown tendrils. The screen flashes: **"Deadline reached."**

Suddenly, your boss leans down, his smile stretching impossibly wide, and says, “Time doesn't exist here unless you count it.”

Then your alarm goes off, and you wake up—only to find yourself back at your desk, the project still there… and the clock ticking backward.
