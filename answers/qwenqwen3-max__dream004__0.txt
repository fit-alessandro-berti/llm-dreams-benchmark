...and as you reach out to touch it, your fingertips don’t meet solid surface—they sink into the canvas like warm water. The moment your hand passes through, the blankness *breathes*.  

Suddenly, the canvas ripples, pulling you forward. You tumble into its depths—not falling, but *unfolding*. The world behind you dissolves into swirling nebulas of cerulean and gold, while the space ahead shimmers with impossible geometries: floating dodecahedrons dripping liquid silver, trees made of stained glass that chime like wind chimes, and rivers flowing upward into clouds shaped like forgotten memories.  

Then you notice *your hands*. They’re no longer flesh, but woven from threads of light—each finger a different hue, shifting as you move. You raise them, and the landscape *responds*. Where your crimson fingertip points, crimson vines spiral from the air. Where your sapphire thumb brushes the ground, crystalline pools bloom beneath your feet, reflecting constellations that don’t exist in any sky you’ve known.  

A voice echoes—not in your ears, but in the hollow between your ribs:  
***"You are the brush now."***  

You understand. This canvas isn’t empty. It’s *waiting*. And every shape you imagine, every color you *feel*, will rewrite the dream.  

So you close your eyes... and begin to paint with your pulse.  

*(The dream bends where you look next.)*
