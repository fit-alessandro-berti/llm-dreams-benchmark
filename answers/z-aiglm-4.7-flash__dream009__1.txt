...realize you need to **make a sound, because the absolute silence in the room is starting to melt the edges of your vision.**

Your mouth opens, and instead of a scream or a word, **a long, glistening ribbon of gold silk pours out of your throat**. It catches the dim light of the single candle flickering on the table, stretching across the dusty stone floor and weaving itself around the legs of an antique chair. The thread feels warm against your tongue, pulsing with a slow, rhythmic heartbeat. Driven by a fear of disappearing, you follow the thread with your eyes, and as you do, the chair legs slowly transform into the trunks of ancient, twisting trees, carrying you deeper into a forest you never knew existed.
