...realize that you've been sleepwalking through your morning routine and are still in your pajamas. Panic sets in as you quickly change into work clothes, trying to hide your disheveled appearance from your colleagues. Your heart races as you rush to your desk, only to find that your boss has already left a message on your computer: "The project is a go, and it needs to be completed by end of day today. Good luck!"

You can't help but laugh at your situation, knowing you've been dreaming. This impossible deadline was just a product of your subconscious trying to challenge you. With a sigh of relief, you decide to take a quick nap at your desk, knowing that when you wake up, you'll be able to face reality with a clear mind.
