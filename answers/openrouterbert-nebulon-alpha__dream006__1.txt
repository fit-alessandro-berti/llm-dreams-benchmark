The stage lights blur into a soft, golden haze as you take a deep breath, your fingers brushing against the edges of the notecards in your hand—only to realize they’ve dissolved into petals, drifting away like confetti. The audience murmurs, but their faces are shifting, melting into the shapes of people you’ve known at different points in your life: your childhood teacher, your first crush, a stranger from a train years ago, all watching you with the same quiet intensity.

You open your mouth to speak, but the words come out in a language you don’t recognize—yet somehow, the crowd understands. A ripple of nods spreads through the room, and the air hums with a strange, electric warmth. Then, the stage beneath you begins to tilt, the floorboards peeling back like the pages of an old book, revealing a vast, star-strewn sky below. You’re no longer standing; you’re floating, the audience now seated on clouds that drift lazily in the void.

A voice—your own, but not—echoes from somewhere unseen: *"Tell them about the door."*

You turn, and there it is: a plain wooden door, slightly ajar, standing alone in the middle of the stage. The crowd leans forward as one, their faces alight with curiosity. You reach for the knob, but your hand passes through it like mist. The door creaks open on its own, revealing not a room, but a memory: a sunlit kitchen, the scent of cinnamon, a younger version of yourself laughing at something you can’t quite hear.

The dream fractures. The audience is gone. You’re standing in that kitchen now, but the walls are made of glass, and beyond them, the crowd watches silently from the other side, their expressions unreadable. The younger you turns, holding out a key. *"You forgot this,"* they say.

You wake up—if you were ever asleep at all—with the weight of the key still in your palm, cool and real. The speech, the door, the crowd: all of it lingers like the aftertaste of a half-remembered song. And somewhere, just beyond the edge of your vision, the door is still open.

(Would you like to step through it?)
