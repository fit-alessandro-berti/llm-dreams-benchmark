In the dream, the exam paper in front of you is blank—no questions, no prompts. Just a vast, empty expanse of paper. Panic rises in your chest as you glance around. Every other student is writing furiously, their pencils scratching against the pages. You lean forward, squinting at your own sheet, willing words to appear.

Then, one by one, the questions materialize—but not in the way you expect. Instead of typical exam questions, they are personal, cryptic, and deeply unsettling:

1. *What is the one thing you are certain you cannot change about yourself?*
2. *Describe a moment you failed and why you still believe you are worthy.*
3. *If you had to relive one day of your life, which would it be, and why?*
4. *What is the lie you tell yourself most often?*
5. *How would you define happiness, and are you currently experiencing it?*

Your hands tremble as you read them. There’s no cheat sheet, no textbook to reference—only your own mind. The room feels suffocating. The proctor, a shadowy figure at the front, turns and locks eyes with you. Their voice echoes in your skull:

*"Answer honestly, or the exam is over."*

You take a deep breath and begin to write.
