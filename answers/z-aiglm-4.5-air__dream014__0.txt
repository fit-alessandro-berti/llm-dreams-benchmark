ift you off your feet—literally—for a moment, as a small, wiry woman with silver-streaked braids hugs you tightly. Her scent of cinnamon and baking bread replaces the city's sharp diesel and pavement smell. "Honey, you're freezing! And your eyes are all red." Her voice is warm, like melted honey.

Before you can stammer a response, the others close in:  
- A man with a kind, weathered face and paint-stained hands gently takes your elbow. He smells of linseed oil and rain. "Which way did you come from? Doesn't matter. Look at that map!" He points to a massive, glowing holographic billboard advertising hover-cars, not a paper map, but he pretends it's the most natural thing. "See that glittering spire? We'll get you there. Or wherever you need to go."  
- A teenager with electric-blue hair and a backpack covered in patches slides an insulated flask into your hand. "Here. Best hot chocolate this side of the Nebula Parks. Warms you up straight to your toes." He grins, showing one silver tooth.  
- A quiet woman observing from slightly behind, holding a small, glowing orb that pulses softly like a captured star. She offers a shy, understanding smile, her eyes reflecting the city's lights like dark pools.

Their presence is a sudden, warm beacon in the cold, anonymous throng. The tide of rushing bodies parts around them, the urgency replaced by a bubble of shared space and kindness. You blink back sudden tears, feeling a lump rise in your throat. "I... I don't know... I was just so turned around. Everything looks different."

"Everything *feels* different now," the blue-haired boy says wisely. He nudges his friend. "C'mon, Mercury – use your little light-show. We'll make her a path."

The woman with the orb (Mercury, apparently) nods. She touches the glowing sphere, and it expands, floating gently above her palm. It casts soft, warm light onto the wet pavement, illuminating swirling patterns like captured auroras. It doesn't blind, but guides, a gentle beacon leading *away* from the chaotic crowds and down a quieter, cobblestoned alley.

"Follow the light," the painter urges. "It'll take us where we need to go. Try not to step on the grumpy, asleep alley-cat, though."

They don't ask for your name or where you're staying. They don't question why you were lost. They simply walk beside you, the painter telling absurd stories about pigeons with a taste for expensive hats, the baker lady humming a tuneless melody that somehow settles your nerves, the teenager pointing out hidden murals on the brick walls, and Mercury walking quietly, her light steady and unwavering.

The light leads you not to a specific destination, but to the door of a charming little bakery – the source of the cinnamon scent. It's nestled between a vintage bookshop and a flower stall overflowing with impossible blue roses. The sign simply says: "The Crumb & The Star."

"A bit of stargazing with your coffee?" the baker woman asks with a wink. "Or maybe a warm pastry while you figure out your next step? On the house." She pushes open the door, releasing a wave of warm air, the smell of fresh bread, and the gentle chime of a bell.

As you step inside, the bell tinkles again, and you look back. The painter points towards a map painted on the wall. The teenagers are gesturing animatedly. Mercury is carefully tucking her glowing orb back into her pocket. They don't look back, just beckon you inside with warm smiles.

The door swings shut. Inside, the world shinks to the cozy warmth of the bakery. You're safe. You're not lost anymore. And as you wrap your hands around the hot chocolate the teenager poured for you, you realize the real destination wasn't a place, but this feeling – the profound warmth of unexpected kindness found in the heart of a sprawling, indifferent city. You smile, feeling a peculiar tingle in your palm, as if you can still feel the faint warmth of Mercury's glowing orb.
