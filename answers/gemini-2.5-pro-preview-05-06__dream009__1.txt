...**find out who I am *here*.**

The air is thick with the smell of woodsmoke and something else... damp earth and blooming wildflowers I can't name. My feet, surprisingly bare, press against cool, uneven cobblestones. Buildings lean into each other, their timber frames exposed, windows small and paned with what looks like oiled parchment rather than glass. People in rough-spun tunics and leather jerkins hurry past, some leading donkeys laden with goods, others carrying baskets. They glance at me, their expressions a mixture of curiosity and suspicion, but mostly they just... pass by. My modern clothes are gone, replaced by a simple, itchy linen shift that feels alien against my skin.

I have no memory of how I got here, no sense of my previous life in this new context. Am I a peasant? A lost noble? A vagrant? The language they speak is a flowing, melodic babble I don't comprehend. My pockets are empty. Hunger gnaws at my stomach, thirst parches my throat, but a more pressing, existential need eclipses even those basic urges.

As a child stares openly, pointing a grubby finger, and a gruff-looking man with a blacksmith's apron eyes me with narrowed scrutiny, I realize I need to **learn the language, understand the customs, and discover my place in this world before I attract the wrong kind of attention.** I need to find a friendly face, a morsel of information, anything to anchor myself in this disorienting reality. My survival, and perhaps even the key to understanding this dream, depends on it. The biggest immediate need, however, feels even more fundamental: I need to **find water that's safe to drink, and then, somehow, communicate that I mean no harm.**
