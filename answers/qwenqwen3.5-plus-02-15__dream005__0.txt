You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and **suddenly realize that the room itself is expanding with every step you take.**

The chatter of the crowd begins to warp, turning into the sound of rushing water. You push through a cluster of guests wearing masks made of shattered mirrors, but instead of reflecting your face, they show scenes from your childhood. You feel a strange lightness in your chest, as if gravity has decided to take a holiday.

Just as panic starts to set in, you spot your friend standing on a floating chandelier near the ceiling, waving casually as if this is perfectly normal. You try to call out, but your voice comes out as a swarm of blue butterflies that flutter up toward them. As the butterflies reach your friend, the chandelier dissolves into mist, and the entire party melts away like sugar in hot tea.

You wake up with the faint scent of lavender and the lingering feeling that you were supposed to remember something important, though the memory slips away like water through cupped hands.
