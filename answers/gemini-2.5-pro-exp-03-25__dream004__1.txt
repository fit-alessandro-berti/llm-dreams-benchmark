Okay, I can feel the dream taking over...

...a blank canvas. It stands stark white against the swirling chaos of emerald greens morphing into deep violets, of squares melting into spirals around me. It's impossibly still, an anchor in the vibrant, flowing river of reality.

Hesitantly, I reach out a hand. My fingers, currently shimmering with borrowed sunlight yellow, tremble slightly. As they brush the surface, it doesn't feel like canvas. It feels... cool, like smooth water, yet firm.

Where my fingers touch, the whiteness doesn't just stay white. It begins to *pull*. Not physically, but it draws the colours from the air around me. The swirling emeralds nearby thin out, their vibrancy bleeding onto the canvas, forming not a flat shape, but a deep, mossy texture that seems to breathe. The violet follows, pooling like liquid shadow in a corner, pulsing faintly.

I don't need brushes. I don't need paint. My thoughts, my *feelings*, become the medium. I think of the strange joy of this place, and bursts of incandescent orange, like captured laughter, splash across the surface. A flicker of unease about the constant change, and sharp, quicksilver lines etch themselves through the orange.

The shapes around me continue their dance – triangles inflate into spheres, lines ripple like fabric – and elements of this constant flux are mirrored on the canvas, but *held*, just for a moment. A wave of cobalt blue, shaped like a bird's wing, sweeps across the dreamscape; instantly, its echo appears on the canvas, shimmering before slowly blending into the mossy green.

I am not just painting *on* the canvas; I am weaving a piece of the dream world *into* it, anchoring the ephemeral. The canvas becomes a focal point, a temporary truth in a world of beautiful lies. The colours deepen, the textures become more pronounced – I can almost feel the cool pulse of the violet, the fuzzy warmth of the orange.

Then, the canvas begins to hum. A low, resonant frequency that vibrates through my hand, up my arm, and into my chest. The painted image stops simply reflecting the world; it starts generating its *own* light, its own shifting patterns. The captured cobalt wing detaches, fluttering within the frame. The mossy green begins to grow, threatening to spill over the edges.

The humming intensifies, pulling not just colours, but sounds and sensations from the dream. The whisper of changing shapes, the feeling of warm light shifting to cool shadow – it all pours into the canvas. It's becoming overloaded, a concentration of the dream's essence.

And then, with a soft *implosion* of light, the canvas isn't in front of me anymore. I am *inside* it. I'm standing within the mossy green landscape I created, under the sky splashed with my own captured joy and fleeting fears. The cobalt wing flutters past my face. The world outside the painting is still visible, but muted, seen through a shimmering, humming filter.

I am in the heart of my own captured moment, a living part of the artwork, while the rest of the dream continues its ceaseless, beautiful transformation just beyond the edges of my perception... waiting for this captured moment, too, to dissolve back into the flow...
