You are walking through a dense, ancient forest blanketed in soft moss and dappled sunlight filtering through a canopy of towering oaks and pines. The air is cool and fragrant with damp earth and pine needles. Birds sing softly from unseen perches.

The first sign is the temperature drop – a sudden, sharp chill that goes straight to your bones. It feels more like winter's bite than spring's breeze. The birdsong abruptly cuts off, replaced by an unnerving silence broken only by a low rumbling that doesn't quite sound like thunder – it feels deeper, more primal.

Then, the wind arrives. Not a gentle sigh, but a howl, full of force and urgency. It whips through the trees with a sound like a thousand frantic spirits racing ahead. Smaller branches snap with sharp cracks, echoing in the suddenly vast and raw space. The rain isn't rain anymore; it's a fine, driving sleet that stings your skin and cuts through the edges of your clothes, like icy needles.

You look up just as the first massive, pitch-black cloud sweeps over the clearing where you stand. Lightning erupts, not sporadically, but in jagged, blinding flashes that carve fractal patterns across the torn canopy. The thunder that follows is earth-shattering, a colossal PEAL that vibrates in your chest and shakes the very roots of the ancient trees around you. The forest feels charged, alive with terrifying energy, bending and groaning under the assault. Leaves are torn from branches, dancing like shredded confetti caught in the gale. Rain turns to torrential downpour, the water pounding the earth into muddy craters.

Panic starts to rise. You try to run, but the wind is a wall, pushing against you, making each step a monumental effort. Trees sway dangerously close to collapsing. Seeking shelter feels impossible; any corner you duck into could be sealed. The light fades rapidly, plunging everything into near-total darkness lit only by the periodic, terrifying flambé of lightning. The world is transformed into a terrifying, almost alien landscape of noise, fury, and utter chaos. You feel small and utterly vulnerable, the deep, ancient resonance of the forest now a symphony of destruction threatening to overwhelm you, before the dream ends and you wake, heart pounding.
