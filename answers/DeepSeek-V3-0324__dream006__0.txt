...feel a strange sensation—like the air around you is shimmering. The microphone in your hand feels lighter than it should, almost weightless. You open your mouth to speak, but instead of words, a soft, golden light spills from your lips, swirling in the air like liquid sunlight.  

The audience gasps, but not in fear—in awe. Their faces glow in the radiance, and you realize you’re not just speaking. You’re *singing*, though you’ve never heard this melody before. The notes form visible shapes in the air: spirals of stardust, constellations rearranging themselves to the rhythm of your voice.  

Then, one by one, the audience begins to rise—not from their seats, but *into the air*, lifted by the music. The ceiling of the auditorium dissolves into an endless sky, and suddenly, you’re all floating among the stars, carried by the dream of the speech you never had to give.  

And just as you wonder if this is real, you hear a whisper—maybe your own, maybe the universe’s:  

*"You’ve always known how to fly. You just forgot until now."*  

(Then you wake up, heart racing, with the faintest hum of that unknown song still echoing in your mind.)  

Would you like to explore what the dream might mean, or should we take it somewhere even wilder?
