You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, you notice the walls pulsing with a soft, ethereal glow, whispering riddles in voices that echo your own thoughts. The air grows thicker, scented with forgotten memories—rain on childhood windows, the tang of fresh ink on old books.

The first deep puzzle is a door etched with interlocking gears, each turning only when you align symbols from your past: a childhood fear represented by a shadowed owl, a lost love as a wilting rose. You solve it with a trembling hand, and the door swings open to reveal a chamber where gravity inverts. You walk on the ceiling, piecing together a fractal mosaic that shifts like liquid mercury, demanding you calculate infinite patterns in finite steps. Success drops you gently to the "floor," heart pounding.

Deeper still, the maze fractures into mirrors, each reflecting not your body, but alternate lives: the artist you never became, the explorer lost at sea, the king who fell. To proceed, you must shatter the correct one—not with force, but by reciting a paradox that makes the glass dissolve: "This sentence is false." Shards reform into a bridge over an abyss of swirling stars.

At the heart, the final puzzle awaits: a pedestal holding a luminous orb, guarded by your own shadow, which mimics every move. It demands not logic, but surrender—you must stop thinking, let intuition guide your hand to trace a spiral that matches the shadow's dance. The orb cracks open, flooding the maze with light.

You awaken, not in panic, but with a quiet smile, the maze's secrets etched in your mind like a map to hidden doors in waking life. The dream fades, but the puzzles linger, waiting for tomorrow's solve.
