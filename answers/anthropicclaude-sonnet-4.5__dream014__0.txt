# A Dream of Connection

...feel an unexpected warmth wash over you. Their faces are blurred yet somehow familiar, like people you've known in another life. One of them—a figure in a deep blue coat—takes your hand, and suddenly the chaotic city streets begin to transform.

The buildings start to bend and breathe, their windows becoming kaleidoscopes of colored light. The strangers lead you through a narrow alley that shouldn't exist, and you emerge into a hidden garden suspended impossibly between skyscrapers. 

Flowers bloom in fast-motion around your feet, and you realize the strangers are speaking to you, but not with words—with feelings that arrive fully formed in your mind. They're showing you that you were never actually lost. The city rearranges itself around you now, streets folding like origami, revealing that every path leads home.

One of them hands you a small, glowing object—it might be a compass, or a key, or a seed—you can't quite tell because it keeps shifting forms. But you know with dream-certainty that it's exactly what you needed to find.

As you look up to thank them, their faces finally come into focus: they're all reflections of yourself at different ages, smiling with understanding. The city dissolves into gentle light, and you wake with the echo of their kindness still warming your chest.
