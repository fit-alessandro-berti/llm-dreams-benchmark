# The Dream Continues...

...you need to **find water first**.

Your throat is parched in a way you've never experienced. The sun beats down on unfamiliar terrain—dusty earth, strange vegetation, distant mountains. Your phone is gone. The electricity hum that's always been in your ears is replaced by wind, bird calls, and your own breathing.

You wander until you find a stream, cupped your hands and drink deeply. The water tastes clean, almost too real for a dream.

That's when you notice the village—thatched roofs clustered in a valley below. Smoke curls from fires. You know you need to **understand what time this actually is**.

As you descend the hillside, a child spots you first. She points at your clothes—so strange here. An older woman emerges from a doorway, assessing you with intelligent eyes. She says something in a language that sounds almost familiar, though you can't quite grasp it.

You open your mouth to speak, and realize you need to **decide who you're going to pretend to be**—because clearly, you don't belong, and the truth would sound like madness.
