speak, but no sound comes out. You clear your throat and try again—still nothing. The crowd murmurs, shifting in their seats, waiting. A wave of panic washes over you, but then, as if by instinct, you raise your hands. The air hums with an invisible force, and suddenly, words begin to form—not from your mouth, but in glowing symbols that float above you.  

The audience gasps in awe as the luminous words spiral through the air, shifting and reshaping themselves into dazzling images. You realize you are not just giving a speech—you are weaving a story in light. The images shimmer, pulling the audience into a world of your making.  

As you grow more confident, the scene around you begins to shift. The stage dissolves, and you find yourself standing in a vast celestial expanse, the crowd floating weightlessly around you. Your words shape constellations, mountains, entire cities that rise and fall with your thoughts. The people watch, spellbound, as if witnessing the birth of a new reality.  

Then, out of the darkness, a single figure steps forward—taller than the others, eyes glowing with the same light as your words. They reach out a hand and, without speaking, ask you a question. You somehow understand it instantly:  

*"Are you ready to wake up?"*  

What do you do?
