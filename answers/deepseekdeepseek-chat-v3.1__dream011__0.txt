...not at all what you expected. They're not about formulas, theories, or historical dates. Instead, the first question is written in an elegant, almost calligraphic script:

**"1. What is your name, truly?"**

You blink, thinking it's a strange joke or a misprint. But as you scan the rest of the paper, your heart begins to beat a strange rhythm against your ribs. The questions only get more baffling.

**"2. Recount a memory you have hidden from yourself."**
**"3. Draw the shape of the sound of rain."**
**"4. With what intention did you wake up this morning?"**
**"5. Describe the color of joy to someone who has never felt it."**

Panic, cold and sharp, pricks at the edges of your consciousness. This isn't right. You look around the vast, silent exam hall. The other students are bent over their papers, pens scratching away furiously, as if these questions were as normal as solving an equation. No one else seems confused.

The invigilator at the front of the room catches your eye. It's not your professor, but an elderly woman with kind, deep-set eyes that seem to hold a universe of patience. She gives you a slow, gentle nod, as if to say, *"It's okay. You can do this."*

You look back at the paper. The words seem to shimmer slightly. You take a deep breath, pushing the academic anxiety aside. This is a different kind of test.

You pick up your pen. It feels unfamiliar in your hand, warmer, lighter. You press it to the paper to answer the first question. You write your name, but as you do, a thought flashes: *Is that just what I'm called, or is it who I am?* You cross it out. Below it, you write not the name on your birth certificate, but the one your best friend calls you when they're being sincere, the nickname your grandfather gave you, the one you call yourself in your bravest moments. It feels more true.

The memory you've hidden from yourself surfaces unbidden—a small, sharp moment of childhood cruelty you inflicted, forgotten out of shame. You write it down, and as the words form, the weight of it lessens, leaving only a lesson in its place.

For the shape of rain, you don't draw lines. You close your eyes for a second and remember the feeling of a sudden downpour. You draw a soft, rolling wave, like a gentle hill, with thousands of tiny dots dancing above it—not a shape seen, but a shape felt.

The intention you woke up with was fear. Pure, unadulterated fear of failure. You write that down, honestly. And then you add the intention you *wish* you had: to meet whatever comes with curiosity.

Finally, you describe joy. You write that it is the bright, clear yellow of a sunbeam hitting a clean sheet of paper, the warm orange of a hearth heard from a cold street, the exploding, silent silver of a firework behind closed eyelids. It is every color at once, but softer.

As you finish the last description, you expect the exam to be over. But a new line of text melts onto the page, as if written in invisible ink now revealed by your efforts.

**"Final Question: What career, then, will you choose for this self you have just described?"**

You don't hesitate. You don't write "doctor," "engineer," or "lawyer," the paths everyone expected of you. You look at your answers—the honest name, the forgiven memory, the felt shape, the acknowledged fear, the described joy.

You write a single word: **"Alive."**

The moment the pen leaves the paper, the exam hall dissolves around you. The desk, the other students, the room itself, all soften and melt into a brilliant, warm light. The old invigilator is still there, smiling. She isn't a teacher anymore, but a guide.

"You passed," she says, her voice like the rustling of leaves. "The course was not about a future career. It was about remembering yourself. The future is simply what you do next with that knowledge."

You wake up. The sun is streaming through your window. The anxiety about your future is still there, but it's quieter now, overshadowed by a profound and steady curiosity. You get out of bed, not sure what you will do that day, but knowing, truly, who you are.
