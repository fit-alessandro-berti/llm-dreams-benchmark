You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and each group seems to be speaking a language you almost understand but not quite. The words are on the tip of your tongue, familiar shapes without meaning.

You walk through a doorway and suddenly you're in your childhood home, but the rooms are in the wrong order. The kitchen leads to your old classroom. Your one friend must be here somewhere. You call their name, but when you open your mouth, you've forgotten it completely.

There are mirrors everywhere now, multiplying the crowds. You catch glimpses of your reflection but your face keeps shifting—sometimes younger, sometimes older, sometimes not quite your face at all. 

The groups of people turn to look at you, smiling with too many teeth, and you realize they've all been waiting for you to arrive. They want you to give a speech, but you haven't prepared anything. You look down and realize you're holding papers covered in writing that keeps rearranging itself.

Your friend appears finally, at the end of a hallway that's stretching longer as you walk. They're waving, calling you over, but their voice sounds like wind chimes. You try to run but your legs are moving through honey-thick air.

Then suddenly, mercifully, you're somewhere else entirely...
