The air in the grand ballroom is thick with perfume and laughter, but it tastes like dust in your mouth. Every face is a stranger’s—a blur of silk, sequins, and polite smiles that don’t reach their eyes. You’re searching for Clara. She promised to meet you here, near the fountain in the central courtyard. But the courtyard is a maze of people, and *she’s not where she said she’d be*.  

You push through a cluster of guests laughing too loudly—their joy sounds like shattering glass. One man holds a champagne flute, but the bubbles rise like mercury, hissing as they hit his skin. He doesn’t seem to notice. When you try to ask about Clara, his eyes glaze over, and he whispers, *“She’s always in the wrong room,”* before turning away.  

Further on, two women in emerald gowns stand perfectly still, their mouths moving in silent unison. They’re arguing about *the color of time*—one insists it’s “too blue,” the other says it’s “the wrong shade of silver.” When you step closer, they freeze mid-gesture, then tilt their heads in perfect sync. “Can you see it?” they chorus. “It’s leaking through the cracks.” You look down—faint silver threads are indeed weaving through the marble floor, snaking beneath your feet. You stumble back, heart pounding, and they dissolve into the crowd like smoke.  

Then you spot her. *Clara.* Standing by the grand piano, bathed in moonlight filtering through high windows. She’s wearing the lemon-yellow dress you’d imagined, her back to you. Relief floods you—*You found her!* You jog toward her, weaving through booksellers discussing “soul-bound paperweights” and chefs plating invisible soufflés that float above the tables.  

But as you reach her side, she turns—and her face is *yours*. Not a reflection, but a perfect mirror of *your own expression*: tired, searching, just as lost. She holds out a name tag. On it, in neat script, is *your name*—but the photo attached isn’t you. It’s a stranger with your eyes.  

*“You’ve been looking for yourself this whole time,”* she says—but her voice is hollow, echoing from somewhere far away. The ballroom walls begin to ripple like water. The guests’ laughter turns into the sound of wind through empty corridors.  

You wake with a gasp.  

It’s 3 a.m. Your room is dark, quiet. The phone beside your bed is silent. But for the first time, you don’t feel alone—because the dream wasn’t about the crowd. It was about the quiet space inside you where you’ve been searching for someone who wasn’t there. And now, in the stillness, you know: *you can be that person.*  

(Sleep comes easier this time.)
