…open your mouth to say it can’t be done, but the words come out as a flock of tiny paper cranes. They scatter across the conference table, pecking at Gantt charts until the timelines curl up like ferns. Your boss doesn’t notice; he is already sinking slowly into his swivel chair as if it were warm sand, nodding encouragingly, thumbs-up, descending.

You turn to your screen. It’s not a screen—it's a window into a stormy sky, and the cursor is a kite string humming in the wind. “All you have to do is catch the thunder,” someone says from the doorway. When you look, it’s you, wearing your lucky presentation sweater and a helmet miner’s lampshade bright with moths. Other-you winks, tosses you a stapler that becomes a silver fish midair, and you catch it by the tail. It wriggles into a pen. The ink smells like rain.

Your desk stretches into a hallway where every door is labeled Milestone. The first is ahead, close and far at once. When you open it, there’s a tiny house inside with every clock set to a different holiday. You pull the nearest minute hand and it becomes a zipper running across the sky. You unzip the day. Behind it is a soft, velvety night with stars arranged in bulleted tasks, each with a little checkbox. They hum when you look at them. Check, check, check. Music.

Your phone buzzes an alert that sounds like your grandmother saying, “Do it properly, pet,” and then dissolves into the sea foam that curls around your ankles. The carpet is an ocean now, gentle swells washing in a smell of coffee and ozone. The deadlines float by on driftwood signs: EOD, COB, ASAP. You pick up ASAP; it is light as a feather and heavy as a promise. You tuck it behind your ear like a pencil.

“I’ll need a team,” you say, and the office plants uproot themselves, revealing little faces among their leaves. The fern is a project manager with a soft green voice. The ficus knows Excel like a religion. The cactus does risk analysis with a single raised eyebrow spine. They cluster around your chair—your ship—raising sticky notes as sails. Yellow, pink, neon flagging the route: Deliverable, Dependency, Delight.

You hear your boss again, but now his voice comes from the ceiling vents, drifting like a weather report. “Looking forward to seeing what you come up with,” it says, and the vents exhale confetti of old emails that land on your tongue and taste of peppermint and deadlines missed and forgiven. You laugh, which sounds like a photocopier scanning a flock of geese.

The kite string tugs. You let it pull you through the window-screen-sky. You’re outside, above the building, above the city, where traffic maps knot and unknot like nets in a fisher’s hands. The project sits below you on the rooftop, a glowing cube with a tiny heartbeat. Impossible, someone told you. But impossibility is just a door no one tried the handle on. You reach down and it opens like the lid of a music box. Inside is a little ballerina made of to-do lists, spinning. She bows to you and leaps onto your shoulder, whispering steps: first this, then that, and oh, don’t forget to breathe.

You do. Breath becomes wind. Wind becomes time. Time becomes a ribbon you tie around the cube until it holds its shape. The ribbon is red like urgency and warm like a fresh idea. When you let go, it stays. The clouds applaud with polite thunder.

Back at your desk-ship, the plants cheer leafily. Your boss resurfaces, brushing sand from his tie as if nothing odd happened. “Great progress,” he says, eyes full of beach, and hands you a mug. The mug says You’ve Got This and inside is a small moon swirling in tea. You sip and feel your bones remember gravity, your chair remember the floor.

You click Send. The message flies out of your computer as a swallow and perches on the edge of the impossible deadline, chirping once, then twice, then splitting into a chorus of tiny chimes as the calendar squares light up one by one like windows in an early winter evening.

Your boss nods, your team rustles, your heartbeat steadies to the soft metronome of keys and rain. You watch the crane you didn’t notice before—one of your words—settle on the project plan and fold itself into a checkmark. The deadline blinks, blinks, then melts into the present like a chocolate square on the tongue.

You are still at your workplace, and the fluorescent lights hum the tune you suddenly realize you’ve always known. Impossible, they sing, is just another word for Not Yet. You roll your chair to the window to catch a little more sky in your cup. And you begin.
