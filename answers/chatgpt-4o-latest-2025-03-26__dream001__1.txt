You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to walk down a winding cobblestone street, hoping for a familiar landmark or a helpful stranger. The buildings tower around you like ancient giants, their windows glowing softly with warm, golden light that doesn’t seem to come from any sun you can see.

As you pass a shop filled with ticking clocks—hundreds of them, each showing a different time—you pause, feeling like you're being watched. An old man behind the counter looks up and says, "You're already late, unless you learn to stop chasing time."

You blink, confused, but something compels you to keep moving. The street forks strangely—one path leads into a forest that appears to grow straight through the city's heart, massive trees wrapped in neon vines; the other path leads into a mirror-walled tunnel where you only see images of yourself running in every direction.

You choose the tunnel.

As you run, each reflection begins to whisper to you, voices overlapping: *“You're close. Not much farther. But you have to remember…”*

Suddenly, you burst through the end of the tunnel and arrive in a vast circular plaza. In the center stands a spiral staircase leading upward into the clouds. An old elevator operator with a moth-eaten cap gestures toward the stairs and asks, “Do you have your invitation?”

You check your pockets—nothing. Panicked, you look around, but then, glowing faintly in your hand, is a small glass key pulsing with light.

The operator gazes at it, then at you, and smiles. “Right on time,” he says, though you never showed him a clock.

You place your foot on the first stair—and wake up.
