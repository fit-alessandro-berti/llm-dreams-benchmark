...find a way to survive—and perhaps, a way back.

The air is thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth. Around you, thatched cottages lean gently toward one another like whispering villagers. People in coarse woolen tunics hurry down muddy paths, eyes downcast, avoiding yours. No cars. No screens. No voices rising in frantic digital chatter—just the clang of a blacksmith’s hammer, the lowing of cattle, the rhythmic thud of a loom from an open doorway.

You look down. You’re wearing rough-spun linen, a far cry from the pajamas you fell asleep in. In your pocket, your phone is gone. In its place, a smooth river stone and a scrap of parchment with a single word scrawled in faded ink: *Remember.*

As you wander, a child running past drops a carved wooden bird. You pick it up, and as your fingers close around it, a jolt runs through you—a flash of memory: *you carved this. Long ago. In this very village.*

You realize with a breathless chill—you’re not just in a different era.  
You’re in your own past.

And you need to remember who you were before that identity fades completely. Because the elders speak in hushed tones about the "Seeker Who Vanishes," a spirit said to walk through time, doomed to forget unless they reclaim their true name before the autumn moon.

So you must seek the old well at the edge of the woods—the one locals avoid, where time pools like still water. But to reach it, you’ll need help. Allies. And you must earn their trust without revealing too much.

A woman with knowing eyes hands you a bowl of stew. "You’ve the look of one who’s lost,” she says. “But sometimes, to be found, you must first unravel."

You nod, clutching the wooden bird tighter.  
You need to remember.  
You need to speak the name carved beneath the bird’s wing—before the dream, or the past, consumes you.
