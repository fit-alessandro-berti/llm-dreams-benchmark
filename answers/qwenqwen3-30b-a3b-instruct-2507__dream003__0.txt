...intricate patterns etched into the dark, weathered wood—like vines spiraling inward toward the center of the lid, each leaf a tiny, swirling symbol you’ve never seen before. The patterns glow faintly, pulsing with a soft indigo light just beneath your fingertips, as if responding to your touch. 

Below the lid, almost hidden in a recessed groove, you find a single, smooth stone—cool and perfectly round, carved with a spiral that matches the patterns on the box. As you lift it, the wood groans softly, and a low hum fills the air. The box trembles. 

Suddenly, the patterns on the lid *shift*. The vines uncurl, reforming into a sequence of shifting glyphs—like a language of light. You realize: it’s not a lock you need to open, but a riddle.  

The stone in your hand suddenly warms. A whisper forms in your mind—not in words, but in feeling: *“You are not the first to hold me. But you are the one who remembers.”*

And then—without warning—the box begins to *bleed* light. A cascade of shimmering memories flood your mind: a child’s laughter on a summer shore, a hand reaching toward you across a starlit bridge, a lullaby sung in a language you’ve never spoken, but *know*.  

You’re still holding the stone. The box is open now—revealing not a treasure, but a mirror. And in the reflection, you see not your face… but the face of someone you’ve never met, yet recognize as deeply as your own.  

The dream doesn’t end. It *resonates*. You are not just dreaming.  
You are remembering.
