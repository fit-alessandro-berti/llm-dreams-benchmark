You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to feel a surge of confidence. The lights are bright, but you can still make out the faces in the front row, smiling encouragingly.

You take a deep breath and start your speech. Your voice is clear and strong, resonating through the auditorium. As you speak, you notice the audience hanging on to every word, nodding in agreement and occasionally breaking into applause.

Suddenly, the stage transforms into a beautiful garden, with vibrant flowers and gentle streams. The audience is now seated on soft grass, still listening intently. You continue your speech, now feeling a deep connection with everyone present.

As you reach the climax of your speech, a gentle breeze carries your words, amplifying them across the garden. The audience rises to their feet, giving you a standing ovation. You feel a profound sense of accomplishment and joy.

The dream shifts again, and you find yourself back in your bedroom, waking up with a smile on your face, feeling ready to take on the day.
