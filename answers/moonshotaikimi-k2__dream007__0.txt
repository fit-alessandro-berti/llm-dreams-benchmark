…stop mid-sentence.  

The room suddenly loses its edges—walls, ceiling, doors—everything melts into the kind of soft gray light you only get at the bottom of the ocean. My friend’s face is still in front of me, but it is also turning translucent, like a photograph printed on fog. His eyebrows stay knitted together in anger even as the rest of him slowly slips away.

I realize: the argument was only ever made of breath.  
Nothing that’s real—nothing that lasts—can be built only out of words that wound.

Instinctively, I lift my hand toward him, palm open, asking for palm against palm. I don’t apologize; no phrase would stretch across the distance fast enough. Instead I just wait, suspended in the gelatinous air, until I feel warmth pool into my hand. His outline fuses again, slate-gray solidifying into skin.

Neither of us speaks. We’re still each holding opposite sides of the disagreement—like two halves of the same strange stone, smooth on one face and jagged on the other—but we balance it together now, testing its weight.

Somewhere behind us, the room reconstructs itself from memory: yellow lamplight pooling on a pine table, two chipped coffee mugs, the southern window that never quite shuts. The argument isn’t erased; it’s just tucked into the quiet of the house, a knot of ash-colored rock resting on the sill. It will cool there, gradually, until one of us—maybe the next dream—can pick it up without wincing.
