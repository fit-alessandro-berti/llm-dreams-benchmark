The dream unfolds like this:

You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Neon signs blur into streaks of color, the roar of traffic and distant sirens create a constant, overwhelming hum. Your feet ache from wandering unfamiliar sidewalks, and the sheer density of people moving with purpose makes you feel invisible, adrift. A knot of anxiety tightens in your stomach. *Where am I? How do I get back?* The city feels like a labyrinth, and you've lost the map.

Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you...

...look up, startled, meeting their eyes. There are four of them, gathered around a steaming food cart. An older woman with kind eyes and a flour-dusted apron, a young man with bright blue hair and a gentle smile, a woman in a sharp business suit who’s already pulling out her phone, and a quiet-looking man with kind, observant eyes who offers you his slightly sticky soda can. They don't seem to mind your disorientation; they just look concerned.

"Hey there," the older woman says softly, her voice cutting through the city noise like a warm knife. "You look a little turned around, hon. Can we help?"

The young man nods. "Yeah, totally. Where are you trying to get to? We know this city inside out."

You blink, surprised by the sudden connection. The knot in your stomach starts to loosen. "...I... I'm trying to find the subway station near the old library. The one with the big bronze doors? But I think I took a wrong turn hours ago." Your voice sounds small and shaky.

The businesswoman glances at her phone screen. "Old Library Station? Yeah, that's a few blocks that way, but it's easy to miss the entrance. Come on, we'll walk with you." She starts typing rapidly.

The quiet man hands you the soda can. "Here, you look thirsty. It's root beer."

You take it, the coldness a shock against your palm. "Th-thank you. All of you. Why... why are you helping me?"

The young man grins. "Because that's what people do, right? Look out for each other." He winks.

As they fall into step beside you, the bustling city feels less like a hostile force and more like a backdrop. The older woman points out landmarks – "See that crooked clock tower? We're heading away from that..." – while the businesswoman pulls up a map. The quiet man just walks beside you, radiating a calm presence that feels like an anchor.

They guide you expertly through side streets you'd never have found, pointing out shortcuts and warning you about tricky intersections. They chat easily, asking you simple questions about where you're from, making you feel like you're part of the flow, not a lost object. The knot in your stomach dissolves completely, replaced by a spreading warmth. You laugh for the first time since you got lost.

At a corner, the businesswoman points. "See that green awning? The station entrance is just behind it."

You see it now, unmistakable. Relief washes over you, profound and sweet. "I... I don't know how to thank you," you stammer, looking at each of their faces – the flour dust on the apron, the blue hair catching the light, the sharp eyes softened by kindness, the quiet depth.

The older woman pats your arm. "Just pay it forward someday, that's all the thanks we need. Safe travels, sweetheart." She gives you a warm, genuine smile.

As you walk the last few steps towards the station entrance, you turn to wave. They're still standing there, a small, bright cluster of kindness against the city's vastness, watching you with friendly concern. The young man raises his soda can in a salute. The businesswoman gives a final thumbs-up. The quiet man nods, a silent wish for safe passage.

You step through the station doors, the familiar smell of underground travel enveloping you. As you buy your ticket, you look back through the large glass doors. They're still there, a warm, indistinct glow of humanity against the city's cold rhythm, fading into the crowd but leaving a trail of light behind them – a trail that now leads *to* you, not away. The dream softens at the edges, leaving you with the lingering, comforting warmth of being found in the middle of nowhere.
