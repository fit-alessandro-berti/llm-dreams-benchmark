You start to run, but your legs feel heavy, as if you are wading through thick, invisible syrup. The cobblestones beneath your feet shift and ripple like water with every step, making it impossible to gain traction.

The city around you is a kaleidoscope of impossible architecture. Skyscrapers twist like corkscrews into a violet sky, their windows glowing with eyes that blink in unison. Streetlamps float untethered in the air, casting long, distorted shadows that seem to detach from their owners and scurry away into alleyways that weren't there a moment ago.

Panic rises in your chest, cold and sharp. You reach into your pocket for your phone to check the address, but instead of a device, your hand closes around a warm, fluttering moth. It escapes your grip, dissolving into a cloud of golden dust that smells faintly of rain and old books.

Suddenly, a clock tower nearby begins to chime, but the sound isn't a bell; it's a voice, deep and resonant, counting backwards from sixty. With each number, the city accelerates. Buildings fold into themselves like origami, and the crowds of faceless pedestrians blur into streaks of color.

"You're late," a stranger whispers directly into your ear, though no one is standing beside you. They hand you a silver key made of ice that doesn't melt. "The meeting isn't somewhere you go; it's somewhere you remember."

As the countdown hits zero, the ground beneath you dissolves completely. You don't fall, though. Instead, you float upward, rising past the twisting towers, through the violet clouds, until you break through into a stark, white room. In the center sits a single wooden chair facing a window that looks out onto your own bedroom ceiling.

You sit down, and the panic vanishes instantly, replaced by a serene clarity. You realize the meeting was never about being on time; it was about waking up. The silver key in your hand turns into your alarm clock, ringing softly, pulling you gently back to the reality of your morning light.
