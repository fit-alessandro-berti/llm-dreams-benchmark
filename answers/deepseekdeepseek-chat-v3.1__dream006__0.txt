Of course. Here is a completion of that dream:

You step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak. The first words come out clearly, and a wave of confidence washes over you. But then, you glance down at your notes.

The pages are blank.

A cold dread prickles the back of your neck. You look back at the audience, but their faces have blurred into a sea of indistinguishable, silent features. You try to remember your opening line, the powerful anecdote you prepared, the structure of your argument—but your mind is a perfect, empty vault.

You clear your throat, the microphone amplifying the sound into a thunderous rumble. You mutter a few disjointed sentences, but they are meaningless, hollow sounds. A quiet cough echoes from the back of the room. Then another. A low, muffled laugh.

Panic rises in your chest, a physical pressure making it hard to breathe. You look down to steady yourself and realize you are not wearing pants. You are standing in front of this vast, silent audience in only your underwear and a formal jacket.

The silence breaks. The muted laughs turn into a roaring wave of laughter. The expectant faces are now contorted with mockery. The stage lights, once warm, become blindingly hot and begin to swell, pulsing like a heartbeat. You try to step back, to flee, but your feet are fused to the floorboards.

You look out, desperate for a friendly face, and you see your third-grade teacher in the front row, shaking her head in disappointment. A man in the third stands up—it's your boss—and slowly begins to clap, a slow, sarcastic clap that is quickly picked up by the entire audience until the room is a deafening cacophony of rhythmic, scornful applause.

You open your mouth to scream, but no sound comes out. The applause grows louder, the lights hotter, the laughter more intense, collapsing in on you until the world is nothing but noise and light and sheer, utter mortification.

And then, just as the feeling is about to consume you entirely... you wake up. Your heart is hammering against your ribs. The room is dark and quiet. You are in your own bed. And you are, thankfully, fully clothed.
