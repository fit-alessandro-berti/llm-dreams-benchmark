I step up to the podium, clutching the microphone. It feels cold and heavy in my hand, a stark contrast to the heat radiating from my face.

I look out, but the faces aren’t distinct anymore. They’ve merged into a single, shifting entity, like a sea of mist. The lights are blindingly bright, turning the front rows into silhouettes.

I open my mouth to speak the words I’ve rehearsed a thousand times. I know the opening line perfectly—it’s right there on the tip of my tongue—but when I try to speak, the microphone emits only a low, humming static. The sound vibrates through the stage, under my feet. The audience leans forward, their anticipation palpable, but they aren't looking at my face anymore. They are looking at my hands.

I glance down. The crumpled notecards I was holding are turning into origami birds. They flutter in my palm, unfolding and refolding themselves into intricate shapes. I try to press them flat, but they escape my fingers and rise into the air, swirling above the crowd like a flock of white paper doves.

The silence stretches, heavy and expectant. I need to say something, anything, to fill the void. I take a breath, but instead of words, a stream of tiny, glowing bubbles flows from my lips. They drift out into the auditorium, catching the light, reflecting the faces of the audience. As the bubbles pop against the front row, they release tiny, whispered fragments of forgotten conversations.

Panic gives way to a strange calm. The paper birds swoop down and begin to dance with the bubbles. The audience doesn't look confused; they look enchanted. I realize then that I don't need the script. I don't need the words at all.

I step out from behind the podium. I take a deep breath and, this time, I don't try to speak. I just begin to hum. The low note resonates, and the floor begins to sway gently, like the deck of a ship. The entire hall begins to dissolve, the walls melting into a starry sky. The audience isn't a crowd anymore; they are constellations, and I am conducting them with the movement of my hands. We are all floating, weightless, in the middle of a dream.

And just as the melody reaches its peak, the alarm clock rings.
