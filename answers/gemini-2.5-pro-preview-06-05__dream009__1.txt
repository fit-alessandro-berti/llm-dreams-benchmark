Of course. Let us continue the dream...

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth. A coarse wool blanket scratches your skin. Sunlight, thick and golden, filters through a small, paneless window, illuminating a universe of dancing dust motes. You sit up, your head swimming with the ghostly chime of a notification that will never arrive.

As you explore your new surroundings—a cobblestone street where timber-framed houses lean on each other for support, the air a thick stew of baking bread, horse manure, and unwashed humanity—you realize you need to **find the source of the music.**

It’s not music anyone else seems to hear. The blacksmith hammering at his anvil, the women haggling over a basket of fish, the children chasing a hoop down the lane—they are all deaf to it. But for you, it’s a constant, ethereal melody playing just behind your own thoughts. It’s a haunting tune played on an instrument you can’t name, both melancholic and strangely hopeful. It feels more real than the hard ground beneath your bare feet.

This need becomes an obsession, a compass needle in your soul. You ask a woman with a kind face, pointing to your ear and humming the tune. She just shakes her head, her eyes filled with a pity reserved for the simple-minded. You try to follow the sound, but it’s maddeningly omnidirectional, as loud in a noisy tavern as it is in a quiet, sun-dappled churchyard.

Days, or perhaps just moments, pass in this dream-like haze. You learn to recognize the taste of the hard, dark bread and the clean bite of well water. You learn that the people here speak a language that sounds like birdsong and rushing water, and though you don't understand the words, you begin to understand the tones of kindness, suspicion, and fear.

But always, the music is there. Your constant, invisible companion.

One evening, as the sky turns a bruised purple and the first stars appear, you follow a hunch. The music seems to pull you away from the huddled warmth of the village, towards the dark silhouette of the forest that looms at its edge. The path grows faint, the trees closing in, their branches like skeletal fingers against the fading light.

The music grows louder, clearer. You can now distinguish the notes, a crystalline cascade that makes the hairs on your arms stand up. It leads you to a small clearing, where a circle of massive, ancient standing stones glows faintly under the rising moon.

And in the center of the circle sits an old man.

He is not playing an instrument. He is sitting perfectly still on the damp moss, his eyes closed. His clothes are rags, but he holds himself with an immense, quiet dignity. The music is not coming *from* him, but *through* him. It emanates from the very air around him, as if he is a conduit, an antenna for a song broadcast from the stars themselves.

He opens his eyes. They are a startling, pale blue, and they seem to look right through you, back to the world of glass screens and electric light you came from.

He doesn't speak. He simply raises a hand and points to a small, empty patch of moss opposite him. An invitation.

You realize, with a sudden, gut-wrenching certainty, what you need to do. You need to sit down. You need to close your eyes. You need to be still.

You need to learn how to listen.

You sit, crossing your legs on the cool moss. The old man gives a slow, single nod of approval. As you close your eyes and breathe in the scent of pine and ancient stone, the world falls away. The anxiety, the confusion, the desperation to go "home"—it all dissolves.

There is only the music. And for the first time, you are not just hearing it. You are a part of it. A single, quiet note in an eternal, cosmic song. And you feel a profound sense that this, right here, is what you were supposed to find all along.
