...and you **gratefully accept, relief washing over you like warm rain.** The noise of the city seems to dim slightly as they gather around you, their faces kind but indistinct, like watercolour paintings left out in a drizzle.

One of them, who feels like an old woman though her features shift and blur, offers you a steaming cup of something that smells like cinnamon and forgotten attics. "Drink this," she says, her voice like rustling silk, "It helps steady the compass." You take a sip, and the hot liquid doesn't burn, but instead fills you with a sense of calm direction, though you still don't know *where* you're going.

Another, tall and thin like a lamppost bent by the wind, points not down a street, but towards a shimmering doorway that seems to hang unsupported in mid-air, right next to a grimy newsstand. "The currents are favourable this way tonight," he explains matter-of-factly.

Hesitantly, you follow them. As you step towards the shimmering portal, the bustling city sounds fade completely, replaced by the gentle chime of distant bells and the soft sighing of wind through unseen trees. You pass through the doorway...

...and find yourself standing not on pavement, but on soft moss. You're in a vast, quiet library, rows upon rows of towering shelves stretching into misty infinity. The kind strangers are beside you, smiling gently. The air smells of old paper, dust, and moonlight.

"You weren't lost in the city," the old woman figure murmurs, gesturing around at the endless books. "You were just looking for the right story to step into."

You feel a profound sense of peace, no longer alone, but surrounded by infinite possibilities. You reach out to touch the spine of a nearby book, its title glowing faintly in a language you don't know, yet somehow understand perfectly... and the dream shifts again...
