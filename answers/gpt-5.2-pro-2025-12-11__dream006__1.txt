…begin to speak—and your voice comes out perfectly calm, as if someone has tuned it like an instrument. The microphone isn’t even on, yet every person in the hall hears you clearly. You glance down at the podium to find your notes, but instead of paper there’s a shallow bowl filled with water, smooth as glass.

A hush settles over the room. In the water, words drift up from the bottom like pale fish: whole sentences, then fragments, then a single phrase that keeps re-forming no matter how you blink. You try to read it, but the letters slip away whenever you focus too hard, so you stop trying to force it and let your eyes soften.

The phrase finally holds still:

**“Tell them what you’re afraid to admit.”**

You swallow. Your hands, which you expected to shake, rest easily on the edges of the bowl. The water feels cool and impossibly familiar, like it belongs to you.

You look out at the audience again. The faces are not strangers anymore. You recognize them in odd, mismatched ways: the woman in the third row has your teacher’s posture; the man near the aisle has your brother’s laugh caught in his jaw; someone farther back wears your own expression from a memory you can’t place. They’re waiting, but not impatiently—more like they’ve been waiting a long time and are relieved you finally arrived.

You start with the speech you prepared. The opening line lands cleanly, even a little funny, and the room responds with a soft, synchronized nod as if they’ve heard it before. But the words feel rehearsed in your mouth, hollow in a way you can taste.

The lights above you shift. Not brighter—truer. The stage seems to widen, stretching into a long pier over dark water. The podium is still there, but now it’s the only solid thing. The audience sits like rows of lanterns in the distance, their faces faintly glowing.

You take a breath and let the next sentence come without choosing it.

“I’m scared,” you say, and the two words hit the room with the weight of something honest.

The water in the bowl ripples. The microphone stand—though you never touched it—leans closer.

You keep going, surprising yourself. You talk about what you usually hide: the pressure to be impressive, the fear of being ordinary, the quiet suspicion that you’re always a step behind everyone else even when you’re doing well. You admit you rehearse conversations after they’re over, searching for mistakes like splinters. You confess that praise makes you anxious because it feels like a contract you might not be able to fulfill.

As you speak, the audience changes. Some people blur into silhouettes. Others become clearer, as if your honesty is focusing them. In the front row, a child swings their feet and watches you with open interest—not judgment, just attention. You realize, with a sudden tenderness, that the child is you.

The bowl on the podium begins to fill, though nothing is pouring into it. The water rises slowly, and with each admission, a small object surfaces: a house key, a paper crown, a cracked phone screen, a dried leaf, a tiny mirror. Each one floats for a moment and then dissolves into light, as if the water is forgiving it.

A murmur moves through the audience—not whispering, but the sound of wind passing through a field.

You reach the part where you’re supposed to conclude. You search for an ending that sounds strong, the way endings are supposed to sound, but nothing polished will fit.

So you say, “I don’t know what happens next.”

The room doesn’t collapse into disappointment. Instead, something in the air loosens, like a knot finally undone. The faces in the crowd soften. A few people smile. Someone near the back exhales loudly, as if they’ve been holding their breath on your behalf.

The stage tilts gently forward, not dangerously—more like a bow.

And then, from somewhere above the lights, a single sheet of paper drifts down, slow as a feather. It lands on the podium beside the bowl. This one has only one line written on it in your handwriting:

**“Now tell the truth with your life.”**

You lift your eyes to the audience to see if they’ve read it too, but the seats are empty.

The hall is empty.

Only the sound remains: your own voice fading into quiet, and beneath it the steady, patient rhythm of water.

You look down at the bowl again. The surface shows not words this time, but a doorway—plain, half-open, with morning light spilling through the crack. You can hear distant birds, the clink of a spoon in a mug, the small ordinary noises of a day beginning.

You reach out, not to grab anything, but to touch the water lightly with one finger.

The doorway widens.

And as you step toward it, you wake with the feeling that the speech is still continuing somewhere, just out of earshot, and that you can choose—today—whether to finish it.
