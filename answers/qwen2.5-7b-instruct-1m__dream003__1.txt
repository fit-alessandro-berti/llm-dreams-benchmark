symbols etched into the surface, glowing faintly in hues of blue and gold. The box seems to pulse with an internal energy, as if it's alive. You reach out to touch it, and your hand passes right through, leaving no mark.

Suddenly, a voice resonates within your mind, soft yet insistent: *"Seek not the key, but the truth within."*

Confused, you step back, and the box begins to rotate slowly on its own, revealing a series of hidden compartments. Each compartment contains a single object: a small, delicate compass, a piece of folded parchment, a crystal that refracts light into a spectrum of colors, and a tiny, intricately carved figurine of a bird.

You pick up the compass first. It points not toward north, but toward the center of the room where there is only a blank wall. You turn the compass over, and on the bottom, etched in the same symbols as the box, is a message: *"The path lies within."*

Next, you unfold the parchment. It reveals a map, but not one of a familiar landscape. Instead, it shows a series of symbols and lines that seem to represent a journey through time and space. At the center of the map is a single, glowing star.

You place the compass and parchment aside and take the crystal next. When you hold it up, it begins to hum softly, and you can hear the faint sound of wind and distant voices. The crystal shifts slightly, and you see a glimpse of a vast library filled with ancient texts and knowledge beyond comprehension.

Finally, you examine the carved bird figurine. It feels warm to the touch, and when you look closely, you notice that the wings are made of light, flickering like fireflies. The figure seems to be in flight, but toward what destination, you cannot tell.

The voice returns, this time more urgent: *"The key is not in your hands, but in your heart."*

You stand there, holding the objects, each one whispering secrets of its own. The box continues to glow faintly, its surface now shimmering with new patterns that seem to reflect your innermost thoughts.

What do you do next?
