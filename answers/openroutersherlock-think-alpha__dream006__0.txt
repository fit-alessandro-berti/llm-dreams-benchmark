You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to speak, but your words come out as a flock of colorful birds, fluttering from your mouth and swirling around the auditorium. The audience gasps in delight, standing on their chairs to catch the birds, which perch on their shoulders and whisper secrets only you can hear.

Emboldened, you gesture grandly, and the stage morphs into a vast ocean liner sailing through cotton-candy clouds. Your microphone turns into a golden telescope, through which you spot distant islands shaped like forgotten childhood toys. "Friends!" you declare, your voice now booming like thunder wrapped in velvet, "We must navigate the skies of possibility!"

But then, the birds return, forming words in the air: "Wake up." The crowd dissolves into swirling mist, the liner tips sideways, and you tumble gently into your bed, heart racing, a smile lingering as the alarm clock chirps like one last escaped finch.
