**Dream Continuation:**  

As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns etched into the metal—delicate spirals, interlocking triangles, and faint constellations that seem to shift when you tilt the box. A faint hum vibrates beneath your fingertips as you trace the designs. Suddenly, one of the constellations glows—a tiny cluster of stars forming an arrow pointing to a hidden seam along the box’s edge.  

You press the glowing spot, and the box responds by unfolding like a flower, each panel rotating silently until it rests open in your hands. Inside, instead of a treasure, you find a smaller object: a smooth, obsidian mirror reflecting nothing but a starless night sky. When you glance closer, the mirror’s surface ripples, and a voice—not heard but *felt*—whispers, *"What’s locked can only be undone by what you refuse to see."*  

Suddenly, the box dissolves into mist, and you’re standing in a vast desert under a twin-mooned sky, the mirror now a compass spinning wildly in your palm. One direction glows faintly, pulling you forward…  

You wake up clutching a cold key you don’t remember finding.
