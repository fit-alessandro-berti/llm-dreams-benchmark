...not in any language you can read. The letters are familiar—A, B, C, the curves and lines of the Roman alphabet—but they’re arranged in a way that makes no sense. It looks like a dense, academic paper that has been put through a scrambler.

A cold dread washes over you. You look around the silent, cavernous hall. The other students are already writing furiously, the scratch of their pens a frantic, rhythmic counterpoint to your own pounding heart. They seem to understand it perfectly.

You frantically flip through the pages, hoping for a diagram, a number, anything you can grasp. But it's all the same: elegant, impenetrable code. Your future, the career you've worked for, is dissolving in front of you because of a clerical error, a cruel joke.

Just as panic is about to consume you, you notice something. A small, handwritten note is tucked into the seam of the desk. It’s in your own handwriting.

*"Don't read the words. Read the white space between them."*

You look back at the exam paper, your eyes blurring, trying to defocus. And then you see it. The letters aren't random. The negative space between them, the gaps and silences, forms a different set of shapes. They coalesce into symbols, into a visual language of logic and mathematics. The questions aren't about recalling facts; they're about perceiving patterns hidden in plain sight.

You pick up your pen. The first answer isn't a sentence, but a shape you draw in the margin. The paper seems to hum softly under your hand. You understand now. This isn't a test of what you know. It's a test of how you see. And you begin to write, not in words, but in the silent, spacious language of the dream.
