Here's a possible continuation of the dream:

You start to walk down the crowded, unfamiliar streets, the buildings towering around you in a maze of glass and concrete. Your phone seems useless - the screen is blurry, and the map keeps shifting whenever you try to focus on it. The streets are filled with people who move past you quickly, their faces indistinct and blending together.

You feel a growing sense of urgency as time seems to slip away. Each turn you take leads you to another identical-looking street, and you can't shake the feeling that you're walking in circles. Occasionally, you catch glimpses of a clock in a shop window or on a distant tower, but the time never seems to make sense.

A stranger approaches you and hands you a cryptic envelope without saying a word. When you open it, instead of information about your meeting, there's only a strange symbol drawn in what looks like silver ink. The symbol seems to shimmer and move when you look directly at it.

As panic starts to rise in your chest, you realize you're not sure what the meeting is about, who it's with, or why it's so important. But you know, with absolute certainty, that missing it is not an option...
