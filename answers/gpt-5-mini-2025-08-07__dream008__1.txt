freeze. Your mouth goes dry; fluorescent lights hum like a swarm. The clock above the copy machine is a disc of mercury, time slopping and reshaping itself into numbers you don't recognize. Your boss stands at your desk — not exactly your boss anymore, but a tall, impatient mannequin with your old high school blazer, tapping a metronome that ticks louder with every swallowed breath.

You try to speak, but the words come out as receipts that unravel across the floor. Each receipt lists a deadline more impossible than the last: "Tonight," "Before sunrise," "Before you learn how to breathe." You reach for coffee; the mug fills with tiny paper cranes that flutter away carrying bullets of text. Panic wants to take over, but something in you remembers the rules of this place: nothing here needs to obey the rules from outside.

So you decide to change the rules. You close your eyes and imagine a table large enough to hold the whole project. When you open them, a dining table appears, lacquered and warm, and from the drawers slide collaborators — versions of yourself wearing different hats: the meticulous proofreader, the coder who used to stay up all night, the colleague who could translate jargon into music. They smile, sit down, and start folding the cranes into neat stacks.

Time acquiesces. The mercurial clock slows to a steady pulse, the metronome's ticking becomes a heartbeat. Pages align themselves into a single, humming blueprint. You and your assembled selves work without panic, not because the task got easier, but because the impossible deadline lost its power once you wouldn't race it alone. The mannequin-boss tilts its head, expression smoothing into something like gratitude.

When the last fold slides into place, the office melts into a hallway of doors, each labeled with a tomorrow. You pick one, step through, and find yourself in bed, the early-morning light soft on the sheets. Your phone buzzes with a message: "Are you awake?" For a second you don't know whether you solved the deadline or simply learned how to refuse being frightened by it. Then the room breathes with a normal, human kind of time, and you breathe back.
