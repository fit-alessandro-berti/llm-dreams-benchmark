You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you stand at the helm, salt-stinging eyes fixed on the horizon where the sky bleeds into the waves like spilled ink. The wind howls secrets in a language of thunder, and the deck pitches like a drunkard's laugh. Below, your sailors—shadows with faces half-remembered from forgotten ports—huddle around the lanterns, their whispers a chorus of doubt: "Captain, the stars have drowned. What now?"

You grip the wheel, knuckles white as bone, and feel the wood pulse beneath your palms, alive, whispering back. It's not fear in your chest, but a wild certainty, born from dreams within dreams. "Lash the sails!" you bellow, voice cutting through the gale like a blade. "And ready the harpoons—not for whales, but for the clouds themselves!" They scramble, ropes singing, eyes wide with the fever of your command, because in this storm, madness is the only map.

As lightning fractures the world into shards of silver, you spot it: a rift in the roiling black, not rain but a cascade of glowing fish, scales like shattered emeralds, leaping upward from the depths. The sea boils, and the ship surges forward, carried on a current that defies the wind. Your first mate, old Elias with his salt-cracked grin, shouts over the roar, "Sir, the waves—they're parting like a theater curtain!"

And they are. The ocean splits, revealing not abyss but a submerged city of coral spires and bioluminescent streets, where merfolk in armor of pearl watch from arched windows, their eyes like lanterns in the murk. The storm above? It's no rage of nature, but a jealous veil, torn asunder by your unyielding will. You steer straight into the heart of it, the crew whooping now, transformed from men to myths.

But as the ship dives—yes, dives, hull kissing water without splintering—the world tilts, colors bleeding into one another. The sea becomes sky, the crew feathers and wings, and you? You awaken mid-flight, the wheel now a tiller of stars, laughing as the dream folds itself away like a map to nowhere. Or was it everywhere? The salt on your lips lingers, and somewhere, faintly, the thunder calls your name.
