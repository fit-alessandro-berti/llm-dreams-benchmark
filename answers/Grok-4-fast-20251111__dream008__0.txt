You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you freeze, staring at the stack of papers that have somehow multiplied into a towering ziggurat of spreadsheets, blueprints, and what looks suspiciously like ancient hieroglyphics. The clock on the wall ticks backward, each second a thunderclap, and your boss—now inexplicably wearing a top hat and monocle—taps his foot with the rhythm of a metronome gone rogue.

Panic surges, but then the floor beneath you ripples like water, and you plunge through it into a vast, underground cavern lit by bioluminescent coffee mugs floating like fireflies. Down here, the project isn't a report; it's a living beast—a mechanical dragon forged from tangled Ethernet cables and overdue invoices, snoring puffs of printer toner into the air. Your boss lands beside you with a polite *thud*, dusting off his suit. "Well?" he says, as if this is all perfectly normal. "The deadline's in five minutes. Chop chop."

You scramble for tools that aren't there, but your hands glow with an otherworldly light, and suddenly you *know* things: quantum algorithms for untangling bureaucracy, spells to debug existential errors. The dragon stirs, its eyes flickering open like malfunctioning screens, and it belches a fireball that singes your tie. You dodge, laughing maniacally because in dreams, fear tastes like adrenaline-spiked espresso. With a flourish, you weave code into chains, binding the beast's wings until it shrinks to the size of a keychain bobblehead, purring contentedly.

The cavern dissolves into confetti, and you're back at your desk—but now it's a throne in a boardroom orbiting Saturn's rings. Your boss claps slowly, his monocle reflecting the rings' icy gleam. "Impressive," he drawls. "But the *real* deadline is breakfast." The papers erupt into butterflies, each one whispering stock tips as they flutter toward the window.

You wake up tangled in your sheets, heart racing, the alarm blaring like a victory fanfare. The dream lingers like half-remembered code, and for a moment, you swear you can still smell toner and cosmic dust. What a way to start the day—impossible projects be damned, you've got this.
