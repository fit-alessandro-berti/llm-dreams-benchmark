You begin to speak, but the words come out as a symphony of bird calls, fluttering and melodic. The audience leans in, mesmerized, their faces morphing into giant sunflowers turning toward your voice. Suddenly, the stage tilts like a funhouse slide, and you surf down a river of liquid gold toward a horizon where the sky rains applause—thunderous claps that taste like cotton candy. You laugh, weightless, as the crowd joins you in flight, soaring into a nebula of forgotten childhood toys. And just as a massive clock made of cheese melts overhead, you wake up, heart racing, with feathers in your hair.
