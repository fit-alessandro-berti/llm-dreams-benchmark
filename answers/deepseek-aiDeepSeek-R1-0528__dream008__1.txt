Here’s how the dream might unfold, capturing the tension and surreal logic of dreams:

**You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you...**  
...stare blankly at the 500-page document glowing on your screen. The deadline reads "YESTERDAY" in pulsing red letters. Your boss taps their foot, morphing into a giant clock with your face on its pendulum. Sweat drips onto your keyboard as you type frantically, but every keystroke echoes like thunder. Colleagues swirl around you in fast-forward, blurring into faceless shadows.  

You try to speak, but your voice is muted. The project file sprouts vines, crawling up your arms. Your boss-clock chimes *"TICK-TOCK"* — each chime shatters a monitor. Desperate, you sprint down an endless hallway where doors labeled "SOLUTIONS" vanish as you reach them.  

Suddenly, you’re back at your desk. The project is now a single sticky note: **"MAKE THE SUN RISE WEST."** Your boss points at a countdown timer melting like Dali’s clock. You laugh hysterically as the floor dissolves into ocean...  

**...Then you wake up.**  
Heart pounding. Sheets tangled. Relief floods you — until your real alarm blares. *Today’s actual deadline* winks from your phone.  

### Why This Works in Dream Logic:
- **Impossible Tasks:** Shifting deadlines ("YESTERDAY"), absurd demands ("MAKE THE SUN RISE WEST").  
- **Anxiety Symbols:** Muted voice, melting time, endless hallways.  
- **Surreal Twists:** Boss as a clock, documents sprouting vines.  
- **False Awakening:** "Waking" into another layer of stress (real deadline).  

Dreams amplify real fears — here, it’s the dread of being unprepared and the loss of control. The subconscious twists workplace pressure into physical impossibilities, revealing how overwhelming it feels. What resonates most with your own work stress?
