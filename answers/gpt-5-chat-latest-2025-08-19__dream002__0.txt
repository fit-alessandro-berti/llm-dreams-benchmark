…the air grows heavy, charged with a strange electricity. The leaves above you shiver, and the forest that was once calm now seems to be holding its breath. A low rumble echoes in the distance, but it feels deeper than thunder—like the sound is resonating from the ground beneath your feet.  

The path you were following slowly blurs, as though the forest itself is trying to shift its layout. Branches weave together overhead, forming archways that pulse faintly with light. The storm draws nearer, flashes cutting across the sky, but the lightning is not the usual white—it glows in colors you’ve never quite seen before, iridescent and shimmering like liquid gemstones.  

Then you notice something: the rain is not falling down. Droplets spiral upwards from the forest floor, rising into the storm like sparks being pulled toward an unseen fire. A sense of urgency pushes you forward, yet you aren't afraid—there’s a knowing that whatever waits within this storm is somehow meant for you.  

As you take your next step, you see a figure ahead, cloaked in the same shifting light as the storm, waiting silently at the heart of the woods. Their outline flickers as though they are both there and not there.  

Do you want the dream to continue as something **mystical and comforting**, or **mysterious and unsettling**?
