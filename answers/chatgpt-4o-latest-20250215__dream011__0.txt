written in a language you’ve never seen before. The letters shift and dance on the page, rearranging themselves every time you blink. Your pulse quickens. You look around the exam hall—other students are furiously writing, as if they understand perfectly. 

A voice whispers from the paper itself: *"You already know the answers. Just remember."*  

You press your pen to the page, and suddenly, memories from a life you don’t recall come flooding back. You see yourself in a grand library filled with ancient tomes, studying symbols that glow with a soft golden light. You hear echoes of a past self reciting incantations, solving riddles whispered by unseen voices.  

The letters on the exam paper stabilize. You understand them now. But as you start writing, the floor beneath your desk dissolves, and you begin to fall. Down, down, through swirling colors and constellations of knowledge. The pages of the exam rise around you like wings, lifting you through an endless sky of possibilities.  

A final question flashes before you: *"Where do you want to go?"*  

You hesitate, feeling the weight of the decision pressing against your chest. The ink in your pen glows, waiting.
