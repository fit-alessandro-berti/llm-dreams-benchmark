...all written in a language you don't recognize.  It's a swirling script of symbols that seem to shift and change before your eyes, like watercolors bleeding into each other.  Panic rises in your chest, a cold, clammy dread. You try to remember anything from the lectures, anything that might give you a clue, but your mind is blank, a vast, echoing emptiness.  The proctor, a figure shrouded in shadows who seems both impossibly tall and impossibly small at the same time, merely smiles a knowing, unsettling smile.

You reach for your pencil, a heavy, leaden object in your trembling hand.  As you try to write, the pencil itself begins to morph, its wood turning to shimmering, iridescent scales. The scales whisper secrets in the unfamiliar script, a language of scales and shadows.  You realize with a dawning horror that the exam isn't about knowledge at all; it's about *understanding*... understanding something beyond words, beyond comprehension.

Then, the room dissolves.  You’re falling, not through air, but through a swirling vortex of the strange script, each symbol a portal to a different, unknowable reality. The whispering intensifies, becoming a chorus of voices, both terrifying and strangely beautiful, guiding you… or perhaps, judging you.  You wake up with a gasp, your heart pounding, the strange script still faintly imprinted on the back of your eyelids. The lingering taste of fear and… something else. Something like understanding, a whisper of a feeling too vast to grasp.
