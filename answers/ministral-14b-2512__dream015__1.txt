**Dream Continuation:**

You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **follow the faintest whisper of a memory**—a childhood song your grandmother used to hum, one that always made you feel safe. The melody lingers in your mind like a ghost, and you realize it’s coming from the ruins of an old library, half-buried under the skeletal remains of a collapsed skyscraper.

As you step through the debris, the air smells of damp paper and something metallic—blood, maybe, or rust. The shelves are skeletal, their spines cracked, but one book remains untouched, its cover still vibrant: *"The Last Gardener’s Guide."* You pick it up, and the pages flutter open to a pressed flower—your grandmother’s favorite, a bluebell—bookmarked between two pages. The ink is fresh, as if someone just left it there.

A voice, soft and weary, speaks from the shadows:
*"You’re not the first to hear it. But you’re the first to listen."*

You turn. A figure stands in the dim light—a woman wrapped in layers of patched-up fabric, her face lined with scars but her eyes sharp with something like hope. She holds a lantern that doesn’t flicker, its flame burning blue. *"The song isn’t just a memory,"* she says. *"It’s a map. And the garden isn’t where you think it is."*

She leads you deeper into the ruins, where the walls pulse faintly with bioluminescent moss, and the ground beneath your feet shifts like living tissue. The song grows louder, and suddenly, you’re no longer in the city. You’re standing in a vast, overgrown greenhouse, its glass domes cracked but still holding back the storm outside. Rows of twisted, glowing plants stretch into the distance, their leaves humming with the same melody.

At the center, a single door stands open, its frame carved with symbols you recognize from the book. Inside, you find not a garden, but a **child**—no older than ten—sitting cross-legged on a bed of soil, tending to a sapling that bears fruit shaped like tiny, perfect stars. The child looks up, and you see your own face in their eyes.

*"You’ve been waiting for me,"* you say.

The child smiles. *"No. You’ve been waiting for yourself."*

And then—

**What happens next?**
*(Do you:*
- **Pick the star-fruit and eat it, trusting the child’s word that it will "unlock the door in your mind"?**
- **Ask the woman about the "real" garden—the one beyond the ruins, where the song truly ends?**
- **Realize the child is a future version of you, and the garden is a test you’ve already failed—and now you must choose whether to break the cycle?**
- *Or something else entirely?)*
