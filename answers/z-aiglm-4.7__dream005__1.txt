...and you realize that no matter how closely you listen, their conversations are just the sound of rushing water, overlapping and crashing against one another.

You weave through the crowd, searching for a familiar face, but the room seems to stretch and elongate with every step you take. The walls dissolve into a dense, swirling fog, and the guests transform into faceless mannequins wearing tuxedos made of mirrors. You catch your reflection in a passerby’s jacket—your own face is blurred, as if seen through rainy glass.

Suddenly, you spot your friend standing in the distance, bathed in a single, bright spotlight. You call out to them, but your voice comes out as the chirping of a bird. You try to run, but your legs are heavy, like you are moving through deep mud. Just as you reach them, they turn around, but instead of a face, they have a clock for a head, the hands spinning wildly. The ticking gets louder and louder, drowning out the sound of the ocean-party, until the floor drops out from beneath you and you are falling, not down, but up into a sky filled with floating eyes.
