feel your heart racing as you glance at the calendar—only **24 hours** to complete what should take weeks. The office around you blurs into a surreal haze, fluorescent lights flickering like distant stars. Your keyboard feels alien under your fingers, but as you start typing, something strange happens...

The code writes *itself*. Lines of Python scroll across the screen in a hypnotic rhythm, as if the machine has gained sentience:  

```python
def solve_impossible_project():
    # The answer was inside you all along
    return "Ctrl + Z reality, wake up at 3 AM with the solution"
```

Your boss morphs into a giant clock, ticking louder with each second—**tick, tock, TICK**—until the numbers peel off and swirl into a vortex. You realize: *this isn’t work anymore*. It’s a puzzle-box dream, and the real deadline is... waking up.  

Just as you gasp for air—  
*Alarm rings.* ☕️  

(Would you like to explore the dream further, or analyze its symbolism? 😉)
