Okay, I'm settling into the dream...

You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are... **not written in any language you recognize. Instead, they're a series of intricate, pulsating hieroglyphs that seem to squirm on the page. As you squint, trying to decipher them, one symbol detaches itself, floats off the paper, and transforms into a tiny, iridescent hummingbird that buzzes angrily around your head.**

You glance around. The other students are calmly writing, their pens scratching diligently. But their pens aren't normal pens; one is writing with a carrot, another with a flickering candle, and a third seems to be dictating answers to a small, attentive squirrel perched on their desk.

The proctor, who you now realize is your childhood teddy bear, grown to human size and wearing a stern monocle, clears its throat (a sound like rustling cotton) and announces, "You have three heartbeats to begin. And please, no interpretive dance for question four. We had issues with that last semester."

You look back at your paper. The hummingbird is now trying to peck your eye out, and the hieroglyphs have rearranged themselves into a detailed map of your own anxieties, labeled in what looks suspiciously like your own tear-stains. Your pencil, when you try to pick it up, feels like a wet noodle. You try to ask for a new one, but only a faint squeak escapes your lips.

The clock on the wall isn't showing numbers, but phases of the moon, rapidly cycling. The room begins to gently tilt, and the scent of burnt toast and regret fills the air. This is going to be a *long* exam.
