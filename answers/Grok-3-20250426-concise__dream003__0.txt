symbols glowing faintly on the surface. You trace a pattern with your finger, and the box hums, opening to reveal a swirling portal. Stepping through, you find yourself in a vibrant forest where trees whisper secrets. A cloaked figure approaches, offering a choice: a golden key or a silver map. You choose the key, and the figure vanishes. The key pulses, guiding you to a hidden door in a tree. Unlocking it, you step into a starry void, weightless, with a voice echoing, "The dream is yours to shape." You imagine a castle in the stars, and it materializes, yours to explore forever.
