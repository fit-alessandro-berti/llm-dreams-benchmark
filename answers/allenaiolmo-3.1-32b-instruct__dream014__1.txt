accept their kindness, feeling a warmth bloom in your chest despite the crowd around you. As you walk together, the strangers share stories of their own journeys through uncertainty, their voices weaving a tapestry of hope and understanding. With each step, the city's noise fades, replaced by laughter and gentle encouragement. You realize you're not alone after all; the city, once overwhelming, now feels full of possibility. The strangers point you toward a quiet park, where the night sky is just beginning to sparkle with stars, and you pause, grateful for the unexpected connection that has guided you home.
