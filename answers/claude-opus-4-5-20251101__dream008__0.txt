*blinks and looks down at my hands, which seem to flicker between solid and translucent*

I open my mouth to explain that the deadline is unreasonable, but instead of words, small origami birds flutter out and scatter across the conference room. My boss doesn't seem to notice. She's tapping her pen, but each tap sounds like a distant church bell.

I turn to my computer, but the keyboard has become a piano—a tiny one, the size of a sandwich. I begin typing anyway, and somehow it works, though each keystroke plays a minor chord that hangs in the air like fog.

The project files are all written in a language I've never seen but completely understand. It's about... cataloging the dreams of extinct animals? Yes, that feels right.

I realize I've been working for what feels like years, but the clock on the wall is melting like soft cheese, its hands spinning backward. My coffee cup is bottomless—I keep drinking but it stays full, and it tastes like the color blue.

My boss walks over to check my progress. She's now somehow also my third-grade teacher. She nods approvingly.

\'ve finished,\ she says, though I haven't.

And I realize she's right.

*The walls begin dissolving into morning light...*
