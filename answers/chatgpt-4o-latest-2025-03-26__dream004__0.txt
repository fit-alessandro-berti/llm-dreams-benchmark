you feel an irresistible urge to touch it. The moment your fingers graze the surface, the canvas ripples like water and begins to absorb the colors around you. Swirls of molten gold, emerald green, and impossible shades not known in waking life flow from the sky into the blank space.

Shapes begin to emerge—first abstract, like fractured memories and forgotten emotions. Then, slowly, they coalesce into a scene: a forest of floating trees with glass bark and leaves that hum like wind chimes. A river of stars snakes through the roots, pulsing in time with your heartbeat.

As you step into the painting, the world folds around you like origami. You realize the landscape is responding to your thoughts. When you think of warmth, a sun blooms above. When you recall a song from childhood, the hills sing it back in harmonies whispered by the wind.

Then, in the distance, you see another figure—a version of yourself, cloaked in midnight blue, painting onto their own canvas. They turn toward you and smile as if they’ve been waiting.

They speak without sound:

**"What you create here will shape what you awaken to."**

And suddenly, you realize—this dream is a choice. What do you paint next?
