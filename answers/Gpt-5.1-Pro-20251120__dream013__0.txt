…as you move deeper into the maze, you notice the puzzles are changing.

At first, they were clear: sliding tiles, cryptic riddles, number sequences. You could track your progress with neat little victories, doors unlocking with satisfying clicks.

Now the walls start to narrow, and the next “puzzle” is simply a hallway with three doors. Each one looks identical—same brass handle, same wood, same faint scratch on the right side.

A plaque on the wall reads:

> **CHOOSE THE DOOR YOU ALREADY CHOSE.**

You haven’t been here before. At least, you don’t think so.

You try to reason it out. Maybe it's a trick: you’re supposed to realize that choosing any door will *become* the door you already chose. You place your hand on the middle one, more out of impatience than certainty, and turn the handle.

It opens.

On the other side is not another corridor, but a dimly lit study. Shelves lined with books stretch up beyond where the ceiling should be, disappearing into a faint, shifting darkness. A single desk lamp glows on an old wooden table. On the table: a half-completed jigsaw puzzle.

You approach it. The pieces are scattered, but something about them feels familiar. You pick one up. It’s printed with words instead of an image:

> “YOU WILL FORGET THIS.”

Another piece:

> “YOU HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE.”

You look at the puzzle box to see what you’re assembling. There is no picture. Just a single sentence where the picture should be:

> “THE SOLUTION IS REMEMBERING.”

You try to fit a few edge pieces together, but every time you place one, the image shifts. Words rearrange, lines overlap, and whole sections scramble. The more you try to force the pieces to fit, the more chaotic the puzzle becomes.

You stop. Take a breath. And *notice* something.

The pattern of words on the table isn’t random. It’s echoing your thoughts. When you think, *This makes no sense,* the phrase appears in tiny letters on one of the pieces. When you feel a spike of frustration, the word *ANGER* slides across the cardboard surface like a shadow.

You realize: the puzzle isn’t meant to be completed. It’s mirroring you.

You stand up, leaving the pieces as they are. As soon as you step away from the desk, a hidden mechanism clicks, and a bookshelf in the corner shifts aside, revealing another passage.

You don’t remember pulling any lever.

You step through.

The next chamber is a vast, circular room. The floor is a grid of glowing tiles, some lit, some dark. On the far wall, you see a phrase written in tall, blocky letters:

> **WALK ONLY ON TRUE STATEMENTS.**

Another line appears beneath it, letter by letter:

> “YOU ARE AWAKE.”

One tile near your foot flickers on with that sentence printed on it. You wait. Nothing happens. No traps, no disembodied voices, no hints. Just the challenge.

If you step on that tile and it’s false, something bad will happen. That much you’re certain of. Dreams may be strange, but they have rules—often ones you don’t realize you’re following.

You look around. Other tiles light up, one after another:

> “THIS IS A DREAM.”
> “YOU ARE SAFE.”
> “YOU ARE LOST.”
> “YOU HAVE CONTROL.”
> “YOU WILL NEVER GET OUT.”

You test a theory. You think, *This is definitely a dream.*

The tile that says “THIS IS A DREAM” burns brighter.

You step onto it.

The room hums, but the floor holds.

You take another step, choosing “YOU ARE SAFE.” You want it to be true. The tile glows warmly under your foot, and a distant sound like a lock turning echoes above you.

You continue. “YOU ARE LOST.” You hesitate… but in a way, you are. You step on it. The tile accepts you with a soft, pulsing light.

Above, segments of the ceiling begin to rearrange, forming a circular opening.

Now only two tiles in front of you remain lit:

> “YOU HAVE CONTROL.”
> “YOU WILL NEVER GET OUT.”

You feel the tug of fear at the second one. If you step on it, are you making it true? Or just acknowledging the fear? And what does it mean here, in a dream that already admitted itself?

You decide to test the boundary.

You say out loud, “I have some control, but not all.”

A tile to your left, previously dark, flares with that exact sentence. You step onto *that* one instead.

The entire floor lights up at once, every tile turning blank and white. The words vanish. The puzzle, apparently, is satisfied. The opening in the ceiling widens, and a staircase of light descends.

You climb.

As you rise, the maze starts to feel… thinner. Less solid. The walls you pass through aren’t quite vertical; they bend and flex, melting at the edges like mist pretending to be stone.

At the top of the stairs, you find a final room.

It is small. Simple. No clever mechanisms, no cryptic rules. Just a chair placed in front of a mirror.

You sit.

The mirror shows… you. Not exaggerated, not distorted. Just you, lit by a soft, sourceless glow. You wait for something dramatic: your reflection to move independently, or the glass to crack, or words to appear.

Instead, the reflection speaks in your voice.

“You know this is a dream,” it says. “So what are you still trying to solve?”

You open your mouth, but your reflection raises a hand.

“Every puzzle in the maze,” it continues, “kept asking you the same thing in different languages: *What do you believe is true about yourself right now?*”

Scenes flicker faintly in the mirror behind your reflected shoulders: the first riddles, the changing jigsaw, the glowing tiles with statements about you. They overlay one another like transparent pages.

“You solved them,” the reflection says, “by noticing, not by forcing. By admitting what was already true, even when it scared you.”

You feel something loosen in your chest. A tension you didn’t realize was there.

“And this,” your reflection says, “is the last puzzle.”

Words appear at the bottom of the mirror, as if typed by invisible hands:

> “TO EXIT THE MAZE, COMPLETE THE STATEMENT:
>
> ‘I AM…’”

You feel an instinctive urge to say something impressive or profound. *I am strong. I am in control. I am fearless.* But all of them feel like performances, like answers for someone else’s test.

You let those fall away and listen for the quiet, honest thing underneath.

When you finally speak, your voice is small, but steady.

“I am… trying,” you say. “And that’s enough for now.”

The mirror doesn’t flash or explode or rearrange itself. It just… softens. Your reflection smiles—your exact, ordinary smile.

The glass becomes transparent. On the other side isn’t another room, but a soft darkness that feels like the moment before waking, when everything is weightless and the world has not yet snapped back into place.

The maze behind you begins to fade, puzzles unbuilding themselves, corridors unwinding like thread. You feel the floor drop away, but you are not falling. You are simply… letting go.

Somewhere, very far away, you sense the shape of your own body lying still, eyes about to open.

In the last moment before the dream dissolves completely, you hear a final whisper, as if spoken right next to your ear:

“You can always come back, if you need to remember yourself again.”

And then the maze is gone.
