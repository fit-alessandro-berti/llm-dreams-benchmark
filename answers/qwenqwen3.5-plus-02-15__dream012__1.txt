You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you **realize the storm isn't coming from the sky, but rising from the depths.**

The waves aren't just water; they are shifting, translucent curtains of memory. As a massive swell crests above the mainmast, you see faces in the foam—old friends, lost loves, versions of yourself you left behind on distant shores. The thunder doesn't rumble; it whispers your name in a thousand different voices.

"Hold fast!" you shout, but your voice sounds like it's traveling through water. You grab the wheel, expecting the familiar rough wood, but your hands pass *through* it. The ship itself is dissolving into mist.

The crew isn't panicking anymore. They are standing still, eyes wide, watching as the deck beneath them turns into a mirror reflecting a starry night sky that shouldn't exist in the middle of a storm. You look down at your own boots and see they are standing on clouds.

"It's not a storm we must survive," you whisper, the fear suddenly replaced by a strange, weightless clarity. "It's a door we must walk through."

You step away from the phantom wheel and walk toward the bow. The rain stops falling upward. The wind holds its breath. You extend a hand to your first mate, who is no longer a sailor but a child holding a paper boat. Together, you step off the edge of the dissolving ship, not into the churning sea below, but into the quiet, golden silence of a waking morning, leaving the turbulence behind as nothing more than a fading dream within a dream.
