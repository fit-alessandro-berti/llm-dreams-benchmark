...grooves that seem to writhe and shift like slow-moving mercury under your fingertips. They aren't carved into the surface but seem to exist just beneath it, glowing with a faint, pulsating bioluminescence that matches the rhythm of your own heartbeat.

You realize the material isn't wood or metal; it feels cool and smooth like polished obsidian, yet it hums with a warmth that suggests it is alive. As you trace a particularly complex knot, the pattern clicks, sliding into alignment with a sound like a distant bell chiming underwater. The lock wasn't mechanical—it was waiting for your touch.

The lid lifts silently on its own. Inside, there is no bottom, only a swirling vortex of deep indigo mist that smells of ozone and rain on hot asphalt. A voice doesn't speak, but a thought pushes into your mind, clear and resonant: *You were never meant to open this. You were meant to remember it.*

You look into the abyss, and suddenly, the sensation of weight vanishes. The box dissolves into a flock of paper butterflies, and you find yourself not in a room, but falling gently upward into a sky filled with impossible, crescent-shaped moons, the mystery of the box replaced by the overwhelming feeling of déjà vu.
