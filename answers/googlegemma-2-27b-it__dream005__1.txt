...overhear snippets of conversation as I weave through the crowd.

A low rumble of laughter arose from a cluster of people gathered around a towering croquembouche, each tower glittering with sugared almonds and drizzled with golden caramel. It looked delicious, but I didn't dare approach.

Feeling a tap on my shoulder, I turn to see a man in a tux, looking strangely familiar, in the company of three impossibly tall women wearing variations of Viking helmets adorned with blinking Christmas lights. I strain to see better, hoping I recognize someone I can relate to in the sea of indistinguishable faces.

"Did I leave my beard in the mead hall?" I ask myself, eyebrows furrowed as I search for the owner of that tea-stained, chipped Viking helmet perched atop my head. It's surprisingly heavy for its size.

I scan the room, hoping to catch a glimpse of them through the throng. Unfortunately, my memories were hazy, the clatter of voices muddying my thoughts. The only thing I remembered clearly was feeling a curious mix of out of place and strangely empowered having a towering, albeit obscure, tower of cream puffs nestled between my insecurities and the strange buzzing sensation coming from the antennae on my helmet.


Where was I? And how did I get there? I couldn't quite place it, remember the route I’d taken through the crowd, giddy with the overwhelming details of the party swirling around me: the deafening sound of clinking glasses, duplicate conversations about the weather (which, oddly enough, felt more like a cacophony of ringing bells inside that bewildered, crowded space obscured by a sea of faces. Each conversation felt like it doubled or tripled in duplicates), the pungent aroma of smoke rising from the three women I passed, who were wearing diapers as a bizarre costume choice, and not the alluring jingle bell-clad warriors that the misconception typically portrays!

These women were of immense stature, at least three times my height, and each had a slightly different style. One wore a traditional Viking helmet with a wolf pelt edging. The woman with the braided horns, I realize with a jolt, is wearing one of them giant foam LEGO brick obstructors on their heads. While the other two women dressed as drinking Vikings arrive in warmer materials because, as Ulga the tallest (she was wearing a grizzly-sized helmet!!" She exclaims. "...I swear I've seen enough Viking helmets on children, even the one frozen and chiseled out of a block of ice was giggling at something I said. Or at least I think it was me I mean, sure, I can hear the sweet sounds of “New Valhalla” rotating predominantly, and being on "clashing horns, whooping chariot races, and loud, uncoordinated throat singing echoing throughout the room!"

She must have thought this was all some sort of cultural joke that went over my head. "Maybe I’ll be lucky, call it a night," I mutter to no one in particular, feelinng rather vulnerable. As I glance around, it hits me that not only is it the foundation of Liquor Store Dynamic






You see, the three Viking-helmeted women, a wall of green minifigures snarling through the twilight feast, are the key. I had to remember who they were, find the one with the intricate ironwork to the smallest bonfire at the center of the village "
