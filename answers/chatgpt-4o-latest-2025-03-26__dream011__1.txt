written in a language you don’t recognize. The letters twist and shift on the page, forming unfamiliar symbols that shimmer like reflections on water. Panic tightens in your chest—but as you look closer, the symbols begin to rearrange themselves, slowly taking the shape of words you *almost* understand.

Suddenly, a voice echoes from somewhere above, calm yet distant: “Answer only with your truth.”

You glance down. The exam page is now blank except for a single question: **"Who are you, without the answers?"**

The air around you feels heavy, the silence humming with tension. You try to write, but the pen floats just above the page, refusing to touch it until—you realize—you must *think*, not write. The words must come from somewhere deeper.

Images flood your mind: moments from your life, choices made and missed, dreams you never voiced, faces you’ve almost forgotten. Each image pulses like a heartbeat. Somehow, they *are* your answer.

As the images fade, the paper absorbs your thoughts. Your name appears at the top in glowing ink, and beneath it, just one word: **Becoming.**

The exam dissolves into light. You are no longer in a classroom but standing at a cliff’s edge, overlooking a vast landscape of shifting colors and infinite paths.

A soft wind carries a whisper: _“Your future is not given. It is written each time you wake.”_

And then—

You awaken.
