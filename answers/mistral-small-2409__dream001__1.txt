walk down the bustling street, the noise and commotion of the city surrounding you. The buildings are tall and ancient, with intricate carvings and signs that you can't quite read. You pull out your phone, but the screen is blank, no signal.

Suddenly, a small, hooded figure darts in front of you, nearly causing you to collide. They turn back and, to your surprise, hand you a small, worn pamphlet. On it is a map of the city, with a location circled in red ink. The figure whispers, "Your meeting is here," before disappearing into the crowd.

You look at the map, trying to orient yourself. The streets are a labyrinth, but you notice a peculiar pattern in the layout. The buildings seem to form a giant, intricate maze. You take a deep breath and start to navigate, hoping to reach your destination in time.

As you walk, the city begins to change. The buildings grow taller, more twisted, and the streets narrow. You hear distant whispers and echoes, as if the city itself is trying to communicate with you. You round a corner and come face to face with a massive clock tower. The clock's hands spin wildly, and you realize that time is running out.

You thank him and climb the creaky stairs, each step echoing in the quiet. At the top, you find a cozy room with a long table set for a meeting. As you sit down, the dream begins to shift again, and the room fades away...
