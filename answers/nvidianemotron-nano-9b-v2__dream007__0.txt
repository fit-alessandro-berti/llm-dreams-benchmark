You decide to pause, your breath catching as the weight of the words hangs between you. Suddenly, the room seems to shift—walls blur, and the argument dissolves into a cascade of memories: childhood laughter, shared secrets, moments you’d both forgotten. Your friend’s voice softens, not with anger, but with a quiet plea: *“What if we’re both wrong? What if this isn’t about the thing itself, but the fear of losing each other?”* The argument fades, replaced by a strange stillness. You realize the “important” issue was never the real problem—it was the unspoken truth that you’d both been holding back, afraid to admit you’d grown apart. In that moment, you both reach for each other, not to fight, but to rebuild. The dream ends with you two sitting in silence, the unspoken understanding now a bridge, not a barrier.
