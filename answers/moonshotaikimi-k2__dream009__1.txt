…learn what year it is before I starve or get myself hanged for witchcraft.

The ground beneath me is a quilt of moss and dew-cold pine needles, and when I push up onto my elbows the forest seems very tall, every trunk vanishing into silver morning mist. I’m still wearing the same T-shirt and jeans, but the phone in my pocket is dead—nothing but a black mirror when I press the button.

A hammering of hooves somewhere close. I duck behind a fallen log and watch a barefoot girl in a homespun dress dart past, eyes wild, leading a brown mule streaked with sweat. She’s hauling bundles of grain-sacks, and from the crest embroidered on the nearest bag I can just make out a yellow lion flanked by fleurs-de-lis. France, maybe? A hundred years ago? Three hundred? I should have paid more attention in European History.

When the path is clear I branch off, wind snagging my hair with resin-scented fingers. Sunlight glints on something metallic half buried in the soil: a pilgrim badge shaped like the scallop shell of Santiago. The edges are worn soft—a decade’s worth of roads? A century’s? Hard to guess, but the badge feels warm, as though it’s still breathing.

A briar snags my sleeve; threads rip like thoughts unfinished. No zipper, no velcro, no plastic. The snagged thread is proof I don’t belong here. I tuck the pilgrim badge into my pocket anyway—maybe it will buy me bread or mercy. On the far slope smoke unravels into the sky. I head toward it, picking up the rhythm of this new silence: no engines, no overhead wires, only birds practicing scales on invisible staves.

The village looks pinched from an illumination in some forgotten manuscript. Timber-framed houses with thatching so golden it hurts to look at in the sun. A stone church steeple stitching the sky. Wagons rattle past, iron rims grinding the dirt. The people eye me as if I’ve stepped out of a distortion in the air itself—my hair too short, my cuff strangely blue. One old man makes the sign of the Cross; a woman drops her basket of onions and bolts. Okay, probably not sixteenth-century tolerance.

I smell baking—hearth-bread and onions, sharp and honest—and my stomach answers with a growl louder than any bell tower. In my pocket the pilgrim badge is searing hot again, almost pulsing. I close my fist around it and remember the stories they used to tell of St. James appearing exactly when travelers were about to give up.

Bread first. Answers second. Then—if I’m lucky—a road.

I smooth my hair into the closest thing to a respectable knot and step onto the rutted lane, practicing the lie that has already formed on my tongue: “Good folk, I’ve come far from Compostella, and I bear a message sealed by the Apostle himself.”
