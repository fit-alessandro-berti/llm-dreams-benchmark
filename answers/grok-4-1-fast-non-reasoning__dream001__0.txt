You start to wander the labyrinthine streets, neon lights flickering like fireflies in a perpetual twilight. Towering spires of glass and chrome pierce the smoggy sky, their surfaces crawling with holographic ads that whisper promises in languages you half-recognize. Panic bubbles up—your phone's dead, no maps, no contacts—but then a sleek black cab materializes from the fog, its door swinging open invitingly.

You slide in, heart pounding, and rasp the address you somehow remember: "The Apex Tower, penthouse level." The driver, a shadowy figure with glowing eyes in the rearview, nods silently and guns the engine. The city blurs into streaks of color—flying drones, street vendors hawking glowing fruits, crowds of masked revelers parting like water.

Minutes tick by in surreal slow-motion. The cab weaves through impossible shortcuts, defying gravity up sheer walls, until it deposits you at the foot of the Apex: a monolithic needle pulsing with inner light. Elevators hum you skyward, floors dissolving into infinity.

The penthouse doors iris open to reveal... not a boardroom, but a vast chamber floating among stars. Figures in iridescent suits await, their faces shifting like oil on water. "You're late," one smiles, extending a hand that morphs into keys to the city. "But dreams don't run on time."

You reach out—and jolt awake, the alarm blaring. The city fades, but the keys? They're still clutched in your fist.
