...written in a language you’ve never seen before—curving glyphs that shimmer like oil on water, shifting slightly every time you blink. Panic claws at your throat. *This isn’t just unknown—it’s impossible.*  

You glance around the exam hall. Rows of students scribble furiously, their pens moving with eerie synchronicity. Their papers glow faintly, but yours remains stubbornly blank. Then you remember: *This isn’t your first time.* Fragments of other dreams flash—sitting here before, failing, restarting, trapped in a loop.  

A cold whisper brushes your ear: **"The questions aren’t written *on* the page… they’re written *by* you."**  

You look down. Your own hand is trembling, pen hovering. The blank page seems to pulse, waiting. With a shaky breath, you press the pen to paper—and the ink flows not in words, but in memories: your childhood fear of thunderstorms, the taste of your grandmother’s tea, the way your best friend laughed when you tripped over nothing last summer. The glyphs rearrange themselves, translating your life into symbols.  

Suddenly, you understand. The exam isn’t testing knowledge. It’s testing *authenticity*. The career it decides isn’t one you *choose*… it’s the one your soul has already lived.  

You write your truth without stopping. The room dissolves into starlight.  

When you wake, your palm is pressed to your chest, and for the first time, you know exactly what you’re meant to do.  

*(The dream ends. You’re still holding the pen.)*
