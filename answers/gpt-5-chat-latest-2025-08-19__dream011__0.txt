...not written in words at all, but instead appear as shifting images that ripple across the page like reflections on water. You lean closer, trying to discern them: landscapes, constellations, faces you almost recognize but can’t fully name. The more you stare, the more the images twist themselves into questions, but questions that don’t have clear answers.  

One page asks you to trace the path of a bird you’ve never seen before, its wings drawn with lines of light that vanish if you stop watching. Another page shows you a door, and you have to decide whether opening it would count as a "correct response." Every choice feels both trivial and enormous, as if your life will tilt in one direction or another depending on a flick of your pencil.  

Students around you scribble furiously, though you hear no sound—just the scraping of pens that leave no marks. The silence in the room grows heavy. You glance at the clock, only to find its hands spinning backwards.   

Then you realize: the exam is less about answering questions and more about whether you can *remain calm* in the strangeness of it. The test is not knowledge, but presence.  

As you understand this, the papers turn blank in your hands, and the professor at the front looks up, their face dissolving into a mirror reflecting *you*.  

Would you like me to continue into what happens **after you finish the exam**, or deepen this surreal exam scene further?
