—you look down to find your keyboard has been replaced with a plate of spaghetti. Your computer monitor flickers and transforms into a massive digital hourglass, sand rushing down at a frightening pace. Your boss keeps staring but his face is blurry, unreadable, almost melting at the edges.

You try to type, but each noodle squishes messily between your fingers. The screen displays strange shapes instead of words—letters morphing into birds, fluttering away before you can grab them. You think, **“I need help!”** but the only sound that comes out of your mouth is the ringing of a telephone. Nobody answers.

Suddenly, the office walls stretch upward, blue sky visible where the ceiling was. Your coworkers float by, seated at their desks, waving as they drift past wearing parachutes made from spreadsheets. There is so much to do, but everything you try only gets stranger: your to-do list grows legs and scurries away, the clock spins backward, and your chair starts spinning, lifting you gently into the sky—free at last from deadlines, floating toward the sun.
