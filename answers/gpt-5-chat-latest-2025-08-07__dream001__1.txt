…wander through the streets, their cobblestones slick and glistening as though it had just rained, though the air is dry. Buildings loom impossibly tall, their windows shifting like eyes. The signs on the corners are written in letters you almost understand—if you squint, they seem to rearrange themselves into words you recognize, then slide into nonsense again.

You keep walking, trying to catch someone’s gaze to ask for directions, but the faces in the crowd blur and smear like wet paint. Every time you focus on someone, they turn away and vanish down an alley you swear wasn’t there before. The sound of your own footsteps starts to echo unnaturally, overlapping, as if there’s another version of you ahead — or behind — walking in sync.

A clock tower rises in the distance, its hands spinning wildly, yet you feel the seconds bleeding away. You check your pockets for a phone or map, but instead you find a small paper card with your name on it…and beneath it, a single word: “*Ascend*.”

You look up. A narrow spiraling staircase now juts from the side of a nearby building, climbing high into a bank of swirling, silver clouds. Without knowing why, you start to ascend.

Would you like me to continue this dream into something *lucid* and give you control over where it goes next?
