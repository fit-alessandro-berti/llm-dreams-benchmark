feel a warmth spread through your chest. They push back a curtain of noise and point — not at a map, but at small, simple things: a cafe that smells like cinnamon and rain; a narrow stair spiraling up between brick walls where laughter spills out like light; a sign in a language you don't quite know that somehow reads your name. One of them presses a folded paper into your hand. It's blank at first, then ink blooms across it: directions written in quiet, ordinary verbs — breathe, pause, listen — and you realize the path they offer isn't marked by streets but by choices.

They walk with you, not ahead like guides but beside you like companions. Each stranger is different: one hums a tune that rearranges the echo of your footsteps; another untangles a knot in your scarf and speaks of the small detours that are really shortcuts. You pass a market where vendors trade memories instead of goods; you barter a small, stubborn worry for a warm cup of tea and it dissolves on your tongue. The city shifts as you move through it — alleys lengthen, lampposts tilt closer — as if the place itself is making room for the path you're creating together.

At the heart of a courtyard, they stop. A single tree grows out of the cobblestones, leaves rustling like pages. Someone climbs up and shakes down a handful of paper lanterns; they light and hang themselves on the branches, each lantern holding a soft, private promise you've been too afraid to speak aloud. You find yourself saying one anyway, and when you do, the city answers: a door opens that you'd never noticed, and behind it is a narrow room full of faces that look like yours at different times — a child with uncut hair, an older you with softer shoulders — all smiling. It isn't a map to a place but a map of time.

When you finally step through, the strangers step back into the flow of the city, their hands lingering for a moment against your arm. They don't tell you where to go next. Instead, they leave you with a small compass that points not north but to the things that make your pulse steady. You put it in your pocket, the metal warm, and for the first time in a long while you know the difference between being lost and being on the cusp of an arrival. The city hums around you — vast, complicated, alive — and you walk on, less alone, following a light that feels, inexplicably, like home.
