You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching, and the air grows thick with the scent of damp earth and ozone. The canopy above, once a mosaic of dappled sunlight, begins to thrash as a cold wind tears through the trees.

You quicken your pace, looking for shelter. The first heavy drops strike your shoulders, cold and startling. Then, the sky cracks open—not with a flash of lightning, but with a deep, resonant sound, like a giant crystal bell being struck. The rain doesn't fall; it *hangs*, each droplet shimmering and suspended in the air around you.

Time seems to stretch. A deer steps onto the path ahead, its coat dry, its eyes holding a knowing, ancient light. It bows its head, and in the space between heartbeats, you understand its silent question: *"Which path will you choose—the one of memory, or the one of becoming?"*

Before you can answer, the suspended rain coalesces into a shimmering archway. Through it, you see not the forest, but the cozy, sunlit kitchen of your childhood home. The scent of baking bread wafts out, warm and comforting.

The other path, revealed by the deer's fading silhouette, leads deeper into the storm-washed woods, glowing with bioluminescent fungi and the electric charge of the unknown.

You stand at the crossroads, the dream holding its breath, waiting for your decision.
