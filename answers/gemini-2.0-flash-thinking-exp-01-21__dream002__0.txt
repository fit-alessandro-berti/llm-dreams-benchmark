... and a deep, low rumble echoes through the trees, vibrating in your chest. The air, once still and warm, turns heavy and carries the scent of damp earth and ozone. A sudden gust of wind whips through the canopy above, making the leaves chatter and dance like panicked whispers.

You glance upwards.  The cheerful blue sky is rapidly being devoured by bruised, purple clouds that churn and swirl with an unsettling energy.  The light in the forest shifts, becoming dimmer and more ominous, casting long, distorted shadows that stretch and writhe like living things.

A single, fat raindrop splatters on your cheek, cold and sharp.  Then another, and another, quickly escalating into a heavy patter that drums on the leaves above, creating a rushing, whispering sound that drowns out the peaceful birdsong from moments before.

Fear, sharp and primal, prickles your skin.  You quicken your pace, your heart beginning to pound against your ribs.  Instinct screams at you to find shelter. You scan the trees, hoping for a hollow log or a rocky overhang, anything to escape the impending downpour.

The wind howls now, a mournful, rising cry that tears through the branches.  Leaves are ripped from their moorings and swirl around you in a chaotic dance.  The forest, moments ago serene and welcoming, has transformed into a wild, untamed beast, thrashing and roaring in its sudden fury.

Suddenly, a flash of brilliant white light illuminates the forest, followed almost instantly by a deafening CRACK of thunder that reverberates through the very ground beneath your feet.  You flinch, your senses overwhelmed.

And then, the heavens truly open. The rain becomes a torrential downpour, a blinding sheet of water that soaks you to the bone in seconds.  Visibility drops to near zero.  You can barely see a few feet in front of you, the trees dissolving into blurry, rain-streaked shapes.

Desperation claws at you. You stumble blindly forward, pushing through the whipping branches, your clothes clinging to you like lead weights.  The forest floor is quickly turning to mud, slick and treacherous underfoot.

You cry out, a wordless sound lost in the roar of the storm, a desperate plea for safety, for escape from this sudden, terrifying transformation of your peaceful dream.  And as you run, you can’t shake the feeling that the storm isn’t just outside you, it’s somehow… **inside you too, mirroring a sudden turmoil rising within your own dream-self.**
