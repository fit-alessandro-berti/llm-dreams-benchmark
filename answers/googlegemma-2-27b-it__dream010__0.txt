...as the competition progressed, each task felt less like a trial and more like a whispered directive from the universe itself. I was driven, fuelled by a burning desire to win.

We started with a seemingly absurd test – building the tallest tower out of marshmallows and dried spaghetti. I knew this wasn't gonna land me a corner office CEO job; it felt more like something society deemed "unproductive" yet oddly satisfyingly classic for a corporate setting. 

I felt a surge of childish glee as I meticulously constructed my masterpiece alongside seven other finalists. It was oddly therapeutic: the puffy white marshmallows radiating under the fluorescent lights, the precarious spaghetti towers reaching for the sky, all to a cheerful jingle playing over the sound system instead of the tense, dramatic music I'd come to expect from these "dream job" competition romances we always see in movies.

It was my dream job, though. Not the typical one most would expect, but my design background had always been more brick-and-mortar than building castles out of carbohydrates.

So, I focused, discarding the pre-teen cliché and arrogantly sizing up the competition. There was Olivia, the pottery whiz who made mugs that predicted your future based on the tea leaves they held; Ben, the aspiring baker who presented edible sculptures of Edwardian pastries (don't ask); and Chloe, the fidgety artist who insisted her creations were works of "edible art".  

My nemesis, a prickly woman with a perfectly asymmetrical bob and critique-widows-peaking glasses perched precariously on her nose, smiled tightly, her hand mimicking the spirograph patterns right there in the video editing room?  Wait, why was there a spirograph machine?  Why are we making blogs, not businesses? It didn't matter. My design for an exploding oven mitt cake stand held a silent, artistic promise of a delicious victory.

But the real challenge lay ahead. The aroma of burnt sugar and anticipation hung in the air – a strange, intoxicating combination, like the smell of fast-approaching failure (in a very literal, albeit fragrant, floral-print-blackened-doughnuts sort of way) and Potentially-Successful-Pastry-Chef-Have-You-Considered-The-Cake. This was the final round, and the three judges were leaning over their desks, their faces illuminated by the screen of their very own computer game: "The Creative Chef".

The challenges escalated, of course. Building a successful Eiffel Tower?spilled managera basket weaving competition, but with the stakes raised high. A whole series of culinary cribbage games became "Is This a Nailed-It? Moment" and we had to explain why a dish was good, not dating-show-caliber-but-good. Building the most impressive gingerbread house I'd ever seen was deemed a necessary "pre-game move".

My cooking prowess was…unconventional. My forte was plumbing. I knew the best ways to fix leaky faucets and disastrous drains. But to face-off against-"Bake-Off" Ben, the notorious "Edible Master"? That should be interesting.

**And so the final challenge began.  

We were given the task of designing a dessert that encapsulated the spirit of each other's profession.** We had to work together, the ultimate culinary-creation nightmare, considering we all knew this intentional "disaster" route was programmed for maximum destruction.**

Our final challenge is to design a dessert inspired by the dreams of another person. Dusting off my pastry-spatula-wielding competitor's mind set, Divine Creation Desserts hired a "special consultant", a celebrated chef with boundless creativity. Saying "there are no guaranteed winning techniques" he said "we can work with flavors that resonate with their dreamscape".


The other competitors, "there was no hesitation" and "Sweets for the Sweetmaker," looked at me with wary eyes. This competition was fierce.** What did they think distracted by an errant tsp of vanilla extract hiding in my pantry?

"Let's get cookin'," said my collaborator, pulling out a carton of slightly burnt sugar cookies.

“Isn’t that a bit…” I trailed off, looking at the flour-dusted notepad clutched in your hand.  
 
“Trust me,” he scoffed, "on this path to a Michelin-star future, cats sniff at the concepts of sweetness and measurement.

But there’s another

 **The Catch:** The irony that I had a digital computer-aided dream board in my hands.

I’d never look so locked in on a traditional metal enclosure for a magnum-sized masterpiece of a costumed confectioner!

What happens next? 

It was my turn again. A small part of me resented Abbaddon. "This doesn't sound like a metaphorical cake,” I said, trying to hide a smirk.

The other contestants just turned to look at us, their eyes filled with curiosity, confusion, and – was that a smirk on the chef’s face? I’d say, hold on to your hats, jams, and preserves
