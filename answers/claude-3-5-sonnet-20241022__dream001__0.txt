Let me continue this dream scenario:

You start to frantically search through your pockets, finding only a mysterious business card that keeps changing its text every time you look at it. The city around you seems to shift and morph - buildings stretch impossibly tall, then shrink again, while streets curve in ways that defy geometry.

Determined to find your way, you ask a passing stranger for directions, but when they turn to face you, their features are constantly swirling like watercolors. They point in three different directions simultaneously with six different arms that fade in and out of existence.

You check your phone for help, but the screen shows a map that looks like a maze designed by M.C. Escher - staircases leading to nowhere and paths that loop back on themselves impossibly. The time on your phone keeps jumping between 2:15 and 7:43, neither of which seems to be the correct time.

As anxiety builds, you notice your footsteps are leaving glowing footprints that rise up and float away like luminous butterflies. You have a sudden, inexplicable certainty that if you could just follow the right butterfly, it would lead you to your destination...

Care to hear what happens next in this dream?
