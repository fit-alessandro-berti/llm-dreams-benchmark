accept their help, grateful but cautious. They lead you down narrow, winding alleyways that somehow feel more open and alive than the crowded streets you left behind. Bright murals light up the cracked walls, and the air smells like spices and rain.

One of the strangers, an old woman with silver hair woven into intricate braids, hands you a small, glowing compass. "This city listens," she says, her voice like music. "But you must ask the right questions."

You hold the compass, feeling its warmth in your palm. It doesn't point north — it points toward something deeper, something you're only beginning to understand. As you follow its pull, the strangers fade into the crowd, smiling, leaving you with a sense that you are not as lost as you thought.

You turn a corner, and suddenly the city transforms — skyscrapers twist into towering trees, and the concrete under your feet becomes soft moss. The compass glows brighter, urging you forward into a new world hidden just beneath the one you knew.

Would you like me to keep going?
