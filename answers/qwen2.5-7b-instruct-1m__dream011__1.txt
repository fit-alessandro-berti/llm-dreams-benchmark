different from anything you've ever encountered before. Instead of traditional multiple-choice or essay questions, the exam is presented as a series of interactive scenarios. Each question unfolds like a mini-mystery, requiring you to make decisions that affect the outcome.

The room feels unusually quiet, save for the soft hum of an unseen presence. You can feel the weight of anticipation, but also a strange sense of calm. The instructions at the top of the page read:

**"Your journey here is not just about answering questions correctly; it's about understanding how your choices shape your path. Every decision you make will lead you toward one of three possible futures: a career in technology, a career in the arts, or a career in education."**

You take a deep breath and begin.

### **Question 1:**

You wake up in a dimly lit room, disoriented. On the table in front of you is a laptop, a cup of coffee, and a stack of papers. You feel a sense of urgency, but also a growing unease. The screen of the laptop is flickering, displaying a single message:

**"Welcome to the beginning of your journey."**

The cursor blinks, waiting for input.

What do you do?

A) Open the laptop and start typing the first question of the exam.

B) Check the time on your watch and decide if you should panic.

C) Look around the room for any clues—maybe there’s something hidden in plain sight.

D) Take a sip of coffee and try to gather your thoughts.
