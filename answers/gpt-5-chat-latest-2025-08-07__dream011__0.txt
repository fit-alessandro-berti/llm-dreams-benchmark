…written in a language you’ve never seen before. The letters shift and shimmer as you try to focus, rearranging themselves into strange symbols that almost resemble human faces—some smiling warmly, others frowning in disapproval.

You glance around the exam hall. The other students are writing furiously, their pens scratching like tiny mouse claws against the paper. But when you lean over to peek at your neighbor’s work, their page is completely blank. Still, they keep writing as if filling invisible lines with words that only they can see.

A faint hum begins to vibrate through the room, coming from the ceiling vents. It grows steadier, almost like a voice whispering directly into your thoughts: *“You already know the answers. You just have to remember.”*

When you look down again, the pages are no longer covered in symbols but in vivid images—snapshots from your own life, moments you hadn’t thought of in years: your childhood bedroom, the park where you first learned to ride a bike, the shadowy corner of your grandmother’s attic. At the bottom of the page, a final instruction is written in a bold, unwavering hand:

**“Circle the one thing you would keep when everything else is gone.”**

Your hand hovers above the paper. The images seem to pulse with life—almost as if they’re waiting for your choice.

Would you like me to continue this dream and carry you through your choice, or would you prefer to see where it goes if you refuse to make it?
