feel the weight of their expectations pressing heavily on your shoulders. The wind howls like a wild beast, and the waves rise like towering walls of water, threatening to engulf your ship. Your hands grip the ship's wheel tightly, knuckles white, as you shout commands to your crew.

"Hold steady! Secure the sails! Prepare to brace for impact!"

Lightning illuminates the darkened sky, briefly revealing the terrified but resolute faces of your crew. You take a deep breath, steadying your mind amidst the chaos. You recall the stories of captains who’ve faced storms like this and wonder if the sea will grant you safe passage—if you can be one of them.

Suddenly, a strange, glowing light pierces through the storm clouds. The light seems to pulse, drawing your attention and silencing the deafening roar of the storm for just a moment. Your first mate, an old sailor with a face carved by years of salt and wind, shouts over the noise, "Captain, look! It’s coming from the east!"

Guided more by instinct than reason, you turn the wheel toward the light. The crew hesitates, murmuring among themselves, unsure if this unknown beacon is a blessing or a curse. A melodic, unearthly song seeps through the wind, both soothing and eerily disconcerting.

As the ship approaches the source of the light, the waves begin to calm. The storm seems to part around you, the ferocity dwindling to an almost impossible serenity. The glowing light intensifies, and you can now make out its source—a massive, otherworldly structure rising from the sea itself, carved from silvery stone and adorned with intricate patterns that seem to shift and change as you look at them.

What do you do next?
