dark clouds swirl above, casting eerie shadows across the forest floor. The wind picks up, rustling the leaves like whispers all around you. A distant rumble of thunder vibrates through the trees.

You quicken your pace, searching for shelter, when a flash of lightning illuminates something unusual—a narrow stone archway nestled between two ancient oak trees. It wasn’t there before.

Compelled by curiosity, you step closer. As you pass through the archway, the storm’s roar fades into silence. The moment you emerge on the other side, you find yourself in an entirely different place—a vast, moonlit meadow stretching endlessly before you.

Above, the sky is filled not with storm clouds, but with stars more vivid than you’ve ever seen. Some of them seem to move, shifting their positions as if aware of your arrival. Then, you notice something glowing in the distance. A lone figure, dressed in shimmering silver robes, stands waiting for you.

They raise a hand in greeting and speak your name, though you’ve never met them before.

What do you do?
