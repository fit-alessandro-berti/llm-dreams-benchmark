…dark clouds swirl overhead, blotting out the sunlight so completely that the forest around you fades into a dim, green twilight. The gentle whisper of leaves you heard moments ago is replaced by anxious rustling, as if every tree is holding its breath. The air thickens, heavy with moisture, and a sharp scent of ozone pricks at your nostrils.

As you continue forward, the path beneath your feet grows uneven. Gnarled roots jut upward, forcing you to slow and watch your step. The wind begins to howl—not just rush through the trees, but truly howl, as if a creature you cannot see is raging at the sky. The leaves dance in frantic spirals around your ankles, and the temperature drops, making you shiver despite the moisture on your skin.

Lightning flashes in the distance. Not the bright white bolts you’re used to, but arcs of deep violet and indigo that split the darkness. Each flash illuminates the forest floor, revealing shapes you hadn’t noticed before: smooth stones arranged in odd patterns, twisted vines that form knots resembling letters of an unknown language. You feel a kind of urgency now. You don’t know why, but there’s a message hidden in these patterns—or at least, that’s what your dream logic suggests. If only you could decode it, perhaps you’d find shelter before the storm breaks.

Thunder booms overhead, and the sound reverberates through your chest. You pick up the pace, pushing through ferns that cling to your clothing, trying to slow you. Ahead, you think you see a break in the trees—maybe a clearing. The storm’s fury intensifies as you rush toward it. The rain begins with stinging droplets that feel almost like tiny hailstones, and the wind whips the branches so fiercely they scrape at your arms.

When you emerge into the clearing, you realize it’s not truly open; it’s more like a ring of ancient oaks, each bent inward as if they are bowing to something at the center. There, in the middle of the circle, stands a moss-covered stone altar. The violet lightning crackles directly overhead, and suddenly you sense eyes on you. Not human eyes, but something older, watching from above or below, peering through the veil of rain.

You draw closer to the altar, the storm raging in a crescendo of noise and flashing light. Your heart pounds. On its surface, etched into the stone, are spirals and runes similar to the patterns you saw on the forest floor. You reach out, running your fingertips along the cold, wet surface, and as you do, the wind seems to hush, just for a moment. There’s a hollow silence—a bubble of calm in the chaos. In that silence, you understand without words: the forest wants you to listen, to understand the old language of the earth and the sky.

Just as you lean in, just as you think you might hear that voice of the forest’s heart, a blinding flash of lightning strikes the altar, and a thunderclap rattles your teeth. The altar splits, moss and stone crumbling apart. The runes glow briefly, fiercely, and then fade. In that instant, you sense a choice: stay and unravel the meaning behind this secret language and risk being caught in the heart of the storm, or turn and flee back into the darkness of the forest, uncertain and unknowing.

Your breath catches. You raise your eyes to the swirling canopy, and the next step you take will decide your fate.
