…you sit down at your desk, but the computer screen is blank, just a faint glow. The project brief is written on a paper that keeps folding itself into a paper airplane and flying away. Your boss stares, tapping their foot, and the tapping gets louder until it echoes like a ticking clock. You reach for the keyboard, but the keys melt under your fingers, turning into tiny puddles of ink that float up and form words in the air. The office walls dissolve into a vast ocean, and your desk is suddenly a raft bobbing in the middle of it. You realize the “project” is actually a giant, shimmering blueprint floating above the water, and the deadline is a storm cloud racing toward you. 

Panicked, you try to swim toward the blueprint, but as you do, you find you can just think the pieces into place. With each thought, the storm cloud slows, and the boss—now perched on a nearby lighthouse—nods approvingly. Just as the last piece snaps into place, the ocean turns into a carpet, the lighthouse shrinks into a desk lamp, and you hear your alarm clock ringing, pulling you out of the dream.
