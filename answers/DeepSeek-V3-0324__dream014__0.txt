...feel a wave of relief wash over you. Their warm smiles and reassuring words make the overwhelming city feel a little less intimidating. One of them, a woman with gentle eyes, hands you a small, intricately folded paper crane.  

*"Follow us,"* she says, *"and trust the path."*  

As you walk together, the chaotic streets begin to shift—neon signs blur into glowing fireflies, and the pavement softens beneath your feet, turning into a winding forest path. The strangers guide you effortlessly, their laughter light and familiar, as if you’ve known them for years.  

Then, just as you reach a sunlit clearing, you realize—you’re no longer lost. You’re exactly where you’re meant to be.  

And then... you wake up.  

Would you like to explore the meaning of this dream, or continue the story in another direction?
