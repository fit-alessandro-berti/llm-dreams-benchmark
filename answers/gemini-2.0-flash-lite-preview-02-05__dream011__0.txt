...written in a language I've never seen before. It's a swirling, glyph-filled script, almost like ancient hieroglyphs, but with a fluidity and complexity that makes my brain ache just looking at it. Each character seems to shift and shimmer in the fluorescent light of the sterile classroom. I can't even begin to identify any recognizable patterns. My heart leaps into my throat and hammers against my ribs.

Panic claws at my throat. I look around the room, desperate for some reassurance, but everyone else seems perfectly calm, already scribbling furiously on their papers. They're probably fluent in this alien language, these smug, competent future-professionals. I feel utterly, completely alone.

I try to focus, to remember anything from the lectures, from the study sessions... but my mind is a blank, echoing cavern.
