…and each new trial feels less like a normal contest and more like a surreal test of who you truly are.

1. The Hall of Locked Doors  
A silver-haired usher leads you into a circular room whose walls are lined with dozens of identical wooden doors. A booming voice explains that only one door opens to the next round; the rest loop you back here, erasing five minutes from the countdown clock floating above your head.  
You close your eyes, trying to hear something—anything—behind the doors. Faintly, behind one, you recognize a fragment of your favorite song from childhood. You choose it. The door glides open to reveal…

2. The Library of Lost Questions  
Shelves stretch upward into darkness, filled not with books but with glowing question marks. Each question you pull down becomes audible: “What would you do if nobody applauded?” “Would you take a shortcut if no one found out?”  
You must answer three truthfully while six masked judges listen from the shadows. You speak without hesitation, and after the third answer the masks nod as if satisfied. A staircase of floating index cards materializes, spiraling upward.

3. The Bridge of Shrinking Planks  
At the top you step onto a suspended bridge. Every footstep makes the plank behind you vanish. Midway, a storm whips in, the rope rails thrashing. Below, instead of a ravine, you see snapshots of alternate futures—versions of yourself who quit, who settled, who never dared apply.  
Your heart pounds, but you keep moving forward, speaking aloud the mission statement you wrote the night before the competition. The wind calms; the final plank stretches into solid ground.

4. The Interview with Yourself  
You enter a glass cube. Across the table sits… you, wearing the outfit you imagine you’ll have on your first day at your dream job. This double asks the hardest interview questions you’ve ever heard, finishing with: “Convince me that our life’s purpose is worth the risk.”  
You realize the answer isn’t verbal. You slide your résumé aside, place your palm over your own heart, and simply breathe. The cube fills with warm light. Your double smiles, stands, and merges with you like mist.

5. The Rooftop Finish Line  
A single spotlight reveals a red button on a pedestal. Pressing it will end the competition, but printed beneath in glowing letters is: “Or jump.” Confused, you glance over the edge. Instead of a drop, you see clouds swirling into a staircase of light that climbs beyond sight.  
You understand: the button guarantees the job; the leap promises something greater but undefined. Trusting the dream’s logic, you step onto the clouds. They solidify under your feet. Trumpets sound in the distance.

You awaken in your bed just as your alarm rings. On your phone is an email time-stamped 3:03 a.m.—an invitation to interview for the exact position you dreamed of, with the subject line: “Ready to take the next step?”
