...keep moving forward, determined to find signs of hope amid the ruins. The sky above is a muted gray, thick with ash and memory. You scavenge for food in the hollowed-out shell of a convenience store, the shelves barren except for a single can of beans and a weathered photograph of a family you do not know.

As you step outside, the wind bites at your skin, but you wrap your coat tighter and set off toward the rumble of distant voices. Your footsteps echo on cracked pavement as you skirt the skeletal remains of abandoned cars. Every so often, you notice other survivors lurking at the edges of your vision—eyes wary, hands gripping makeshift weapons.

You decide to try to trust, just once, and approach a small group gathered around a barely smoldering fire. They look up, surprise and suspicion mingling in their expressions. You clear your throat, offering the can of beans as a peace offering.

A moment of silence follows, then a woman with a scarred cheek nods and motions for you to sit. The warmth of the fire and the cautious camaraderie feel almost strange after so much solitude. Someone offers you a spoonful of watery soup, and for the first time in longer than you can remember, you let your guard fall just a little.

In the flickering light, hope seems possible again, fragile but real. This world may be broken, but together, you think, maybe you can rebuild something worth dreaming about.
