feel a strange mix of excitement and nervousness bubbling up inside you. The spotlight is warm on your skin, but it also feels like all the air has been sucked out of the room. You take a deep breath, gripping the edges of the podium in front of you for support.

As you open your mouth to speak, something unexpected happens—the microphone emits a loud, high-pitched squeal that echoes through the auditorium. The crowd winces collectively, and you can't help but chuckle nervously. "Well," you say with an awkward smile, "at least we know the mic works."

But then, as you glance down at your notes, they suddenly seem to shimmer and shift under the bright lights. The words are no longer there; instead, the pages have transformed into something else entirely—images of places you've never seen before, swirling patterns that almost look alive. Your heart skips a beat as you realize this isn’t just stage fright playing tricks on you. This is... different.

The audience begins murmuring among themselves, their faces flickering between confusion and curiosity. Some people point toward the stage, whispering excitedly. It dawns on you that they must be seeing *something* too—something extraordinary happening around you. 

You lift your head again, scanning the sea of eyes staring back at you. But now, everything seems sharper, clearer, more vivid than before. Colors pulse faintly in the corners of your vision, and you notice tiny motes of light floating lazily through the air, like fireflies trapped indoors. A gentle hum fills the space, resonating in your chest, syncing perfectly with the rhythm of your heartbeat.

And then it hits you: this moment isn’t about giving a speech anymore. Somehow, you’ve stepped into something far bigger—a dream within a dream, perhaps, or maybe even a glimpse of another reality layered over this one. Whatever it is, the energy in the room has shifted completely. The crowd isn’t waiting for words from you—they’re waiting for *magic*. 

Your palms tingle, and when you raise your hands slightly, trails of golden light follow their movements, painting ephemeral streaks across the air. Gasps ripple through the audience, followed by awestruck silence. You don’t fully understand what’s happening, but you feel instinctively connected to it—as if some dormant part of yourself has awakened.

With newfound confidence, you step away from the podium, letting your feet carry you closer to the edge of the stage. The lights above dim further, casting the room into a soft twilight glow. Each step you take leaves faint imprints of light behind, glowing softly against the dark wood of the stage floor. 

One person in the front row—a young girl with wide, curious eyes—reaches out hesitantly toward you. Her fingers brush against the edge of the stage, and where her hand touches, flowers bloom instantly, climbing upward like vines seeking sunlight. She gasps, pulling her hand back, but her expression quickly shifts to wonder. Others in the audience begin reaching out too, trying to touch the same spot, hoping to spark the same miracle.

A laugh escapes your lips—not out of mockery, but pure joy. For the first time, you feel truly unburdened, untethered from doubt or fear. Whatever power this is, it flows effortlessly through you, connecting you to everyone and everything in the room. And though you still don’t know exactly what’s going on, one thing becomes crystal clear:

This isn’t your dream—it’s theirs. And you’re here to guide them through it.
