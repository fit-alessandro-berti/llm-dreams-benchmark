...sit down at your desk, but as you reach for the keyboard, your hands feel heavy and swollen, like you are wearing thick winter mittens. You try to type, but your fingers are massive, soft sausages that only manage to mash all the keys at once, creating a long, solid tone of error beeps.

You look up to explain the delay, but your boss isn't looking at your face. They are staring at your feet. You glance down and realize with a jolt of panic that you aren't wearing shoes—or pants. You are somehow wearing your childhood pajamas, the ones with the ducks on them.

The boss opens their mouth to speak, but instead of words, a loud, distorted foghorn sound echoes through the room, shaking the fluorescent lights until they swing wildly. You try to stand up to run, but your legs are stuck in place, as if the floor has turned to quick-setting cement. You look at the clock on the wall to see how much time is left, but the numbers aren't numbers anymore—they are falling off the face of the clock like black raindrops, splattering onto your desk. Suddenly, the walls of the office dissolve into mist, revealing that you are actually standing in the middle of a grocery store aisle, holding a single, dripping carton of milk, while a giant, silent hamster watches you from the top of a shelf.
