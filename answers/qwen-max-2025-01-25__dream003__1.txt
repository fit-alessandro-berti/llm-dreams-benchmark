symbols etched into its surface, glowing faintly under the dim light. The patterns seem to shift and writhe as if alive, whispering secrets in a language you can almost understand. You feel an inexplicable pull toward the box, as though it holds something vital—something that belongs to you.

As your fingers brush against the cold metal, the symbols flare brighter, and the air around you grows heavy with anticipation. A low hum begins to resonate from within the box, vibrating through your chest. Suddenly, you hear a voice—not with your ears but inside your mind. It speaks in fragments, cryptic yet urgent:

*"The key... is not what it seems. Look beyond the veil..."*

Confused, you glance around, searching for clues. That’s when you notice faint traces of shimmering dust on the ground, forming a trail leading away from the box. Each step you take illuminates more of the path, revealing glimpses of memories you don’t recall living: a child laughing by a stream, a shadowy figure standing at the edge of a forest, a golden key hanging from a chain around someone’s neck.

You realize the dream is guiding you inward—to places buried deep within yourself. As you follow the trail, the world shifts. The room dissolves into a vast, starry expanse. Here, time feels fluid, and every heartbeat echoes like thunder. Before you stands a mirror, but instead of reflecting your face, it shows a younger version of yourself holding the golden key.

The child smiles knowingly and whispers, *"You already know how to open it."* 

But before you can reach out, the scene shatters like glass, and you find yourself back in the original room. The box now radiates warmth, pulsing gently as if encouraging you. Your hands tremble as they hover over the lid. Deep down, you sense the truth—the key isn’t physical; it’s a part of you, waiting to be unlocked.

And then, just as you’re about to touch the box again, everything goes silent. The dream fades, leaving only one lingering thought:

What will you do when you wake up?
