...find food and shelter. The sun beat down mercilessly on my face as I stumbled through a bustling marketplace filled with the cacophony of bartering merchants and bleating livestock.  Dusty stalls overflowed with unfamiliar fruits, vegetables, and spices, their aromas mingling in the air.  My clothes, distinctly out of place in this world of rough-spun tunics and leather jerkins, drew curious glances and whispered comments.  I felt a pang of fear, realizing the extent of my isolation.  I couldn't understand their language, a guttural tongue with rolling R's and unfamiliar inflections.  

My stomach growled, reminding me of my most pressing need.  I tentatively approached a stall piled high with round, brown loaves of bread, gesturing hopefully at one. The stall owner, a woman with a weathered face and kind eyes,  smiled and offered me a piece.  It was coarse and dense, but delicious.  Emboldened, I offered her a small, shiny button from my shirt as payment.  She seemed amused but accepted it, handing me a whole loaf in return.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the marketplace, I knew I needed shelter.  The thought of sleeping in the open, exposed and vulnerable, filled me with dread.  I noticed a group of children playing in the shadow of a large, half-timbered building.  Perhaps there, I could find someone who would understand my plight.  Hesitantly, I approached them, offering a timid smile.  One boy, older than the rest, with eyes as bright as the stars that were beginning to appear in the darkening sky, stepped forward.  He looked at me with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion, then pointed towards the building and uttered a single word: "Sanctuary."  Hope flickered in my chest. Perhaps, in this strange and unfamiliar world, I had found a chance, however slim, at survival.
