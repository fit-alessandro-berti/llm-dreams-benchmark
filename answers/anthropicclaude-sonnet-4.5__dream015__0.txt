# Dream Sequence

You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to...

...climb to the highest point you can find—a crumbling skyscraper that sways unnervingly in the hot wind. Your hands find holds where there shouldn't be any, and gravity feels negotiable, the way it does in dreams.

At the top, you discover a garden. Impossible and lush, with tomatoes growing in spirals and water flowing upward from a broken fountain. An old woman sits there, though you're certain she wasn't there a moment ago. She's knitting something from smoke and fiber optic cables.

"You're late," she says, though you were never invited.

She hands you a seed that pulses with warm light. You know—the way you know things in dreams—that this seed contains the memory of the world before. But when you look down at your palm, it's already sprouting roots into your skin, not painfully, but insistently.

Below, you hear voices. Your companions are calling you, though you can't remember their faces. The old woman is now a crow, or perhaps she always was. The garden begins folding in on itself like origami.

You have to choose: keep the seed, or plant it in the broken earth below. But your hands are making the decision before your mind can, reaching toward the soil that has suddenly appeared beneath your feet...

*What happens next in your dream?*
