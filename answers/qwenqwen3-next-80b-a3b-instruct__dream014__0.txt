You follow them through winding alleyways lit by paper lanterns that glow with soft, golden light—lanterns that hum faintly, as if whispering in a language just beyond understanding. The strangers don’t speak much, but their smiles are warm, their hands steady. One gives you a small, folded piece of origami crane—its wings painted with constellations you’ve never seen but somehow recognize.

As you walk, the city shifts. Skyscrapers become trees with silver bark and windows like eyes. The bustling crowd melts into shadows that drape like velvet cloaks, listening. A child runs past, laughing, carrying a balloon that floats upward—not toward the sky, but into the pavement, vanishing like a sigh.

“You’re not lost,” says the eldest of the strangers, their voice like wind through autumn leaves. “You’re being led.”

You don’t know where you’re going, but your chest feels lighter. The fear that had clenched your throat dissolves like sugar in tea.

Then, you reach a bridge made of stardust and silence. Beneath it, a river flows backward, carrying memories—not yours, but ones you’ve dreamed before: a birthday candle in a rainstorm, your mother singing off-key, the smell of rain on hot pavement the day you first said “I love you” to someone who didn’t say it back.

The strangers bow, one by one, and begin to fade, their forms woven into the lanterns above you.

“Remember,” they whisper in unison, “the way back is always the way you were meant to go.”

You step onto the bridge and look down.

Your own reflection stares back—but it’s not you. It’s every version of yourself you’ve ever feared becoming… and every one you secretly hoped to be.

And then, a whisper—not from them, but from inside you:

*“You were never lost. You were just waiting to remember.”*

You wake.

But on your pillow? A single, shimmering origami crane—its wings now stained with the color of dawn.
