The air grows thick and heavy, the once-gentle rustling of leaves now a frantic whisper as the wind howls through the trees. The sky darkens in an instant—no gradual dusk, but a sudden, suffocating twilight, as if the sun has been swallowed whole. The temperature plummets, your breath fogging in front of you despite the season, and the scent of ozone stings your nose.

Then, the first drop falls—not rain, but something thicker, darker. You look up just as the storm breaks in earnest, and the droplets splattering against your skin are *black*, like ink bleeding from the clouds. The trees shudder, their bark splitting in jagged lines as if something beneath the earth is pushing upward. The ground trembles, roots writhing like serpents, and the path behind you vanishes, swallowed by a creeping, mossy darkness.

A voice—no, not a voice, but a *presence*—slithers into your mind, not with words, but with *feeling*: a cold, ancient hunger, a question without language. *"You are here. Why?"* The storm coils tighter, the black rain pooling at your feet, forming shapes—hands, faces, things with too many eyes. The forest is no longer peaceful. It is *waiting*.

And then, from the heart of the storm, a figure emerges.

At first, it’s just a silhouette against the lightning—a tall, gaunt shape with limbs too long, too *wrong*, moving in ways that make your eyes ache. But as it steps closer, you see it’s not a person at all. It’s a *thing* woven from the storm itself: bark and bone, stormcloud hair, eyes like twin voids. Its mouth doesn’t move, but the voice comes again, this time a whisper in your ear, though its lips never part.

*"You called me."*

And you realize, with a sickening lurch, that you *did*. Not with words. Not with intention. But in the way you’ve always feared the dark, in the way you’ve wondered what lurks just beyond the edge of the path—you *wanted* this. The storm is your fear given form. The forest is your mind.

The figure extends a hand, fingers elongating like roots. The black rain rises from the ground, swirling into a mirror before you. And in its reflection, you don’t see yourself.

You see *what you’re afraid to become*.

The storm holds its breath.

What do you do?
