the wind begins to howl through the trees, bending the branches as if they’re bowing to an unseen force. The sky darkens in an instant, swallowing the sunlight whole. Thunder rumbles in the distance, growing louder with each passing second.  

A flash of lightning splits the sky, illuminating a strange path ahead—one you don’t remember seeing before. The air hums with energy, and the scent of ozone mixes with the damp earth.  

Do you:  
1. **Follow the mysterious path**, drawn by an inexplicable curiosity?  
2. **Seek shelter** under the thick canopy, hoping the storm passes quickly?  
3. **Stand still**, feeling as though the storm is trying to tell you something?  

(What happens next is up to you—dreams are limitless!)
