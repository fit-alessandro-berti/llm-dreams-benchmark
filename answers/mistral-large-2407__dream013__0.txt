As you move deeper into the maze, the puzzles become increasingly intricate and abstract. The walls, adorned with glowing symbols, shift and change, revealing new paths and dead ends. You notice that the symbols on the walls correspond to the puzzles you've been solving, creating a pattern that seems to guide you forward.

Suddenly, you come across a large, circular room with a high, domed ceiling. In the center stands a pedestal, and on it, a intricately designed hourglass. The sand within is unlike any you've seen before, shimmering and flowing upwards instead of down. The hourglass is surrounded by a series of concentric rings, each containing a different puzzle: a riddle written in an ancient language, a complex mathematical equation, a tangled web of strings, and a grid of tiles that seem to move on their own.

A soft, echoing voice fills the room, "Solve the puzzles, align the rings, and turn the hourglass before the last grain of sand falls. Only then will you find your way out."

You approach the first ring, the riddle. As you decipher the ancient language, the words seem to float off the page, swirling around you, whispering clues. You solve it, and the ring rotates, aligning with the next puzzle.

The mathematical equation is next. It's daunting, but you notice that the numbers correspond to the symbols on the walls. Using the patterns you've observed, you solve the equation, and the second ring aligns.

The tangled web of strings is more challenging. Each string hums a different note as you touch it, creating a symphony of sound. You realize that you need to create a specific melody, one that echoes the voice from earlier. After several attempts, you succeed, and the third ring aligns.

Finally, you approach the grid of moving tiles. You understand now that it's a map of the maze, constantly shifting and changing. You use your memory and the patterns you've learned to navigate the tiles, aligning the final ring just as the last grain of sand begins to fall.

With a deep breath, you reach out and turn the hourglass. The room fills with light, the walls of the maze fall away, and you find yourself standing in a peaceful, sunlit field. You've solved the maze, and as you take your first steps into the field, you wake up, the dream fading away, leaving you with a sense of accomplishment and wonder.
