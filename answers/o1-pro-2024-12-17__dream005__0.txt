…each group has a strangely different dynamic. You wander through the grand foyer of the event, a room illuminated by floating orbs of light that seem to bob gently like balloons. The crowd is a tapestry of acquaintances and strangers—some dressed in clothes that feel antiquated and regal, while others wear apparel so modern and minimal it borders on futuristic. All the while, faint music drifts through the air, a tune that reminds you of distant laughter echoing down a long, tiled hallway.

You start with a group near the main entrance. They are clustered around a gilded pedestal draped with lush fabric. They seem friendly yet distracted—though their mouths move, you can’t quite catch what they’re saying. You notice how their eyes dart to the door behind you, as if waiting for someone important to arrive. You try to introduce yourself, to ask if they’ve seen your friend, but your voice emerges oddly muffled, as if you’re speaking through thick velvet. They nod politely and point toward a staircase curving upward, encouraging you to explore other rooms.

You ascend the stairs, and on the next level, you find a small lounge scattered with velvet sofas and peculiar sculptures. A handful of people are seated here, their posture relaxed but their gaze distant. They take small sips from crystal glasses of an iridescent drink. When you mention your friend’s name, a hush falls over the group. They exchange knowing glances, and one person—tall, with a delicate, opaline mask obscuring half their face—leans in and whispers, “They were here, but not anymore.” They gesture to another door on the far side of the lounge.

Through the door, you enter a corridor lit by candles that flicker like stars against deep blue walls. You hear laughter, snatches of conversation that shift languages mid-sentence, and the sound of ice clinking in glasses. You pause at a side room—its entrance framed by a curtain embroidered with constellations—and peek inside. Here, everyone is dancing slowly, dreamily, as if underwater. Music plays from an unseen source, and the dancers wear garments shimmering with tiny mirrors. One of them, spinning gracefully, nearly collides with you. They steady themselves, blinking as if awakening, and say, “Your friend just passed through, carrying a small box.” They point downward, a subtle suggestion that perhaps your friend has gone below.

You find a spiral staircase that leads down into a cellar-like chamber. The atmosphere here is quieter, the air cooler. A group of older guests, dressed in garments from eras you can’t place, are seated around a low table. They’re murmuring to each other, telling fragments of stories: a journey across a desert of shifting glass, a meeting with a king who spoke in riddles, a secret door hidden behind an ordinary wardrobe. You approach them cautiously. They look up, and one speaks as if continuing a conversation you didn’t hear the beginning of: “If you follow the hallway to the end, you might find them.” There is kindness in their tone, and they offer you a small, carved wooden charm in the shape of a key. It feels warm in your hand.

Venturing deeper, the hallway narrows. You pass through curtains of velvet, step over rugs embroidered with cryptic symbols, and finally come to a closed door. The key fits perfectly into the lock, but when you turn it, the door evaporates like mist. On the other side is a quiet balcony overlooking a moonlit garden. You step outside, and there—leaning against the balustrade—is your friend. They are cradling that small box in their hands, looking out over a landscape of strange, shimmering plants.

You approach quietly, relieved. Your friend turns and offers a gentle smile, opening the box to reveal a single piece of folded paper. It’s covered in an intricate handwriting you can’t yet decipher. Your friend hands you the note and says, “I’ve been waiting for you to find me. We’re not meant to understand everything here, but we’re meant to keep looking.” You look at the paper, at the surreal beauty of the garden below, and then back at your friend, finally at ease. Somewhere in the distance, the faint music and laughter continue, reminding you that you are both inside a dream, a place where searching and finding can be the same gentle motion of the heart.
