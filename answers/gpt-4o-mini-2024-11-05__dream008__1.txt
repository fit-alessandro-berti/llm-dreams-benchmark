feel a surge of anxiety as you glance at the clock. The deadline is so close, it's almost as if time is slipping away faster than you can process it. Your desk is cluttered with papers, your computer screen is filled with open tabs, and yet, none of it seems to make sense. 

You take a deep breath, trying to focus, but the pressure is mounting. The project is unlike anything you've tackled before, and the expectations are high. As you start to plan out your steps, you notice your coworkers moving in slow motion, as if the world around you is distorting.

Your boss approaches, but instead of offering support, they stare at you with an unreadable expression. Suddenly, the project you're working on morphs into something completely different – a puzzle that’s made up of floating geometric shapes, each one shifting and changing position on its own. You can’t grasp any of it, and every time you try to place a piece, it vanishes into thin air.

You feel a strange sensation that you're being watched. The walls of the office close in, and you look around for a way to escape this strange, overwhelming scenario. The clock is ticking louder now, and you realize that time has stopped making sense entirely. What do you do next?
