written in a language you've never seen before, swirling like smoke on the page, forming shapes that whisper secrets only half-remembered from childhood. Your heart races as you stare, the proctor—a towering figure with the face of your old elementary school teacher, but eyes like black holes—leans in and murmurs, "The answers are in the margins of your doubts."

Panic surges. You flip the booklet, and there, scrawled in your own handwriting (but you swear you didn't write it), are equations that solve for happiness, diagrams of alternate lives where you became a pirate astronaut instead of this path. Question one: "What color is regret at midnight?" You scribble "neon blue with flecks of gold," and the paper shimmers, approving with a faint glow.

But then the room tilts. Desks fold into origami birds, fluttering toward a ceiling that's now an endless starry sky. Your classmates morph into versions of yourself—successful you, broke you, the you who said yes to that wild road trip in '09. They all turn, pencils poised, and chant, "The future isn't multiple choice; it's a choose-your-own-adventure with no reset button."

You stand, exam forgotten, and leap toward the nearest bird-desk. It carries you through clouds of what-ifs, past the job you almost took, the love you let slip. Below, the exam hall shrinks to a speck, and you realize: this isn't the test. The real one was waking up every day and picking the question anyway.

You jolt awake, sheets tangled, alarm blaring. But on your nightstand, amid the coffee stains and half-read books, a single notecard waits: "What color is your tomorrow?" Scribbled below, in your sleepy scrawl: "Neon blue with flecks of gold."
