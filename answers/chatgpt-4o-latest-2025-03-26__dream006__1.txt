speak, but no sound comes out. Panic flutters in your chest as you clear your throat and try again—still nothing. You glance down, and suddenly the microphone twists and curls like a serpent, slipping through your fingers and slithering away into the shadows at the edge of the stage.

The audience doesn’t react; they remain perfectly still, their faces blurry, as if sketched in charcoal and threatened by rain. Then, one by one, their eyes begin to glow faintly, casting an eerie amber light over the auditorium.

You turn to flee, but your feet are rooted to the stage. Instead, the floor beneath you becomes soft, like warm clay, and begins to rise around you, forming a pulpit that lifts you higher into the air. As it does, a strange calm washes over you. Your voice suddenly returns—not your voice exactly, but deeper, more ancient, as though the words are being spoken through you by something else.

You don’t recognize the language, but the audience does. They begin humming in rhythm, a low droning tone that fills the space like a fog. The lights above dissolve into stars, and soon you’re speaking into the night sky, the stage transforming into a platform hanging over the edge of the cosmos.

You look up—and see your own face in the stars, watching, waiting, and smiling.

And then you awaken.
