You wake in an era that feels both familiar and alien—cobblestones under bare feet, the smell of woodsmoke in the air, the chatter of traders bartering in a tongue you can’t quite place. Every familiar convenience you've taken for granted—your phone, your keys, even the simple act of scrolling through a map—has vanished, replaced by a world that relies on the rhythm of the sun and the clink of coins.

The first thing you notice is the lack of timekeeping. A sundial hangs crooked on a wall, its shadow moving sluggishly; a town crier’s bell rings twice each hour, and the townsfolk seem to count minutes by the rise and fall of the wind through the wheat. You realize you need to learn a basic method to keep track of hours if you're going to make sense of a day without a digital clock.

As you explore the market, you find a small, weather-worn leather pouch tucked away under a trader’s table. Inside it lies an unfamiliar key, its metal warm against your palm, and a crumpled note written in a cramped, looping script. The note reads simply, in no more than four words: *Find the Clockmaker.*

You understand now: to survive, you need to find the Clockmaker. He is the only one in this town who deals in gears, springs, and time. If he knows about your strange arrival, perhaps he can show you how to harness the very mechanics that kept your own world in rhythm.

You make your way to the town square, following the murmur of a river that runs like liquid silver through the streets. A young woman with a braid of black hair stops you and offers a loaf of bread. She says nothing; her eyes, sharp and wary, seem to ask if you’re looking for something. In the silence, your heart beats against your ribs, and the realization that you need to speak like them settles in. If you are to ask for help, you must first understand the language that flows through the market and the sigh of the old town’s wind.

You spend the next day learning how to read and speak this tongue—not from books but from the chatter of hawkers and the rustle of silk. You watch a blacksmith hammer steel with fierce rhythm and mimic his motions, turning your frustration into practice. Each time a word slips out of place, you correct it; each small mistake is a stepping stone toward something larger.

You find yourself at the edge of the town, where a stone arch marks the boundary between the market and the forest. Beyond this arch, you spot the silhouette of a workshop, its windows glowing faintly as if lit by an unseen fire. The key feels heavier in your hand, a subtle reminder of the weight of time and the possibility that it could unlock a door—literally and figuratively.

You approach the workshop and knock. The bell above the door rings twice, a familiar chime that seems to acknowledge you. The door opens on a figure hunched over a workbench, his hands scarred by years of turning brass. He looks up, and his eyes meet yours—an instant recognition sparks between you.

“You’re the one who carries the key,” he says, his voice gravelly but not unkind. He slides a small, intricately carved box across the table, placing it in your trembling hands. “It is the last of an ancient line—those who hold it can bend time, or at least, understand it."

He gestures to a large, humming mechanism behind him, gears whirling like a living heart. “You need to learn how to read this.” He points to the complex array. “Once you can, the clock will point you back.”

The realization hits like a thunderclap: survival in this age isn’t merely about food or shelter; it’s about understanding the very pulse of the world—its clocks, its language, and the people who keep its gears turning. You need to learn to read the language of the past, to master the mechanics of time, and, most importantly, to find the path that will bring you back, or perhaps lead you somewhere else entirely.

And then, as the sun dips below the rooftops and the first star begins to flicker in the twilight sky, you see the key in your hand, warm and alive. A promise, a challenge, a dream that is no longer just an ending—a beginning.
