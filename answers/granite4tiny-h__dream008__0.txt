Here is a possible continuation of your unfinished dream:

Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you feel panicked as the impossible deadline looms closer. You try to rationalize with yourself - this task clearly cannot be completed in time, there must have been some mistake.

But your boss keeps looking expectantly at you. You take a deep breath and tell yourself that you'll just dive in and figure it out somehow. The clock starts ticking as the project stretches out before you like an unsolvable puzzle.

You begin working methodically - researching sources, drafting sections to meet parts of the deadline. But with each passing hour, what should have been manageable tasks balloon into impossible mountains to climb. Deadlines elapse but you've made little headway because there is just so much work yet to finish.

Tears start flowing as exhaustion sets in and hopelessness overwhelms you - how can this be finished? Your mind races, desperately trying to come up with a solution, to find some way out of the impossible situation. You feel like giving in and telling your boss that it's unfeasible when he returns, but there seems no escape.

Suddenly, just as all hope is lost...a breakthrough occurs! A brilliant idea pops into your head that changes everything. Maybe you combine multiple approaches or make a trade-off on some key criteria to find an acceptable compromise solution under the impossible deadline constraints given earlier in the dream.

With new energy and direction, you double down on your strategy, cutting away the superfluous elements until only the essentials remain focused and streamlined for maximum efficiency. Bit by bit, hour after hour...the pieces start coming together as if magic itself is working through you now. 

The clock ticks over final-minute milestones just in time as you finish last refinements before submitting to your incredulous yet impressed boss who had thought the completion of the task an absurdity given previous statements about impossibility - proving that sometimes even impossible tasks can be completed miraculously with just the right kind of problem-solving grit and determination!

The end.
