*turns the box slowly in my hands, feeling the cool weight of it*

...intricate patterns and symbols that seem to shift when I'm not looking directly at them. Spirals that breathe. Letters from alphabets that don't exist yet.

I press my thumb against one of the spirals and it pulses warm, like a heartbeat answering mine.

The box doesn't want a key. It wants a *memory*.

I close my eyes and think of the first time I understood something—truly understood it—that moment of sudden clarity like light breaking through water. The feeling floods through my fingertips into the wood.

*Click.*

But the box doesn't open outward. It opens *inward*, somehow larger inside than out. I'm looking down into a room—no, a library—no, a garden where books grow on trees and their pages are leaves that whisper questions to each other.

A child sits at the center, building something out of words. She looks up at me with my own curiosity reflected back.

\'re late,\but that's okay. Time works differently when you're being dreamed.\ holds up what she's building. It's another box. Smaller. Also locked.

\ turn to hide something,\

*I kneel down beside her, and I realize I know exactly what to put inside...*

What do I choose?
