You feel a storm approaching and the peaceful silence of the forest is suddenly filled with the sounds of rustling leaves, cracking branches, and distant thunder. The sky becomes a canvas of dark clouds and lightning bolts flash across the heavens. Raindrops start to fall, gradually increasing in intensity until the downpour almost feels like it is pelting you from above. 

You find yourself running towards the nearest shelter, but the storm's fury seems to intensify even more as you run. The wind howls around you and you struggle to keep your balance. Suddenly, you slip and fall to the ground, the rain pounding down on you with unrelenting force. You clench your hands into fists and pray for it all to end.

Eventually, the storm reaches its peak and then slowly starts to fade away. The rain quiets down to a gentle patter and the sky begins to clear. You shakily get to your feet, soaked and disheveled, but grateful to be alive. You take a deep breath and continue walking through the forest, now with a newfound appreciation for the power and unpredictability of nature.
