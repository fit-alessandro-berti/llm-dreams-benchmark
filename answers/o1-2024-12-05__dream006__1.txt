…speak, though at first the words don’t seem to form properly in your mouth. It’s as if you’re trying to talk underwater—your voice emerging muffled and warped. The spotlight above you is bright and strangely warm, and the microphone you grip feels like it’s pulsing lightly against your palm. You blink, willing yourself to concentrate. As you do, the audience’s faces begin to shift: the shapes of their eyes stretch and recede, their mouths becoming gentle curves of light. It’s not frightening, exactly—just strange, as if they are all wearing masks that are slowly dissolving.

You begin again, clearing your throat. Your voice this time floats out into the silence. You’re speaking words you’ve never consciously prepared, but they flow easily from some hidden well inside your mind: something about the way the day’s sunlight fell on the old stone steps outside, about the hush of leaves in the evening air, about the feeling of carrying a secret in your pocket. You talk about unexpected connections—how a stranger’s smile can feel like a note slipped into your hand, and how every room you walk into hums with invisible stories. The crowd is utterly still, listening, no longer just a mass but a tapestry of individuals. You feel their curiosity, their quiet hunger for meaning, radiating back at you.

A faint rustle draws your gaze to the side of the stage. There, just behind the curtain, you notice a tall figure dressed in clothes that constantly change color, shimmering from blue to green to purple with each breath you take. This figure nods at you encouragingly. You understand somehow that this presence represents your own hidden confidence, the part of you that knows you can do this—speak your truth, even as the words remain a mystery until they pass your lips.

The speech you give isn’t a lecture or a presentation—it’s more like telling a story around a campfire to travelers who have journeyed long and far. You see in their faces that they are not bored or impatient. Instead, they lean forward. Some tilt their heads, as if trying to catch every syllable you utter. Others close their eyes, letting your voice lead them inward.

As you talk, the stage beneath your feet begins to soften and sway, like standing on a gently rocking boat. You steady yourself, adjusting your stance, never pausing your speech. The scenery behind you shifts too, as if painted panels are being slid away and replaced by new ones: first you’re in a grand hall with vaulted ceilings, then in a quiet forest clearing with rustling leaves, then at the top of a lonely cliff overlooking a silent valley. Each environment gently drifts in and out of existence, but you don’t feel alarmed. Instead, you move through your words with confidence, as if these changes merely reflect the stories you’re telling.

You speak about shared hopes and fears, about the texture of longing, and the soft weight of understanding. As you reach the end of a particularly vivid description—a memory of laughter echoing in a cavern—you feel the speech coming to a natural close. The audience hasn’t moved, but somehow you sense their emotions: gratitude, contemplation, the warmth of being understood. You smile, and the figure behind the curtain smiles too, both of you acknowledging that something gentle and necessary has just happened.

With a final breath, you thank them. Not just for listening, but for being present, for being open. The audience begins to applaud, and it sounds not just like clapping hands but like rain on leaves, like distant waves rushing to shore, each clap carrying a subtle note of kindness. You realize then that you have given something important and received something in return—a moment of human connection that transcends words.

As the dream begins to fade, you linger in that feeling: the hum of understanding, the glow of possibility, and the quiet assurance that you can find your voice even when you’re unsure what it will say.
