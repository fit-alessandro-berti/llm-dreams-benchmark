**Complete the Dream:**

You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **find a way back—or embrace this strange new world.**

The air smells different—earthy, smoky, tinged with herbs you can’t name. The buildings are made of stone and wood, their craftsmanship rough but sturdy. People move about in simple clothes, their faces marked by lives far harder than anything you’ve known.

A voice calls out—a child, pointing at you, whispering to their mother in a language you don’t understand. Panic sets in. How will you survive here? Do you try to blend in, learning their ways? Or do you search for clues—some relic, some hidden knowledge—that might explain your sudden displacement?

Then, you see it—a flicker of something out of place. A glint of metal too smooth, a symbol carved into stone that looks suspiciously modern. Or perhaps you meet someone who seems to know more than they let on, their eyes holding a glimmer of recognition.

But before you can act, shadows stretch unnaturally long, and the whispers grow louder. A storm is coming—or is it something else? The ground trembles faintly, and the sky darkens too quickly. You realize: this isn’t just any past. It’s a past with its own rules, its own dangers… and maybe, just maybe, its own way out.

What do you do next?
