Despite the hardships, you decide to **keep moving forward**, driven by a stubborn spark of hope you refuse to let die. The landscape around you is a vast, broken wasteland â€” rusted metal skeletons of old cities loom against a sky painted with ash and orange dust. Every step you take crunches on cracked earth and forgotten ruins.

You scavenge what little you can: a half-full canteen, a knife dulled by time, a tattered map showing ghost-towns and radiation zones. At night, you build tiny fires, shielded by crumbling walls, and listen to the wind howl like lost souls.

One evening, while trekking across the ruins of an old freeway, you spot something strange â€” **a flicker of green**. Actual green. Heart pounding, you scramble down the broken asphalt, pushing aside debris. Nestled in a sheltered hollow is a **small garden**, thriving somehow against all odds: tomatoes, wild beans, even a few vibrant flowers.

And standing in the middle of it is a figure, cloaked and steady, watching you with wary but not unfriendly eyes.

They call out, their voice rough but alive with cautious warmth:  
*"You're not the first to find this place... but you might be the one we've been waiting for."*

What do you do next? ðŸŒ±
