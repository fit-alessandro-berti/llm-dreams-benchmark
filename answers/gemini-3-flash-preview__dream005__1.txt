...and the air feels thick, like you’re walking through warm honey. 

Every time you turn a corner, the architecture of the house shifts. The hallway stretches longer than the house should allow, lined with velvet curtains that pulse like a heartbeat. 

You pass a group of people wearing oversized animal masks—hares, owls, and foxes—all sitting in a circle on the floor. They aren’t speaking, but the sound of frantic typing fills the air around them, though there isn't a keyboard in sight. As you walk by, the Fox turns its head 180 degrees to watch you, its glass eyes reflecting a version of you that is much older.

You push through a set of double doors and find yourself in a ballroom where the floor has turned into a shallow pool of ink. A group of socialites in shimmering sequins are dancing a waltz, but they are doing it in total silence. Their feet don’t splash; they leave ripples of light that turn into glowing lilies before fading away. You try to ask if they’ve seen your friend, but when you open your mouth, only blue butterflies fly out, fluttering toward the high, vaulted ceiling.

Desperation starts to set in. You see a familiar silhouette at the far end of the room—the one person you know. They are standing by a window that looks out onto a sky with three moons. They turn toward you and wave, their smile warm and grounding.

But as you run toward them, the floor begins to tilt. The "groups" you passed earlier begin to merge; the Fox-masked people are now waltzing with the silent dancers, and they form a living wall between you and your friend. 

"Wait!" you try to shout, but the room is now vibrating with a low, hummed melody that sounds like a thousand cellos. 

You finally reach the spot where your friend was standing, but the window is gone. In its place is a tall, ornate mirror. You lean in to look at your reflection, but instead of seeing yourself, you see the face of your friend looking back at you. 

They wink, and whisper from the other side of the glass: *"Don't worry. I've been here the whole time."*

Suddenly, the floor vanishes. You aren't falling, though. You’re floating upward, through the ceiling and into the dark, star-dusted clouds, as the sound of the party fades into the steady, rhythmic ticking of a clock... 

*Tick. Tick. Tick.*

The dream begins to dissolve into the smell of morning coffee and the weight of your blankets. You are waking up.
