take a step back, your words dissolving in the air like mist. Silence presses between you, thick and vibrating with unspoken feelings. Suddenly, your surroundings seem to shift—the room tilts, colors swirl, and the walls become translucent. 

You and your friend glance at each other, surprised, but before either of you can speak again, the scene changes completely. You now stand together on a platform that floats above winding rivers of light. Below, glimpses of memories—laughter, shared meals, old adventures—flash and ripple in the currents.

The argument's details begin to blur, replaced by an overwhelming sense of connection. With a deep breath, you reach out—not with words, but with a feeling, an intent to understand and to share what matters most. Your friend does the same. It is as if you are both speaking and listening with your whole selves.

Gradually, the rivers of memory flow upwards, surrounding you in warmth. The disagreement, while still unresolved, feels smaller—something you can both hold, examine together, and gently set aside when ready. When you look at your friend again, you both start to laugh, the sound echoing through the dream like distant bells, and the world shimmers in response.
