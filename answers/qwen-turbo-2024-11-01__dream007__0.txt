part ways for a little while to cool off and gather your thoughts. You take a walk in a nearby park, enjoying the fresh air and the calming effect it has on your agitated state.

As you stroll along the path, you notice an old, wise-looking owl perched on a branch above you. It seems almost out of place, given that it's broad daylight. The owl meets your gaze and hoots softly, as if offering some form of comfort or wisdom.

Feeling a bit lighter after the walk, you return home, where you find a note from your friend. They too have taken time to reflect and realize that perhaps they reacted too strongly. They suggest meeting up at their place to talk things through calmly and openly.

You feel relieved and grateful for this gesture, knowing that your friendship is strong enough to weather disagreements. You head over to their house with a sense of hope, ready to listen and be heard, understanding that sometimes, taking a step back can lead to clearer communication and deeper understanding.
