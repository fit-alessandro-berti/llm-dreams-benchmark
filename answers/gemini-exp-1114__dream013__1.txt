...and as I move deeper into the maze, the puzzles become increasingly surreal. The stone walls start to shimmer with faint, shifting patterns, like living hieroglyphs that almost coalesce into meaning before dissolving back into abstract shapes. The air grows thick with a strange perfume, a blend of citrus and something metallic, making it harder to focus.

The next puzzle isn't etched in stone, but formed from shifting columns of sand that rise and fall in a silent, hypnotic dance. The logic I'd relied on earlier feels slippery, inadequate. I try to analyze the patterns of the sand, to decipher a sequence, but my thoughts keep drifting, caught in the swirling grains. A disembodied voice, like wind whispering through reeds, speaks in riddles.

"What is held without hands, seen without eyes, and lost without regret?"

My initial instinct to apply strict deduction fails. The riddle seems to operate on a different level, a level of intuition and feeling rather than cold reason. I close my eyes, trying to clear my mind, to *feel* the answer rather than think it. Time stretches, becomes elastic.

Then, a memory surfaces. A dream within a dream, of holding a soap bubble in my palm, marveling at its fragile beauty before it popped. The loss, a fleeting pang, then nothing. 

"A dream?" I whisper, my voice echoing strangely in the chamber.

The sand columns freeze. The faint glow on the walls intensifies, outlining an archway where none existed before. I've solved it, but not through logic alone. This maze is testing something more, something deeper within me.

Beyond the archway, the maze opens into a vast, moonlit garden. Statues, their faces blurred by time and weather, stand sentinel among gnarled trees. The air vibrates with a low hum, and I can sense the presence of something...ancient. The garden itself feels like a puzzle, a riddle laid out in moonlight and shadow. The path is not clear, but I know I must continue. There is something at the heart of this maze, something I need to understand. And as I step into the garden, I realize the puzzles are not just external, but internal too. The maze is a reflection of my own mind, and the answers lie not just in solving riddles, but in confronting the depths of my own subconscious...
