**Dream Continuation:**

You feel a storm approaching, and the once-gentle breeze turns sharp and cold. The trees begin to sway violently, their leaves rustling like whispers of warning. Dark clouds roll in, swallowing the sunlight, and the forest is plunged into an eerie twilight. A distant rumble of thunder shakes the ground beneath your feet.

You quicken your pace, heart pounding, but the path ahead seems to shift—twisting and narrowing until you’re no longer sure if you’re going forward or in circles. Then, through the storm, you see a faint flicker of light—a small, abandoned cabin nestled between the gnarled roots of an ancient oak.

Do you:

1. **Seek shelter** inside the cabin, where warmth and mystery might await?
2. **Keep moving**, trusting your instincts to guide you through the storm?
3. **Turn back**, even though the path behind looks darker than ever?

*(Or perhaps something unexpected happens—choose your path, and the dream will unfold further...)*
