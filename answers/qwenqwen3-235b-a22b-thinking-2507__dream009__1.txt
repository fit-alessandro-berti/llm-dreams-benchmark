You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **forget how to summon light with a thought.**

The realization hits not with a gasp, but a slow, cold dread as your fingers instinctively fumble for the phone that *isn’t there*. You’re lying on a narrow, straw-stuffed pallet in a low-ceilinged room smelling of damp earth, woodsmoke, and something pungent like drying herbs. Sunlight, weaker and yellower than you remember, filters through a paper-thin window shutter. The only light source is a small clay *deng* (lamp) guttering on a rough-hewn table, its wick smoking in sesame oil.

You step outside into a narrow alley. No hum of electricity, no distant roar of traffic – just the rhythmic *thump-thump* of a loom inside a nearby house, the cluck of chickens, the chatter of unfamiliar dialects (Tang Dynasty Chinese, you realize with a jolt, placing the architecture and clothing), and the pervasive scent of baking *mantou* steamed buns. People move with a purpose you don’t understand, clad in layered silk and hemp, faces etched with a hard-won practicality. A child stares at your strange, close-fitting modern clothes (somehow still on you) with wide, curious eyes before her mother gently pulls her away.

You walk towards a larger street, your mind reeling. *Need to find shelter? Food? Learn the language?* Those needs feel superficial, almost trivial. The *real* need is deeper, more immediate, and terrifyingly fundamental: **You need to unlearn the muscle memory of the modern world.** You watch an elderly woman carefully pour water from a ceramic jug into a basin – no tap, no pipes. Your hand twitches, anticipating the cool click of a faucet handle. *Wrong.* You see a merchant weigh silver ingots on a delicate balance scale – no electronic counter, no scanner. An irrational urge to swipe a card flares uselessly in your palm. *Wrong.*

Then comes the dusk. The street darkens rapidly as the sun dips. People begin moving with renewed purpose, lighting rushlights, hanging lanterns, or simply carrying small clay lamps like the one in your room. Your body reacts before your mind: you instinctively lift your wrist, palm up, *expecting* to see the glowing screen of your watch illuminate the path. **Darkness.** Total, disorienting, *ancient* darkness. Your heart hammers against your ribs. That simple, automatic act – summoning light with a flick of your wrist or a thought – is gone. It wasn’t magic; it was infrastructure, physics, and a lifetime of conditioning. Now, light requires effort, fuel, time, and constant vigilance. You *need* to forget that effortless command over light. You need to accept that darkness isn't just an inconvenience to be banished with a switch, but a tangible, enveloping *presence* you must navigate with careful flame or wait out in patience.

The weight of it crashes over you: **You don’t just need to survive here. You need to become someone new.** Someone who doesn’t *think* a light on. Someone who knows the weight of a water bucket, the time it takes to grind grain, the preciousness of a single candle. Someone who understands that "getting home" isn't a question of GPS or a ride-share app, but a near-impossible journey through time itself. As the last sliver of sun vanishes and the first oil lamps cast long, dancing shadows on the mud-brick walls, you stand frozen in the alley, not lost in the city, but lost in the terrifying, beautiful simplicity of a world where your most basic modern reflex is utterly, dangerously obsolete. The dream isn’t about finding your way *out* yet. It’s about learning how to breathe in the dark. You need to start right now.
