I start to panic, my heart racing as I glance at my phone to check the time. The screen shows "7:23 PM" in bold numbers, and somewhere in my mind I know this meeting is crucial, but the details remain frustratingly hazy. The street around me is lined with tall, angular buildings that seem to shift and curve at impossible angles, their windows glowing with an eerie amber light.

I look around frantically for any landmark or street sign that might help orient me. There's a small café with a faded sign that reads "The Memory Café" - an oddly specific name that doesn't ring any bells. The street name itself is indecipherable, the letters seeming to move and rearrange themselves as I try to focus on them.

My pockets feel empty except for a crumpled piece of paper. I unfold it desperately, hoping for an address or instructions, but the writing smudges and changes as I watch, first showing coordinates, then a phone number that keeps adding and removing digits, and finally just the word "Trust" in handwriting that looks like my own but somehow doesn't feel familiar.

I need to start somewhere. Do I ask the barista at The Memory Café, or do I try to flag down one of the few people walking by, each of whom seems to be speaking in a language that sounds almost like English but isn't quite? The familiar-yet-alien quality of this place makes my skin crawl with that particular dream anxiety - the feeling that I'm running out of time in a place that refuses to make sense.
