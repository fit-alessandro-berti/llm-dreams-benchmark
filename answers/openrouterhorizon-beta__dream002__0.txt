the trees begin to whisper like old friends warning you to hurry. The air grows heavy and electric, the leaves shiver with a silver underside, and a low rumble rolls through the roots at your feet. You look up: the clouds aren’t just gathering, they’re folding into one another like dark velvet being stitched by invisible hands.

A flicker of lightning dances between branches without touching them, as if it’s undecided about being fire or music. You smell rain before it comes—green and mineral, the smell of wet stone and open gates. Somewhere to your left, a narrow path appears that you don’t remember seeing before. It’s lined with pale mushrooms that glow the way a remembered name glows on the tip of your tongue.

You follow, not because you chose to, but because choosing seems unnecessary here. The first raindrops are warm and deliberate, as though someone up there is knocking politely. When they land on your skin, you feel not wetness but a soft hum—like each drop is a tiny bell tuned to a feeling you can almost name. Relief? Anticipation?

A gust lifts the forest’s canopy and, for a second, the sky shows its ribcage: jagged light bones, cloud-sinew trembling. You wrap your arms around yourself, and you notice your sleeves are made of bark. When did that happen? Your fingertips are green with new leaf, tender and curling. You press them to your chest and feel a heartbeat that isn’t only yours. It’s deeper, older, as steady as a drum drowned in moss.

Ahead, the path opens into a small clearing. In its center, a stone well without a rope or bucket. The storm circles it like a great bird deciding whether to land. Each thunderclap doesn’t frighten you—it answers you, somehow, as if you had asked a question by walking here. The well’s lip is slick with rain, and inscribed along the edge are words you can’t read and absolutely understand: Come back.

You lean over the darkness. Instead of your face, you see the forest reflected in lacquered midnight. Then, a ripple. Someone—or something—looks up from beneath the surface. It has your eyes but not your doubts. It smiles a soft, impossible smile and lifts a hand, inviting.

Lightning blooms, white and gentle, and the downpour suddenly loosens into a curtain. Each drop slows in midair, suspended like beads on invisible strings, and you step through them. The storm becomes a room and the trees become doorways. You understand, all at once: the change in weather wasn’t a warning. It was a key. It was the forest remembering you, and you remembering the forest.

You take the hand. There’s the cool shock of water and the warmth of a hearth. When you surface, you are standing again in the clearing, but the world has turned inside out. The rain now falls upward, returning to the clouds. The thunder breathes in, not out. The mushrooms close their small mouths, satisfied. And you feel light, the way a word feels light when you finally say it aloud.

Somewhere deep in the trees, something begins to sing—the storm, or the old heart inside the roots, or the part of you that lived here before names. You walk toward the song. You don’t hurry. You aren’t afraid. The weather passes through you like a memory, and the forest opens, patient, as if it has been waiting a very long time for you to come home.
