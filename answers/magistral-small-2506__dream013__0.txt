**Complete the Dream:**

You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, the air grows thick with the scent of old parchment and ink.

The walls shift subtly around you, rearranging themselves when you aren’t looking, forcing you to rely on memory and observation rather than fixed landmarks. The puzzles themselves seem to change—one moment, it’s a cryptic riddle inscribed in golden letters on a stone slab; the next, it’s a three-dimensional labyrinth of mirrored glass that distorts your reflection into impossible shapes.

At the center of the maze, you find a towering door, its surface etched with a final, unsolvable puzzle—a tangled web of symbols that shift like living things. As you reach out to touch them, the dream begins to unravel at the edges, reality dissolving like ink in water. A voice—yours or not?—whispers, *"The key was always the question."*

Then—you wake.
