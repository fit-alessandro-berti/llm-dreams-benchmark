As she walked around my head, the familiar sounds that came from her mouth filled my ears as she smiled warmly at me with bright pink eyes. Her hair was messy and her clothes were plain enough for the day's tasks; I couldn't say how long she had been here before this dream but I didn't feel like any of mine would have worked. She handed me a small device, its screen glowing bright orange in the dim light of the crowded city streets - or so it was supposed to. As I put in my payment and scanned the code on the device, I could sense her warmth there beneath my eyes that suggested she loved me for who I am beyond my physical form.
