You are in a maze filled with complex puzzles. Each puzzle requires intense concentration and logical thinking to solve, and as you move deeper into the maze, you notice the walls beginning to shift like living vines, whispering riddles in forgotten languages. The air grows thicker, scented with the metallic tang of rain on old coins, and the puzzles evolve from mere locks and levers into ethereal conundrums—mirrors that reflect alternate versions of yourself, each demanding you choose which "you" is real to proceed.

Deeper still, the logic you cling to starts to unravel. A puzzle presents itself as a chessboard where the pieces are your own memories, marching against shadowy opponents that mimic your deepest fears. You sacrifice a childhood recollection to capture a queen shaped like regret, only to find the board melting into a river of ink that carries you to the next chamber. Concentration falters; your thoughts echo back at you, distorted, urging you to question if the maze is solving you instead.

Suddenly, at the heart of it all, you reach a vast atrium where the final puzzle awaits: a colossal hourglass filled not with sand, but with swirling stars. To solve it, you must invert time itself, reliving a moment from your waking life backward. As you do, the maze walls crumble into petals of light, revealing that the exit was never a door, but a mirror of your own face, smiling in realization. You step through, and the dream dissolves into wakefulness, leaving you with a lingering puzzle in your mind: was the maze ever real, or just a reflection of the riddles you carry inside?
