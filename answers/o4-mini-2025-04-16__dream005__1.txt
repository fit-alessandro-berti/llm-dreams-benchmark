…you notice each group seems to exist in its own little world, disconnected from the next by subtle shifts in light and sound.

First, you drift toward a semi‑circle of people lounging on oversized floor cushions. They pass around a translucent sphere that pulses softly with color—when you pick it up, you hear laughter echoing from somewhere deep inside you, but when you look up again they’ve all vanished.

You step through an archway into a hushed library, shelves stacked floor to ceiling with books bound in unfamiliar skins. A single reader sits at a small desk under a green‑glass lamp, head bowed. When you ask if they’ve seen your friend, they only slide a blank journal across the desk. Opening it, you find empty pages that flutter as though stirred by invisible wings.

Beyond the library is a grand ballroom. Masked dancers whirl around you in slow, elegant circles. Each mask is different—some gilded and serene, others plain paper with charcoal eyes. A soft violin melody drifts through the room, but whenever you try to step closer, the dancers shift apart, leaving only empty floor.

You follow a corridor lit by flickering lanterns, walls lined with portraits whose eyes seem almost alive. At the end, a small café appears, tables floating inches above the polished marble floor. A barista presses a coffee cup into your hand without a word. The steam curls into shapes that spell your friend’s name—then dissolves.

Finally, you push open a large arched door into a sunlit garden. There, your friend stands beneath a flowering tree, smiling and holding out a single white blossom. As you reach for it, the petals scatter into the breeze—and you awake, the flower cool and real in your palm.
