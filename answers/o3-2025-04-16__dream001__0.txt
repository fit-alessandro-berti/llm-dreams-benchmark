…move, half‑walking, half‑floating, through streets that seem to redraw themselves each time you glance away. The skyscrapers look like stacks of folded origami, their windows fluttering like paper birds. You pat your pockets for a phone or an address—nothing but a metro token engraved with a symbol you don’t recognize: a small hourglass whose sand runs upward.

1. Seeking directions  
You hurry toward a newsstand where the magazines hum softly, but the vendor speaks only in colors, exhaling plumes of turquoise and amber instead of words. When you show him the hourglass token, he points a crimson beam toward an alley that didn’t exist a heartbeat ago. The beam solidifies into a ribbon of light, and instinct tells you to follow it.

2. The alley of clocks  
The alley narrows into a corridor lined with wall clocks, each ticking at a different tempo. Your watch reads 54 minutes left, 53… 52—yet some of the clocks spin backward, others pause, and one runs in perfect sync with your heartbeat. You decide to trust that one and keep moving, even as the floor becomes a glass sidewalk suspended above a night‑blue void.

3. The taxi of forgotten routes  
A yellow cab rises from the darkness beneath the glass, as though bobbing up from an invisible sea. Its headlights spell your name across the transparent floor. You climb in. The driver’s face is hidden behind a rear‑view mirror that reflects only your own eyes. “Where to?” he asks in your voice. Panicked, you stammer, “To the meeting.” He nods and the cab accelerates—straight up a vertical boulevard that curls onto the ceiling.

4. Arrival at the Tower of First Impressions  
The car deposits you before a tower shaped like a spiral notebook, pages fluttering in a breeze that smells of fresh ink. A revolving door turns by itself; each pane shows a different version of you—confident, nervous, late, early. You choose the pane where you look perfectly composed and step through.

5. The lobby of silent elevators  
Inside, a fountain flows upward, water rising into marble instead of falling. An elevator opens with a sigh, but the floor numbers are emotions: Anticipation, Doubt, Resolve, Wonder. You press Resolve. The doors close, and music you’ve never heard but somehow remember begins to play.

6. The conference room beyond time  
When the doors open, you’re in a vast circular chamber whose walls are clocks without hands. A single chair waits at the center beside a small table. On it lies a folder labeled “Agenda: Becoming.” No one else is present. You sit, open the folder, and find a mirror inside. The mirror shows you standing in the doorway, walking toward yourself, then sitting again—an infinite loop.

7. Realization  
The looping image breaks when you place the hourglass token onto the mirror’s surface. The hourglass flips; its sand now flows normally, softly hissing. The clocks on the walls sprout hands and all point to exactly this moment. A voice from everywhere and nowhere says, “You made it on time.”

8. Awakening  
A gentle vibration—your real‑world alarm—blurs the room. The mirror fades to white, the chair dissolves, and the spiraling tower uncoils into daylight. Just before you open your eyes, you hear your own voice, calm and certain: “Next time, remember—the meeting is always here.”

You wake up in bed, heart steady, a faint taste of turquoise and amber on your tongue, and—on the nightstand where your phone should be—an unfamiliar metro token etched with a tiny hourglass whose sand runs upward.
