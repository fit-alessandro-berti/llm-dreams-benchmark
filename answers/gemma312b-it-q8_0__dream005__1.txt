Right now, there are twinkling, shimmering streamers everywhere. Silver ones and these ridiculously long gold ones threaded through potted ferns… ferns that grow **purple**. My dress feels floaty, almost unbearably so; it’s something sheer and peach-colored, and my feet are undeniably in glitter sandals, something the sensible part of me would *never* wear. 

I’m supposed to meet Silas at this, this grand hall… a labyrinth of chandeliers and velvet ropes and oddly fragrant air – honeysuckle? Is it even the right sort of climate for honeysuckle? And it all seems to *slope*, gently downwards in every direction. I glance for familiar faces, anything that feels safe, but I only know Silas, thank goodness for small merceries.

As I try and remember how he described the location (something about looking for the fountain with the glass koi...), I bump into what appears to be a convention for very intense mushroom enthusiasts. They're gathered around a table showcasing…giant mushrooms. Actually *living*, growing in glass jars. They'll look at me, and give me this look, this patient, knowing look that suggests I'm missing something deeply profound regarding fungal networks and their spiritual significance. "Lost, dear? Are you tuned in to the mycorrhizal resonance of the moment?” a woman asks, her voice echoing slightly through the hall.  I politely mutter something about needing an aisle to navigate, acutely aware of a creeping feeling I should say more about symbiotic mycelial connections. 

Pushing past them, I edge toward a cluster radiating an almost suffocating layer of laughter and extravagant hats. They seem to be judging... *everything*. Their faces are like frozen masks of impeccable taste. One man, sporting a bowler so high it defies the rules of physics, stops me. "My dear," he drones, adjusting his magnifying-covered monocle. "Are you *quite* sure that hue is complementary to your complexion. Peaches are notoriously challenging, you know.”

Just as I start to formulate a ridiculously passive-aggressive comeback about artistic choices and subjective perspectives, a burst of lively polka music pulls me forward. I’m now in the middle of what can only be described as a badger polka-dancing competition. Yes. Seriously.  Badgers in tiny outfits, whirling around tables, occasionally tripping over the fringe of a woman's enormous, sunflower-print dress, who cheers wildly. It really looks legit; people are awarding tiny trophies of painted acorns and leaves. One particularly exuberant badger pauses mid-twirl, sniffs the air and locks eyes with me. It seems… displeased and lets out a little chuffing grunt. I reflexively dodge a rogue accordion player bumping and grinning widely. I just…I have to keep going.


Suddenly and for no discernable reason, I'm wading across… snow? The whole ballroom seems to be transforming into a miniature Arctic display. Tiny pine trees are sprouting from the carpets, and flakes of artificial snow swirl gently around tiny puffins sporting little woollen scarves.  I stop dead, because beside a hastily erected penguin sanctuary there is Silas. Except this wasn’t Silas like him from real life.
This was Silas built of gingerbread. 


He looked at me, a cascade of candied sugar falling from his frosted limbs. "Well? What did you find on your grand journey?” his gingerbread voice, a little raspy with candied almond glue asked, slightly tilting his frosted head. “Were there enough challenges to truly appreciate the sweetness of reunion?"



And then I woke up. But there was a faint, lingering sweetness in the back of my throat.
