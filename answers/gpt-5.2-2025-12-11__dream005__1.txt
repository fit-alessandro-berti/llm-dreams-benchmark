…as you drift through the room, the noise keeps changing texture—laughter in one corner, a hush like a library in another, a burst of music that seems to be playing from inside the walls.

At first you’re confident you’ll spot the one familiar face. You tell yourself it’s simple: just scan, wave, anchor yourself. But everyone is standing in circles that close a little when you get near, as if the air around them is elastic.

A woman with a glass of something clear catches your eye and tilts her head. “You’re looking,” she says, not quite a question.

“I’m trying to find my friend,” you answer. The word *friend* feels heavier than it should.

She points toward a hallway that wasn’t there a moment ago. “They were just over there. Or they will be. Depends what you mean by find.”

You step into the hallway and it stretches longer than the building should allow. Doors line the walls, each one slightly ajar, each one spilling out a different kind of light.

From the first door comes the sound of your own voice—confident, fast, telling a story you don’t remember living. You peek in and see a version of yourself surrounded by people who are nodding and leaning in. You close the door quickly, embarrassed for reasons you can’t name.

The next door smells like rain on hot pavement. Inside, a group of strangers is sitting on the floor, sorting photographs into neat piles. One of them holds up a picture of you at the gathering, only you’re standing beside the person you’re looking for—your arm casually around their shoulder, your face turned toward them like it’s the most natural thing in the world.

“Can I have that?” you ask.

The stranger smiles as if you’ve said something adorable. “If you take it, you’ll have to remember it.”

“I don’t mind,” you say, but even as you reach for the photo, your hand slows. The image feels warm, like it’s been in someone’s pocket.

You pull your hand back. The stranger shrugs and places the photo in a pile labeled *Later*.

You keep walking.

At the end of the hallway is a staircase leading down, but the steps are made of something soft, like stacked pages of a book. When you put your foot on the first one, text rises up in small black letters under your shoe—snatches of conversation, half-formed names, the beginning of a joke. You descend, and the words shift to keep you from reading the same sentence twice.

Downstairs is quieter. The party still exists above you, but here the sound is muted, like you’re underwater.

A bar is set up against a wall of mirrors. Behind it stands a bartender in a crisp white shirt, polishing a glass that never gets clean. When you approach, he looks up with an expression that suggests he’s been expecting you all night.

“Still looking?” he asks.

“Yes,” you say. “I only know one person here.”

He nods as if you’ve confessed something. “Then you’re not lost. You’re just early.”

“I don’t understand.”

He slides a drink toward you. The liquid inside is the same color as the light between streetlamps. You don’t pick it up.

“People come to gatherings like this,” he says, “and they think the point is to find someone familiar so the room will stop moving.” He gestures at the mirrors. In each reflection you’re doing something slightly different—laughing, frowning, checking your phone, standing perfectly still. In one of them you’re already talking to your friend, leaning close as if the room is loud.

You turn toward that mirror.

“Which one is real?” you ask.

The bartender’s smile is almost kind. “The one you walk into.”

The mirror with your friend in it shimmers, like the surface of a pond when a stone is thrown. Your stomach drops with the certainty that if you touch it, it will accept you as easily as water accepts a hand.

Before you can decide, someone behind you clears their throat.

You turn.

It’s a person you don’t recognize at first because they are holding themselves in a way that feels too familiar—shoulders slightly hunched as if protecting something tender, eyes scanning the room like they’re also trying to find one person. They look like they’ve been searching for a long time.

“Hi,” they say, and their voice is quiet but unmistakable. It’s the voice you were listening for without realizing.

Your brain stutters, trying to place them. “Do I know you?”

They laugh softly. “You do. You’re just not used to seeing me like this.”

They step closer and the air shifts, bringing with it a memory that doesn’t arrive as an image but as a sensation: sitting side by side somewhere, knees touching, the ease of not having to perform.

“You’re—” you start.

“Your friend,” they say, gently, as if correcting a child. “The one you came in with. The one you’re always sure you’ll lose.”

Relief rises in you so fast it almost hurts. “I’ve been looking everywhere.”

“I know,” they say. Their eyes flick toward the shimmering mirror. “You keep trying to find me the way you find things in real life. Like I’m an object you misplaced.”

“I’m sorry,” you say, though you’re not sure what you’re apologizing for. The room feels suddenly too small, too full of reflections and doors and versions of you.

Your friend reaches out and takes your hand. Their palm is warm. Solid. Real enough to make you doubt all of the rest.

“Do you want to go back upstairs?” they ask. “We can pretend this is normal.”

“Is it not?” you ask.

They tilt their head. “It can be.”

As they lead you toward the staircase, the bartender speaks again without looking up. “If you go back up,” he says, “you’ll meet a hundred people and still only know one. If you go through the mirror, you’ll know more than you can carry.”

You stop, caught between the two choices like a needle hovering over a record.

Your friend squeezes your hand. “You don’t have to decide everything tonight,” they say. “That’s the trick. The gathering is always changing, but you’re allowed to leave.”

“Leave?” you echo.

They nod toward a narrow door beside the mirrors, almost invisible, painted the same color as the wall. It has no handle—only a small indentation where your fingers would fit, like the door is waiting to be opened by someone who knows exactly what it feels like.

You walk to it and press your fingertips into the indentation.

The door swings open with a sigh.

On the other side is not a hallway or a street or even a room, but a dawn-colored blankness that smells like clean sheets and distant thunder. For a moment you feel weightless, as if the idea of your body is optional.

You look back. The bar, the mirrors, the staircase made of words—all of it is still there, humming with possibility. Your friend stands behind you, half in shadow, half in that strange light, watching you with a patient expression that makes something in your chest unclench.

“Will I forget?” you ask.

“Some of it,” they say. “Not the important part.”

“And what’s the important part?”

They step closer, and when they speak it feels like the center of the dream finally revealing itself, simple and undeniable.

“That you found me,” they say. “And that you can find me again.”

You take one last look at the mirror where you’re laughing with them already, at the bartender polishing the same glass, at the party murmuring above like a distant ocean.

Then you step through the door.

The blankness rushes around you, soft and bright. The sound of the gathering fades. The light becomes a ceiling. The smell becomes your pillow.

And just before you wake, with the last thread of the dream still wrapped around your finger, you hear your friend’s voice—close, steady, familiar—say your name as if it has always belonged to you.
