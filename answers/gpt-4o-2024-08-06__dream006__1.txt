speak, but as you open your mouth, no words come out. Panic starts to set in, and you feel a wave of anxiety washing over you. You glance down at the podium, hoping for notes to guide you, but the pages are blank. The silence stretches on, and the crowd begins to murmur, their faces a blur of anticipation and confusion.

Suddenly, you remember a trick you've heard about controlling dreams. You concentrate and imagine that you're holding a microphone that can magically amplify your thoughts into clear, eloquent speech. Slowly, you raise your hand, and a shiny, futuristic microphone appears, glowing softly.

You take a deep breath, and as you speak into the microphone, your thoughts flow seamlessly into words. The audience listens intently, captivated by your newfound confidence. You talk about a subject dear to your heart—perhaps it's a message of hope and unity, or an exploration of creativity and imagination. With each sentence, the crowd becomes more engaged, nodding and applauding.

As you conclude your speech, you look out and see the audience rising to their feet, giving you a standing ovation. Relief and joy flood through you. You take a bow, noticing that the once-blurry faces are now distinct and filled with appreciation.

As you leave the stage, someone hands you a small slip of paper. It reads, "Dreams can be what you make of them." You smile, understanding the hidden wisdom, as the scene begins to fade and you drift into a new chapter of your dream.
