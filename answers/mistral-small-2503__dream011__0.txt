As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language you've never seen before. The symbols and characters swirl and shift before your eyes, making it impossible to focus on any single question. Panic starts to rise in your chest as you glance around the room. Everyone else seems to be writing effortlessly, their pens moving smoothly across the paper.

You try to calm yourself, taking deep breaths, but the air feels thick and heavy. The room begins to grow warmer, and the hum of whispers from your classmates turns into a distant buzz, like the sound of a swarm of bees. You look down at your exam paper again, and this time, the symbols start to rearrange themselves into familiar English words, but they form sentences that make no sense:

"Whispering shadows dance with the moonlit cheese, while the silent river sings songs of forgotten stars."

You try to write something, anything, but your pen feels like it weighs a ton. As you struggle to put it to paper, the room starts to spin. The walls begin to close in, and the ceiling lowers, pressing down on you. The other students start to morph into strange, shadowy figures, their faces contorted into eerie smiles.

Suddenly, the exam paper bursts into flames, and the fire spreads rapidly across your desk. You jump back, but the heat is intense. Just as you think you might be engulfed, the fire transforms into a shimmering pool of water. You reach out to touch it, and as your fingers brush the surface, the water turns into a mirror.

In the reflection, you see yourself standing in a lush, green field under a clear blue sky. The exam room and the strange symbols are gone, replaced by a sense of peace and tranquility. You take a deep breath, and as you exhale, you wake up, the remnants of the dream fading away like the last wisps of a morning fog.
