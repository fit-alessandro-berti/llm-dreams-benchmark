**The Dream Continues:**

You take a deep breath, your pulse quickening as you step out of the dimly lit alley where you’d been hiding—your only clue was a flickering neon sign of a half-collapsed clock tower, its hands frozen at 3:17. The air smells of ozone and something metallic, like old blood or melted wax. The city stretches before you in jagged, shifting layers: buildings that shouldn’t exist—some towering like skyscrapers, others crumbling into surreal, organic shapes that seem to breathe. The streets are alive with figures in mismatched outfits: a woman in a suit of polished black leather with too many joints, a child wearing a mask of pressed metal that hums when you look at it, and a man in a coat that shifts colors like a chameleon, whispering in a language you don’t recognize.

A sudden *thud* echoes from the alley behind you. You turn—just in time to see a shadow detach from the wall, a figure wrapped in a cloak of smoke, its face obscured by a mask of cracked glass. It tilts its head, and the glass cracks like ice. *"You’re late,"* it says, voice like dry leaves scraping stone. *"The meeting isn’t just about time. It’s about what you’ve left behind."*

Before you can respond, the ground beneath you *rips open*—not a hole, but a *door*, a spiral staircase descending into darkness. The air here is thick with the scent of ozone and something older, like the first breath of a sleeping giant. The walls pulse faintly, like veins. At the bottom, a figure waits: a woman in a dress of woven shadows, her hands glowing with faint, shifting light. She holds out a key, its surface etched with symbols that rearrange when you look at them. *"This city remembers,"* she murmurs. *"And so does it remember you."*

You hesitate. The meeting is in an hour. But the clock tower’s sign flickers—now it reads **3:18**. And the key in your hand feels warm, almost *alive*.

**What do you do?**

*(Do you take the key? Follow the staircase? Or step into the alley and ask the shadow-thing for directions?)*
