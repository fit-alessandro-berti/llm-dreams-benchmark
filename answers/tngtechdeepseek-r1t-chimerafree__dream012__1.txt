stand at the helm, rain stinging your face as the ship groans beneath you. The crew’s anxious eyes reflect flashes of lightning, but you steady your voice and shout above the chaos: **"Reef the sails! Hard to starboard!"**  

As the wheel turns beneath your hands, something shifts—not just in the storm, but in *you.* A strange calm cuts through the fear. The black clouds part just enough to reveal a flicker of light on the horizon, not from the moon or stars, but something deeper, warmer.  

You steer toward it, the crew trusting your sudden certainty. The sea’s rage lessens, the waves now carrying the ship instead of fighting it. When the light blooms brighter, the storm falls silent. Ahead lies an island shrouded in mist, its shores glowing faintly, as if waiting.  

The crew murmurs in awe, but you feel it first—the dream’s unspoken truth. This storm wasn’t an end. It was a door.
