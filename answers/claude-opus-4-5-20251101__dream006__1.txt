The audience starts humming a single note together—a resonance I can feel in my chest. My voice joins theirs without my permission, and suddenly I realize the speech was never about words at all.

I look up and there's no ceiling anymore, just an impossible night sky where the stars are rearranging themselves into a question I almost understand.

Someone in the back row stands. It's me, but younger. Or older. They smile and mouth something I can't quite—
