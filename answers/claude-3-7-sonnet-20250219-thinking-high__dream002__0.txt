# The Forest Dream

You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air becomes electric with tension. The once-gentle breeze transforms into a wind that makes the trees whisper urgent warnings. Strangely, you can understand them.

\ the ancient oak,\ darkens to an impossible shade of purple, and raindrops begin to fall—but they're warm and feel like tiny fingertips against your skin. You run, not in fear but with a curious exhilaration, as the forest floor begins to illuminate with each step you take, leaving glowing footprints behind you.

You find the ancient oak tree, its trunk wider than any you've seen before. Within its massive roots is a hollow space, perfectly your size. As you crawl inside, the storm reaches its crescendo outside, but you feel oddly safe. The inside of the tree is unexpectedly spacious, lit by thousands of tiny creatures that resemble fireflies but shine in all colors of the rainbow.

An old woman sits across from you, weaving something from light itself. She looks up and smiles as if she's been expecting you all along.

\ storm always brings the dreamers,\ rustling leaves. \ before you wake?\
