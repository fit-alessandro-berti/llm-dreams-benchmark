You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world, with resources scarce and dangers everywhere. Despite the hardships, you decide to **dedicate my time to cultivating a small, hidden garden. It's nestled within the skeletal remains of a collapsed skyscraper, shielded from the scorching sun and the prying eyes of raiders by twisted metal and hanging vines. The air is thick with the scent of decay, yet within my little sanctuary, the promise of life blooms.

I'm not alone, though. A grizzled, old woman with eyes that have seen too much, but still hold a spark of defiance, is already tending to the garden. She calls herself "Willow," and she moves with a surprising agility for her age. She gestures towards a small patch of vibrant green sprouts, "That's the hope, child. We need food, but more than that, we need to believe in something."

We work in silence for a while, the only sounds the rustle of the wind through broken windows and the rhythmic scrape of our tools against the parched earth. Willow teaches me how to carefully ration the meager water supply, collected from rain-filled cisterns, and how to identify the few edible plants that stubbornly cling to life in the wasteland. We share stories, whispers of the world before, tales of sunshine and laughter, a desperate attempt to hold onto the memories of what we've lost.

Suddenly, a guttural shout echoes from the street below. Raiders. I see them, shadowy figures with crude weapons, moving towards the building. Fear grips me, cold and paralyzing. My instinct screams to hide, to disappear. But Willow grips my arm, her grip surprisingly strong. Her eyes, now filled with a fierce, almost manic intensity, lock onto mine.

"This garden," she rasps, her voice barely a whisper, "this is our future. We protect it. Now go!"

She pushes me towards a narrow opening in the rubble that leads to a secret passage she discovered months ago. It’s a claustrophobic tunnel, dark and damp, filled with the scent of earth and something else… something metallic. As I crawl through the passage, I hear the clash of metal, Willow’s defiant yells, and the desperate, echoing sounds of the ensuing struggle.

What happens next? Will I find a way to help Willow? Will the garden survive? And what is that metallic smell leading to? The dream suddenly shifts, and as I emerge from the passage, I find…
