notice that the puzzles not only increase in complexity but also seem to change subtly based on your thoughts and emotions. You begin to wonder if the maze itself is alive, responding to your presence.

As you solve each puzzle, you feel a surge of satisfaction, but also an undercurrent of unease. The walls of the maze are adorned with cryptic symbols that seem familiar yet just beyond your understanding. The silence is broken only by the sound of your footsteps and the faint hum of an unknown energy.

Suddenly, you reach a dead end. The walls close in, forming a small chamber with a single pedestal in the center, holding an object that glows with a soft, otherworldly light. As you reach for it, the maze begins to tremble, and you hear a distant, haunting voice: "The final test begins..."

What do you do?
