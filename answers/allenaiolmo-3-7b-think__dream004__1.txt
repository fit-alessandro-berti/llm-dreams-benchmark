You are dreaming. Can you complete the following dream?

You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas and feel an inexplicable urge to touch it. To your surprise, your fingertips sink into the surface, and the canvas ripples like liquid light, responding to your presence. A swirl of indigo and gold erupts, forming a half-formed figure—a dancer with limbs of spiraling vines and a face made of shifting constellations. The ground beneath you dissolves into a mosaic of fractured mirrors, reflecting not your face, but fragments of other dreams: a storm of origami cranes, a desert of melting clocks, and a forest where trees grow upside-down.  

The canvas pulses, as if breathing. A voice, neither yours nor your own, whispers: *"What do you want to become?"* Before you can answer, the dancer’s vines snake toward you, weaving a path that twists through the mirrors. You follow, but the path unravels into a labyrinth of your own memories—childhood doodles, a childhood drawing you’ve never seen before, a door that wasn’t there yesterday. The canvas now shows a storm approaching: jagged shards of glass orbiting a black sun, casting prismatic shadows that distort your body into a kaleidoscope of animal forms (a fox with butterfly wings, a fish with wings, a tree with eyes).  

The voice returns, softer: *"Paint the storm."* Your hands move instinctively, blending colors onto the canvas. The storm parts, revealing a hidden valley where the sky is a gradient of twilight hues, and the ground is made of liquid silver. But as you add more strokes, the valley begins to *change*—the silver seeps into the shapes of your hands, turning them translucent. The dancer’s vines now bind your arms, pulling you toward the center of the canvas, where the black sun is growing.  

Just as the blackness consumes the edge of your vision, you realize the canvas isn’t blank—it’s a *mirror*. And in the reflection, you see not yourself, but a thousand versions of your future selves: some fading into light, others dissolving into smoke, one standing still, hands open as if to receive something. The voice hums: *"What will you choose to hold?"*  

You wake, but the valley lingers in your dreams, its colors seeping into the edges of your eyelids. The last thing you remember is the feel of the canvas beneath your palms, warm and alive, and the echo of a question that wasn’t yours to ask.

*(The dream ends, but the canvas remains—a faint glimmer in the corner of your vision, waiting for the next dreamer to approach.)*
