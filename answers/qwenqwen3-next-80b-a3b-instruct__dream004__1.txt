You are in a world where colors and shapes are constantly changing. As you explore this surreal landscape, you come across a blank canvas—and it’s not resting on an easel, nor pinned to a wall. It floats, suspended in midair, humming softly like a dying star. Around it, the air shimmers with half-formed hues: violet spirals dissolve into liquid gold, geometric polygons blink like eyes, and soundless melodies ripple through the sky as if painted by invisible hands.

You reach out—but your fingers don’t touch the canvas. Instead, they pass through it, and in that moment, you feel not emptiness… but *anticipation*. 

A voice, neither male nor female, neither young nor old, whispers—not from anywhere, but from within your ribs:

> “You are the brush.  
> You are the silence between notes.  
> You are the color the world forgot to name.”

A single tear falls from your eye—electric blue, shimmering with constellations—and as it strikes the canvas, the world *breathes*.  

The blankness ripples.  

A tree sprouts—not of bark or leaf, but of forgotten lullabies, its branches curling into the shapes of your childhood best friend’s laugh. From its roots pours a river of silver letters spelling out every name you’ve ever been called—kindly, cruelly, mistakenly. Above, the sky cracks open like an eggshell, revealing not clouds, but dreams you abandoned: the violin you never learned, the letter you never sent, the love you convinced yourself wasn’t real.

And then—you see it.

Tucked into the lower right corner, subtly woven into the tapestry of your creation, is a tiny, perfect painting of *you*.

Not as you are.  
Not as you wish to be.

As you were, before you learned how to hide.

Your hands—curled, trembling, alive—reach for the tiny image. 

The canvas begins to flutter like a bird with paper wings.

You realize: this isn’t a world you’ve entered.

It’s a world you *forgotten*. 

And now, you are remembering it… one brushstroke at a time.

As the canvas unfolds into a thousand other canvases, each breathing their own dream, the voice murmurs again:

> “Now paint the next one…  
> and don’t forget to leave a spot for wonder.”

You smile.

And you begin.
