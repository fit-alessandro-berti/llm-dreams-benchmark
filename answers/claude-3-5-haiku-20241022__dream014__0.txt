I'll continue the dream scenario:

You feel their warmth and compassion wash over you. They gather around you, each pointing in a different direction, their voices soft and reassuring. As they speak, the city's overwhelming noise begins to fade, and you realize they're not just giving directions, but sharing fragments of a map that seems to shift and change like liquid silver.

One stranger hands you an old compass with an unusual symbol etched on its face. Another whispers something about a hidden street that only appears when the light is just right. The city's architecture begins to blur and reshape itself around you, streets bending like ribbons, buildings leaning in closer as if listening.

You feel a sense of both comfort and mystery. Something tells you that finding your way isn't just about a physical destination, but about understanding something deeper about yourself. The strangers smile knowingly, their faces both familiar and foreign, and you sense they are guiding you towards something more than just a location.

Would you like me to continue the dream narrative, or is this a good stopping point?
