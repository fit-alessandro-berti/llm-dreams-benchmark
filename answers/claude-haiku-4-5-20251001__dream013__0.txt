# The Dream Continues...

...the puzzles become increasingly *impossible* to hold in your mind. 

You solve one and turn to move forward, but when you look back, the solution has vanished from your memory like water through fingers. You remember *knowing* it, but not *how* you knew.

The maze walls start breathing. Not threatening—just... breathing. And you realize the puzzles aren't locked by logic anymore. They're locked by emotion. The next door requires you to feel something specific, but you can't manufacture it. You stand before it for an hour or a second (time feels negotiable here), frustrated and sad that you can't just *think* your way through.

Then you notice something strange: other people are walking through the walls themselves. They're not solving puzzles at all. When you call out to ask them how, they turn and smile, but their answer comes as a color, not words. 

You're suddenly unsure whether you ever wanted to escape the maze, or whether you're supposed to become it. Your hand touches a wall and it's warm—*alive*—and you realize you've been inside the maze so long that its confusion has become comfortable.

The next corridor splits into infinite directions, each one equally possible...

*What do you choose?*
