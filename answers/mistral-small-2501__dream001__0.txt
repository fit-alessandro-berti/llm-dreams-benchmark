walk down the bustling streets, the city around you a mix of familiar and unfamiliar architecture. The buildings are tall and imposing, yet there's a strange, timeless quality to them. You check your pocket for any clues and find a small, worn-out piece of paper with an address scribbled on it: "37 Maplewood Lane."

You look around for a map or someone who can help. A nearby kiosk catches your eye, but it's not manned, instead it's a digital display that seems to respond to your presence. You tap on the screen and type in the address. The map pops up, but the city layout is different from what you're used to, with winding streets and no clear grid pattern. The kiosk suggests taking the nearest tram, which is just a block away.

You hurry towards the tram station, your heart pounding with a mix of excitement and anxiety. The tram is sleek and modern, and you notice that it runs without any tracks on the ground. You hop on, and as the tram starts to move, you see the cityscape change rapidly from towering skyscrapers to quaint, tree-lined streets. The air is crisp and fresh, and you feel a sense of calm washing over you.

As you approach Maplewood Lane, the tram slows down, and you step off. The lane is a quiet, residential street lined with vibrant gardens and well-kept houses. You walk up to number 37, a charming cottage with a white fence and a beautifully manicured lawn. The door is slightly ajar, and you can hear soft music coming from inside.

You push the door open and enter a warm, inviting room. There's a table set with two chairs, and on it, a single rose sits in a vase. You glance at your watch—there are only five minutes left until your meeting. Just as you sit down, a figure walks in from another room. It's someone you recognize, but they seem different and you can't quite place who they are.

The person smiles at you, and says, "Welcome. I've been expecting you."

What does the person do next?
