...grip the wheel tightly, feeling the ship groan beneath the relentless waves. The wind howls like a vengeful spirit, and the rain stings your face as you squint into the darkness. Your crew’s eyes are wide with fear, but you stand firm, your voice cutting through the storm’s fury.

**"Hold fast!"** you command, your voice steady despite the chaos. **"We ride this out together!"**

Suddenly, a monstrous wave looms over the ship, threatening to swallow it whole. Time slows as you brace yourself—but then, a strange light flickers on the horizon. A ghostly ship, its sails tattered yet glowing with an eerie luminescence, cuts through the storm toward you. At its helm stands a figure cloaked in mist, their voice echoing like thunder:

**"You are not lost yet, Captain. Follow me."**

The spectral ship turns sharply, carving a path through the storm’s heart. Your crew gasps, but you don’t hesitate. **"Full sail ahead!"** you roar, steering your vessel into the wake of the phantom guide.

The storm rages on, but the ghostly ship leads you through the tempest’s eye—and just as suddenly as it appeared, the storm breaks. The sea calms, the sky clears, and the spectral ship vanishes into the dawn, leaving only a single, shimmering compass in its wake.

Your crew cheers, but you stare at the compass, its needle spinning wildly before settling on a course no map has ever shown. The dream lingers as you wonder: *Where does it lead? And why was I chosen to follow?*

(Would you like to explore the next part of the dream?)
