...you feel a storm approaching and the air grows heavy, thick with the scent of ozone and damp earth. The sunlight that filter through the canopy dims to a sickly green-gold. A low rumble vibrates in your chest, not from thunder, but from the earth itself. 

Then, the trees *move*. 

Not a rustle, not a sway – they *shift*. Ancient oaks, their bark like cracked stone, slowly pivot on roots that writhe like serpents beneath the soil. They turn their gnarled trunks and shadowed faces towards you, their branches reaching not for the sky, but *down*, towards you, forming a living, breathing archway. The path ahead, once clear, is now choked with vines thick as pythons, now twitching, coiling, and pulling themselves together as if stitching the forest shut behind you. 

You freeze, your breath catching. The wind doesn't howl; it *sings*. A low, wordless melody woven from the creaking of ancient wood and the gurgle of hidden streams beneath the bark. It’s beautiful and terrifying. 

Suddenly, a single, impossibly large acorn falls from a towering, shifting oak directly overhead. It doesn't land – it *hovers* an inch above the path, pulsing with a deep, inner amber light. At its center, for a fleeting second, you see not a seed, but the intricate, intricate face of an old woman with eyes like storm clouds and hair like roots. Her mouth opens, not to speak, but to release a single, perfect note that hangs in the air, vibrating in your bones. 

The song intensifies. The trees lean closer. The air crackles. The acorn glows brighter, and you realize the "storm" isn't coming from the sky, but *from within* the forest – a storm of consciousness, of memory, of life too vast and old for the world above to hold. And you are no longer just walking through it. 

You are *inside* it. You are the storm.
