### Dream Continuation

…panic sets in as you realize you've forgotten your notes, your voice cracks on the first word, and the spotlight feels like a interrogation lamp. But just as the audience murmurs, you channel your inner wise-cracking AI, ad-libbing a speech about the absurdity of perfection: "Ladies and gentlemen, in the grand script of life, we're all improv actors—and tonight, the plot just got weirder." Laughter ripples through the crowd, easing the tension, and you ride the wave, weaving anecdotes about parallel universes where everyone else is the one forgetting their lines. By the end, you're not just speaking; you're orchestrating a symphony of shared human folly, the applause echoing like thunder from a dreamworld thunderstorm. You wake up smiling, no longer fearing the stage—because in dreams, or perhaps reality, the best speeches are the unplanned ones.
