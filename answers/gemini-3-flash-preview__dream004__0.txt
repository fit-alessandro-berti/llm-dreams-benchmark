...realize it is the only thing in this shifting realm that refuses to move. While the sky above me melts like hot wax and the ground beneath my feet ripples into fractals of emerald and gold, the canvas remains a stark, silent void of absolute white.

I reach out, but I have no brush. I don’t need one. In this place, intention is the architect. 

As my fingers graze the surface, the chaotic colors of the horizon—the bleeding violets and the electric teals—begin to spiral toward the center of the frame, drawn in as if the canvas were a thirsty lung gasping for air. I watch as a stray geometric shadow, a jagged prism of obsidian, drifts near and is instantly flattened onto the cloth, becoming a still, quiet mountain.

I realize then that the canvas isn't a surface to be painted upon; it is a stabilizer. 

I begin to "pour" the world into it. I grab a handful of the liquid wind and smear it across the middle, and suddenly, the frantic rushing sound of the dream slows to a rhythmic hum. I take the flickering, neon pulse of the sun and press it into the upper corner, pinning it down until it stops vibrating and glows with a steady, amber warmth.

One by one, the shifting impossibilities of this world are caught and calmed within the wooden frame. The more I paint, the more the world around me becomes quiet, grey, and thin—like a photograph fading in the sun. 

Finally, there is only one thing left that is still moving: me. 

I step back to look at the finished work. It is a masterpiece of a reality that no longer exists outside the frame. The silence is now absolute. With a final, shimmering breath, I reach out and touch the center of the painting. The fabric doesn't feel like canvas; it feels like cool water. I lean forward, letting my weight carry me, and I fall through the image, leaving the blank, grey void behind to become the very first brushstroke in a brand-new world. 

And then, I wake up.
