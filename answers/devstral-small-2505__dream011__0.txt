...written in a language you've never seen before. The symbols are intricate and swirling, like a mix of ancient hieroglyphs and alien script. Panic starts to rise within you, but you take a deep breath and try to focus.

Suddenly, a small, glowing creature appears on your desk. It's about the size of a mouse, with iridescent wings and eyes that sparkle like stars. It looks at you, tilts its head, and then starts to hover over the exam paper. As it moves, the symbols begin to change, transforming into words you can understand.

The creature looks at you again, as if waiting for your response. You nod, grateful for its help, and start to read the questions. They're still challenging, but now you can at least understand them. You begin to write your answers, the creature occasionally fluttering over to correct a mistake or offer a hint.

As you finish the last question, the creature bows to you, then disappears. You look around the exam room, but no one else seems to have noticed it. You hand in your paper, feeling a mix of relief and wonder. As you leave the room, you notice a small, glowing feather on the ground. You pick it up, tucking it into your pocket as a reminder of your strange helper.

You walk out of the exam room, the sun shining brightly, and you can't help but smile. Whatever happens next, you know this dream will stay with you.
