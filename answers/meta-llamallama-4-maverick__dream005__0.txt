...and they're all talking and laughing, but as I approach, they suddenly stop and stare at me. I feel a surge of awkwardness and try to smile, but it's like they're seeing right through me. I scan the room, hoping to catch a glimpse of the one person I know, but they're nowhere to be found.

I weave through the crowds, apologizing as I bump into people, and make my way to the bar. As I wait to order a drink, I notice a group of people gathered around a large, ornate mirror. They're all admiring their reflections and making adjustments to their outfits. I feel a pang of self-consciousness and check my own appearance, smoothing out my clothes and running a hand through my hair.

As I'm about to order, I hear a faint whisper in my ear. "Psst, over here." I turn to see a familiar face - it's the one person I know, hiding behind a pillar and grinning at me mischievously. I feel a wave of relief and make my way over to them, but just as I'm about to reach them, the room is filled with a loud, jarring noise...

(Suddenly, the scene shifts and I'm in a completely different setting. The social gathering is gone, and I'm standing in a dark, quiet hallway. The one person I knew is still with me, but now we're walking together, trying to find a way out. The dream is getting more surreal by the minute...)

Do you want me to continue?
