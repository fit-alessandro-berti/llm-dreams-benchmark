Alright, so I'm having this dream where I'm in the middle of a heated argument with one of my closest friends. It's weird because in dreams, things can get pretty intense, but at the same time, it feels surreal. Anyway, the disagreement is about something really important to both of us, and I can feel my heart racing just thinking about it.

First, I need to set the scene. In the dream, we're sitting in a coffee shop—this cozy little place that we both love. There are usually soft piano tunes playing in the background, but right now, all I can hear is the white noise of other customers chatting and the occasional clinking of cups. The usual warm atmosphere feels chilly and distant because of the tension between us.

So, the argument is about a decision my friend made that I think is really risky. It's about career choices, actually. My friend has this passion for starting their own business, but I think it's too unstable, especially given our current economic climate. I'm more of a planner; I like security and stability. My friend, on the other hand, is all about taking chances and following dreams.

In the dream, I start by expressing my concerns. "I just don't think this is the right time," I say, staring into my cup of coffee, trying to gather my thoughts. My friend looks up from their laptop, eyes narrowing slightly. "What do you mean? I've been researching this for months, and I feel like now is the perfect time," they reply, a hint of defensiveness in their voice.

I take a deep breath, trying to keep calm. "I know you've put a lot of thought into it, but have you considered the risks? The market is unpredictable right now, and starting a business requires a lot of capital. Where are you going to get the funds?" I ask, looking directly at them.

My friend shifts in their seat, crossing their arms. "I have a business plan, and I'm looking into investors. Besides, life's too short to play it safe all the time. Sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith," they say, emphasizing the last part.

I can feel my blood pressure rising. "Leap of faith? This isn't some adventure movie, Sam. This is real life, and mistakes can cost a lot more than just time and money," I counter, using my friend's name.

Sam—it sounds strange saying their name like that. In dreams, people's names can feel distant, like you're referring to someone you barely know. But in reality, Sam is one of my best friends; we've known each other since college.

Anyway, back to the dream. Sam shakes their head. "I get where you're coming from, but you're not me. You have a different perspective because of your background. I need to do this for myself," they say, almost pleadingly.

I lean forward, resting my elbows on the table. "Look, I just don't want to see you get hurt. I care about you, and I think you're better off sticking with a stable job for now. At least until things settle down," I suggest.

Sam sighs heavily, rubbing their temples as if they have a headache. "I appreciate your concern, but this is something I need to do. I can't keep living my life based on what could happen. I need to take control of my future," they say firmly.

I open my mouth to reply, but nothing comes out. Part of me understands where Sam is coming from; I've always admired their entrepreneurial spirit. But another part of me is scared for them, worried about the uncertainty ahead.

Just then, the barista calls out Sam's name, and they jump up to get their order. While they're away, I stare at my reflection in the window, seeing a strained version of myself. In dreams, people often look different—or maybe it's just that the dream version of me is reflecting my inner turmoil.

When Sam returns, they slide a latte towards me. "Here, you looked like you could use this," they say softly.

I manage a weak smile. "Thanks." We fall into an uneasy silence, each lost in our own thoughts.

After a while, I decide to change the subject. "So, have you heard from Jane lately?" I ask, referring to another mutual friend.

Sam looks surprised by the sudden shift but answers nonetheless. "Not recently. She was supposed to call last week, but maybe she's been busy."

We chat about Jane for a bit, and the tension eases slightly. But I can tell that the original issue is still hanging in the air, unresolved.

As the dream progresses, we start packing up to leave. Sam looks at me, eyes serious. "Promise me you'll support me, no matter what happens," they say, voice barely above a whisper.

I hesitate, biting my lip. Part of me wants to agree wholeheartedly, but another part is still apprehensive. Finally, I nod slowly. "Of course, Sam. No matter what, I'll be here for you."

Sam smiles"Thanks, friend. That means a lot to me."

Sam——
