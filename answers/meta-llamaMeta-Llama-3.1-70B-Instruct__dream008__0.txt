...start to feel a sense of panic rising up inside me. I look around the office, but everything seems fuzzy and distant, like I'm viewing it through a thick haze. My coworkers are all staring at me, their faces twisted into expectant grins, as if they're all in on some secret joke that I don't understand.

I try to speak, to ask my boss for clarification on the project, but my voice comes out in a faint whisper that no one seems to hear. I clear my throat and try again, but this time my words come out in a jumbled mess of sentences that make no sense.

Suddenly, the office around me begins to warp and distort, like it's being reflected in a funhouse mirror. The walls seem to be closing in on me, and the air grows thick with an unseen pressure that makes my head spin.

I turn back to my boss, who's still standing in front of me, a look of growing impatience on his face. He starts to speak, but his words are drowned out by the sound of ticking clocks, growing louder and more insistent with every passing moment.

I raise my hands, trying to ward off the feeling of panic that's building inside me, but they're made of lead, weighing me down and making it impossible to move. The clocks are getting louder, the words are becoming clearer... "90 minutes... 90 minutes... 90 minutes"...

Everything goes dark, and I feel myself falling, falling, falling into a vortex of impossible deadlines and crushing responsibility.
