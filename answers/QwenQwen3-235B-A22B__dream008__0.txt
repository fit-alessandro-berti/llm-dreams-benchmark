Suddenly, the fluorescent lights above flicker violently, casting jagged shadows across your desk. Your boss’s face melts into a pixelated blur, their voice echoing like a distorted alarm clock: *“You have until the moon phases backward. Begin.”* The keyboard under your fingers warps into a slab of ice, each keystroke hissing and cracking as frost crawls toward your wrists. Panic surges—your inbox overflows with emails from clients who are now faceless mannequins, their requests bleeding into the walls in smudged ink.  

You glance at the clock: **3:07 AM**. But outside the window, the sun is *rising**, then *setting*, then rising again, each cycle lasting three seconds. Your chair begins to sink into the floor, molasses-like, as colleagues around you morph into statues of salt, their eyes wide and accusatory.  

You scramble to your feet, only to find your project folder now contains a live hummingbird, its wings beating so fast they tear tiny holes in reality. Through one hole, you glimpse a version of yourself already finished, sipping coffee calmly in a parallel universe. You reach for it—but the hole snaps shut, leaving your hand coated in glittering starlight.  

Then, a revelation: you’re dreaming. You pinch your wrist, but the pain anchors you deeper. The boss’s distorted voice crescendos: *“Deadlines are lies. Wake up.”* You slam your fist on the desk—or try to—but your arm becomes a rope of seaweed, thrashing uselessly.  

The room collapses into a tunnel of static. You’re falling, then floating, then standing in your childhood kitchen, where your mother hands you a sandwich made of clock hands. *“Eat,”* she says. *“Time is digestion.”*  

You wake up at your desk, drooling on a half-finished spreadsheet. The boss looms, now human again, holding a lukewarm coffee. *“You okay?”* they ask. *“You looked… stressed.”* The screen reads **3:07 PM**. The hummingbird tweets softly in your peripheral vision, wings still spinning.
