track the sound of a distant, rhythmic traffic hum, it guiding you down narrow, winding streets lined with tall iron bridges and buildings wrapped in neon colors. As you push open a half-offened door into a cramped, cluttered office—the kind that smells of old paper and ambition—a uniformed guard bows slightly. “You’re not here for the usual sign,” they say in a trotting accent. “Find the yellow light in the northern wing. The meeting is hidden between the mannequins—waiting for someone with less certainty of direction than you.”  

You charge toward the neon-lit twilight, slipping past booming music from an unseen club, the glow of holographic screens flickering like fireflies. The guard gives you a sideways glance, almost knowing, and whispers, *“They say time bends here. But you—you got a compass in your mind.”*  

Before you turn, a flash of light catches in your eye—a nod. And then:  

**The hour strikes.**  

The door to the mannequins blinks open alone, revealing a room where *you’re* standing, and a single chair awaits, albeit without a seat beside it. In the air, a faint trace of a warm, familiar place lingers—your childhood bedroom, salved by years of dream humor.  

You sit down, hand hovering.  

**The real meeting begins.**  

Why the confusion? Because—  

**You’re the person who failed to book it, but your subconscious? Bigger.**  

The real world notices your dream. A message pops up on your wrist: *“It’s time. Are you coming?”*  

The hour is ticking. Your mind races.  

--- Northward. Again.  
The guard’s proof in the dust on their boot. Time’s tight.  

But what’s the meeting?  

A truth check. A confession. A debt.  
Or…  

The real truth? The city has never been a real city. It’s a test.  
And you’re still disappointed you didn’t realize you could’ve just *known* where to go.  

The meeting’s here.  
And if you move forward—  
The city might just bow to your doubt.  

**Open your eyes. Or let the dream close.**  

Either way, it’s different.
