walk through the bustling streets, the towering buildings stretching far above you, their sharp lines and glass facades reflecting the pale sunlight. The city feels both modern and ancient at the same time, with sleek tech shops nestled beside old stone buildings, and strange, winding alleyways that seem to loop back on themselves.

You pull out your phone, hoping to check the address, but it’s dead—completely unresponsive, as if it’s been drained of all power. Frustration builds as you scan the area, unsure where to turn next. People walk past you, absorbed in their own worlds, but no one seems to notice your confusion.

You pass by a small café, and for a moment, the aroma of fresh coffee fills the air. You hesitate, drawn to it, but the clock in your mind ticks louder. The meeting. You can't miss it. But where is it? Your anxiety starts to rise, and you wonder if you've somehow entered a parallel world where time and space don't behave the way you expect.

Turning a corner, you spot a large, ornate door with glowing symbols etched into it, almost calling you. There's something about it that feels significant, like it might hold the answers you need. But before you can take another step, a figure appears from the shadows—a person in a cloak, their face obscured.

They speak softly, their voice carrying an odd calmness, "You will find what you're looking for, but it won't be in the place you expect."

You’re not sure if you should follow this cryptic advice or keep searching on your own, but the city around you seems to be shifting with each passing moment. The sound of footsteps fades, and the glow of streetlights flickers as if the city itself is alive, watching, waiting for your decision.
