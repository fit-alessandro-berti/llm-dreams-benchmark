…you encounter various groups of people and each one seems to be hosting a different version of the same party.

In the first room, everyone is laughing too loudly at jokes that haven’t been told yet. Their mouths move a half-second behind the sound, like a badly dubbed film. Someone in a glittering jacket catches your eye and says your name as if they’ve been waiting for you, then hands you a cup filled with something that looks like starlight. When you blink, it’s just water, and when you look back up the person has joined a circle that has already forgotten you were there.

You move through an archway that wasn’t there a moment ago and find a long table where people are carefully folding paper into tiny animals. They don’t look up. Each time you pass, one of the animals lifts its head and follows you with its eyes. A woman with a pen behind her ear pushes a sheet toward you as if you’re late on an assignment. The paper is covered in your handwriting—lists of things you meant to do, names of people you’ve half-forgotten, and a sketch of your friend’s face, only the eyes are blank. You feel a small pulse of panic, then the paper folds itself into a bird and flutters away through a crack in the ceiling.

Across the hall, music seeps from a room lit entirely by aquariums. The bass thumps like a heartbeat under water. People sway as if they’re suspended, their hair floating around their faces. When you step inside, the air becomes thick and cool, and you can’t tell whether you’re breathing or holding your breath. Somewhere among the silhouettes you see someone with the same posture as the person you came looking for. You push forward, apologizing, but your voice comes out in bubbles. By the time you reach them, they turn—and it’s only a coat hanging on a chair, nodding gently to the rhythm.

You back away and end up in a hallway that loops like a ribbon. Every door you open leads to the same coat closet. The coats are all yours, in styles you’ve never owned. Pockets bulge with unfamiliar objects: a train ticket with your name printed wrong, a key that doesn’t fit your own front door, a photograph of you at the party standing next to the friend you can’t find. The photo is warm, as if it’s just been taken. You flip it over, and in neat block letters it reads: **STOP LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD.**

So you stop. You lean against the wall and let your eyes soften, taking in the whole scene without picking at it. The hallway seems to widen when you stop chasing it. In the soft edge of your vision, a shadow moves—not across the floor, but across the ceiling. You tilt your head back and see a staircase that climbs downward, each step labeled with a year you vaguely remember, and some you don’t.

You descend.

The air changes. The noise of the party above becomes muffled, like someone else’s memory. The walls are lined with framed conversations—snatches of dialogue hung like art. When you walk past, the words rearrange themselves into new sentences. A laugh track rises and falls. Somewhere in the distance, a familiar laugh cuts through all of it: the person you came here with, the only anchor you have. You follow it the way you might follow a scent.

The staircase ends in a room that looks nothing like the party: a quiet kitchen, lights low, a single window showing night. On the table sits a cake with no writing, as if the occasion hasn’t been decided yet. Your friend is there, finally, perched on the counter with their feet swinging, holding two mismatched plates. They look exactly like themselves and also slightly unfinished, as if the dream is still rendering them.

“You’re late,” they say, not unkindly.

“I’ve been looking everywhere,” you reply, and the relief in your own voice surprises you.

They nod like they expected that. “Everyone always looks everywhere. No one checks the place people go when they’re tired of being seen.”

You want to ask what that means, but the kitchen clock ticks too loudly, each tick a little shove. Your friend slides off the counter and sets one plate in front of you. On it is a slice of cake that tastes, without you even taking a bite, like the exact feeling you’ve been trying not to feel all week. You swallow anyway.

“Why didn’t you just text me?” you ask, because it’s what you would say in waking life.

They hold up a phone. The screen is dark, but you can see your own reflection in it, distorted slightly, like a funhouse mirror. “No signal down here,” they say. “Besides, you needed to walk through it.”

“Through what?”

They gesture vaguely upward, toward the party that might be a building or might be your brain. “All those rooms you made.”

Your stomach drops. “I made them?”

They shrug. “You make a lot of things. Most of them are for other people.”

Before you can argue, the window over the sink brightens as if dawn is arriving too fast. But when you look closer, it isn’t dawn. It’s the party lights bleeding through, a bright tide rising. You hear the crowd above, suddenly louder, as if the ceiling has thinned to tissue paper.

Your friend leans in, voice lowered. “You can’t stay here long. This is the part where you wake up.”

“No,” you say automatically, and it comes out like a plea. “I just found you.”

“I know.” Their expression softens. “That’s why it ends.”

They reach for your hand. Their palm is warm and real. For a moment, the whole kitchen steadies—as if this touch is a pin holding the dream to the corkboard of your mind.

“Before you go,” they say, “tell me what you were actually looking for.”

It’s a trick question, you think. It’s not them; it’s the comfort of not being alone. It’s the reassurance that you belong at the party, that you didn’t arrive by mistake. It’s the sentence that fixes the awkwardness of being a stranger among strangers.

But under all of that, there’s something simpler and heavier.

“I wanted someone to see me,” you admit.

Your friend nods, as if that’s the only honest answer in the room. “I see you,” they say.

The kitchen light flickers. The party noise surges. The cake collapses into a pile of flour that lifts into the air and drifts like snow. The framed conversations on the walls shake themselves loose and scatter, words fluttering like moths.

Your friend squeezes your hand once—tight, precise, like a punctuation mark.

“Next time,” they say, “try looking for yourself first.”

And then the entire scene pulls away from you like a tablecloth snapped clean: the kitchen, the staircase, the looping hallway, the aquarium room, the paper birds—gone in a single smooth motion.

You’re back at the gathering, standing in the doorway where you started, holding an empty cup.

Across the room, through the shifting crowd, you catch sight of someone you recognize. They turn at the exact moment you look up, as if they felt your gaze like a tap on the shoulder.

It’s your friend.

They lift their hand in a small wave, perfectly ordinary, perfectly real.

And just as you begin to walk toward them, you wake up with the sensation of their warm palm still on yours, and the lingering question—quiet but insistent—hovering in your mind like a note you’re supposed to remember: **What were you actually looking for?**
