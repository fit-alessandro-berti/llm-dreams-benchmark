I can continue this dream scenario:

You are about to give a speech to a large audience. As you step onto the stage, you see the crowd looking expectantly at you, and you begin to float upward, slowly rising above the podium. At first, you panic, grabbing at the microphone to anchor yourself, but it transforms into a colorful butterfly in your hand. The audience doesn't seem alarmed - instead, they too begin to gently rise from their seats, like leaves caught in a warm breeze.

The ceiling of the auditorium dissolves into a starlit sky, and your speech notes are now glowing constellation patterns that dance before your eyes. Words flow from your mouth as shimmering ribbons of light, weaving through the floating audience members who sway like seaweed in an invisible current. You feel simultaneously terrified and exhilarated, speaking a language that isn't quite English but that everyone somehow understands perfectly.

Would you like me to continue with this dream sequence?
