You are feeling lost and alone in a bustling city. Suddenly, a group of kind strangers offers to help you find your way, and you gratefully accept, following them through neon-lit alleys alive with laughter and street musicians. They lead you to a hidden rooftop garden blooming with impossible flowers—glowing orchids that whisper forgotten secrets. As you sip shimmering tea from porcelain cups that refill themselves, the strangers reveal their true forms: shimmering guardians of the city's dreams, each one a fragment of your own forgotten hopes. One hands you a golden key etched with your name, unlocking a door in the sky that spirals open to reveal your true home—a floating library where every book tells the story of lives you could live. You step through, weightless and whole, the city's chaos fading into a symphony of stars, and wake with the key still warm in your palm.
