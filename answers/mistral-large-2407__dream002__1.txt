As the first few raindrops begin to fall, you notice the wind picking up, whispering through the leaves with an urgent rustle. The once bright sky darkens rapidly, casting eerie, shifting shadows on the forest floor. You can feel the electric charge in the air, and the hairs on your arms stand up as a low rumble of thunder echoes in the distance.

You quicken your pace, seeking shelter, when you spot a hidden path leading to a small, quaint cottage nestled among the trees. The cottage seems to beckon you, promising warmth and safety from the impending storm. As you approach, you notice smoke curling from the chimney and a soft, inviting light glowing from the windows.

Just as you reach the door, a brilliant flash of lightning illuminates the sky, followed by a deafening crack of thunder. You hastily knock on the door, and it creaks open slowly, revealing a cozy interior filled with the aroma of freshly baked bread and the comforting sound of a crackling fire.

To your surprise, no one seems to be home. You tentatively step inside, the storm now raging outside, and explore the cottage. Each room is filled with curiosities and trinkets that seem to tell a story. As you run your fingers over the spines of old books and examine peculiar artifacts, you hear a soft melody playing from an unseen source.

Following the music, you discover a hidden room behind a bookshelf. Inside, a beautiful, antique music box sits on a pedestal, its delicate tune filling the air. As you approach the music box, the storm outside seems to grow quieter, and the room fills with a warm, golden light. You reach out to touch the music box, and as your fingers make contact, the dream shifts, and you find yourself in a new, enchanting landscape, the storm and the cottage left behind...

Where would you like the dream to go from here?
