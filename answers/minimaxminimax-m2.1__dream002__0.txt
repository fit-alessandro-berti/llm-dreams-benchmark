# The Gathering Storm

You feel the shift before you see it. The air grows heavy, thick with the taste of copper and distant thunder. Leaves that were moments ago trembling in a gentle breeze now hold still, as if the forest itself is holding its breath.

The sky transforms above the canopy—pale lavender giving way to an unnatural darkness that seeps in from the edges. You quicken your pace along the moss-covered path, but the forest seems to shift around you, familiar landmarks bending into strange configurations. The trees grow taller, their bark darker, ancient faces emerging from the grain of wood that you swear weren't there before.

A flash of lightning illuminates the path ahead—not white, but a deep violet that casts everything in ethereal shadow. The thunder that follows isn't a crash, but a voice. Or many voices. They speak in a language you don't understand but somehow feel in your bones.

Rain begins to fall. Not drops, but threads of silver that descend through the canopy in slow motion, as if time itself has grown viscous. Each droplet hums with a faint light, and where they touch the forest floor, small flowers bloom instantaneously—luminescent petals in colors that have no name.

You realize you're no longer afraid. The storm isn't something to survive—it's something to witness. The forest has transformed into a place between worlds, and you are standing at the threshold of something vast and ancient and impossibly beautiful.

The voices in the thunder grow clearer. They are asking you a question.
