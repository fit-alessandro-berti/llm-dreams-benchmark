dreams to reach it, but I must keep going despite all obstacles.

As the final showdown approaches, everything seems uncertain because I've entered multiple levels of what could be considered my "dream worlds." Each level is made up of different terrains that test each area of your life: family, relationships, career, health, education, and more. Each obstacle you overcome in one dream world makes it to the next one, requiring even greater strength or creativity from you to reach each subsequent goal.

Finally, after overcoming all this by using skills I didn't know I had, I step onto the stage and see my dream job as an award-winning author right before my eyes. It looks beautiful but slightly out of touch with reality, given that I'm actually sitting down in a quiet café. Suddenly, it dawns on me - is this really just another dream world? After all my efforts to reach this dream, am I still dreaming?
