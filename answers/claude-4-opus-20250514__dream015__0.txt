...build a greenhouse from salvaged windows and twisted metal beams. The morning sun filters through cracked glass, casting rainbow patterns on rows of impossible plants that grow overnight - tomatoes with leaves that glow faintly blue, corn that whispers secrets when the wind blows through it.

A three-legged dog made of rust and starlight becomes your companion, leading you to hidden springs that bubble up with liquid memories. You drink deeply and suddenly remember how to play the violin, though you've never held one before.

At night, the old radio tower in the distance broadcasts lullabies in languages that died before the world ended. You climb it once and find a room at the top where gravity works sideways, where a kind old woman serves tea that tastes like tomorrow's rain.

The other survivors think you're mad for believing in hope, but your garden grows. Children start to visit, their eyes wide as they taste strawberries that giggle when picked. Soon, they're helping you plant seeds that fall from nowhere like snow.

In this dream, the apocalypse isn't an ending - it's soil for something strange and beautiful to grow.
