...find yourself following them through twisting alleys that seem to shift when no one’s looking. Their laughter hums like a melody you almost remember, and one of them hands you a map drawn in glowing ink—yet every time you glance down, the streets rearrange themselves, as if the city is alive and choosing your path.  

They don’t speak much, but their gestures are warm, deliberate. A woman with a cloak of starlight points to a bridge where the river flows upward into the clouds, and a man with a clock-shaped scar on his cheek taps his wrist, murmuring, “Time’s not what you think here.”  

As you walk, the loneliness begins to unravel, replaced by a curious trust. The city’s chaos softens into a rhythm—a heartbeat you can almost sync with. Then, abruptly, the group stops before a door embedded in the side of a building that looks like a giant’s forgotten puzzle. It’s slightly ajar, and from inside drifts the scent of rain-soaked jasmine and something metallic, like memory.  

The strangers step back, bowing in unison. “You’re already home,” the woman with the starlight cloak whispers. The door creaks open on its own, revealing a room filled with mirrors that don’t reflect you—but instead, fragments of lives you’ve forgotten or never lived.  

You step inside. The door clicks shut, but you’re no longer afraid. Somewhere, the city hums a lullaby, and you realize the strangers were never leading you *out* of the maze… they were leading you *into* yourself.
