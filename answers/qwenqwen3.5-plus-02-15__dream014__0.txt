...follow them down a narrow, cobblestone alley that seems to hum with a soft, golden light, distinct from the harsh neon of the main streets. As we walk, the cacophony of traffic and shouting fades into a gentle, melodic whisper, like wind chimes in a breeze.

The strangers don't speak your language, yet you understand them perfectly through their warm smiles and reassuring gestures. One of them, an elderly woman with eyes like polished river stones, hands you a small, glowing lantern. "This will show you not where you are going," she seems to say without words, "but where you belong."

As the lantern's light touches the ground, the shifting, confusing streets solidify into a familiar path leading to a cozy, open door filled with laughter and the scent of fresh bread. You realize with a sudden, swelling relief that you were never truly lost; you were just waiting for someone to remind you that you are part of something bigger. The fear dissolves, replaced by a profound sense of connection, and as you step through the doorway, the dream gently fades into a peaceful, dreamless sleep.
