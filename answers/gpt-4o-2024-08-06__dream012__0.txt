raise a hand to signal them to stay calm. The wind howls, and waves crash against the hull, but your voice cuts through the chaos. “Hold steady!” you shout, your words infused with confidence you weren't sure you possessed just moments ago.

The deck tilts as the ship rides up a massive wave. You adjust your footing, instinctively feeling the rhythm of the sea. Your crew mirrors your stance, trusting in your leadership. “Prepare to adjust the sails!” you command, aware that harnessing the storm’s energy wisely could be your best chance at navigating through it.

Lightning splits the sky, illuminating your surroundings for a brief second—enough to reveal an approaching rocky outcrop. “Starboard, hard!” you yell, and your first mate relays the order, hands moving quickly over the wheel.

With precision borne from years on the sea, the ship veers to the right, narrowly missing the jagged rocks. The crew works in a seamless ballet of motion, tightening ropes and trimming sails. The storm is relentless, yet a familiar adrenaline flows through you, sharpening your senses.

Through the haze of wind and rain, another vessel appears on the horizon. It’s struggling, its distress signals barely visible. You’ve faced dire moments before, yet the dilemma tugs at you—even in this storm, you must act.

“Ready the lifeboats!” you decide, yelling over the squall. The crew springs into action once more, united by a shared sense of duty, and you draw nearer to the other ship.

As you prepare to lend aid, a warmth spreads through your chest—a sense of purpose and camaraderie that only comes in such moments of connection and courage. The storm may rage on, but you know, alongside your crew, you'll chart a path through the tumultuous waters.

Suddenly, the scene starts to dissolve, the ocean's roar blends into a distant whisper, and you feel yourself waking. As the dream fades, a sense of accomplishment lingers, as if you truly had captained a ship through a stormy sea.
