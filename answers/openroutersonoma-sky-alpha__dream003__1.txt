...symbols that seem to shift and writhe like living vines under your fingertips. The patterns aren't just carved—they pulse with an otherworldly light, faint at first, like the glow of fireflies trapped in amber. Your heart races as you trace one of them, a spiraling rune that feels warm, almost alive, sending a shiver up your arm.

Suddenly, the box hums—a low, resonant vibration that echoes through your chest, syncing with your breath. You lean in closer, and the air around you thickens, turning hazy, as if the dream itself is bending. The symbols rearrange before your eyes, forming words in a language you don't recognize but somehow understand: "Unlock with your truth."

No key? That's the trick, isn't it? In this dream-logic world, you whisper your deepest secret into the lock—a childhood fear, a hidden wish, something raw and unspoken. The box trembles, then clicks open with a sigh, releasing a cascade of shimmering memories that swirl around you like autumn leaves in a whirlwind.

Inside lies not treasure, but a mirror. You peer in, and it's not your reflection staring back—it's a version of you from a life unlived, smiling knowingly. The dream fades as the mirror's edges blur, pulling you toward wakefulness. You jolt awake, the box's warmth lingering on your skin like a promise. What was that truth you shared? And will the box reappear in your next dream?
