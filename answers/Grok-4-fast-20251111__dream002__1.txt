You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and quicken your pace, the air thickening with the scent of ozone and wet earth. Leaves rustle like whispers of warning, and the canopy above fractures into a mosaic of silver-gray light as thunder rumbles in the distance—a low growl that vibrates through your bones.

You duck under a gnarled oak, its bark cool and ancient against your palm, but the first raindrops aren't water. They fall like liquid starlight, cool and effervescent, fizzing on your skin and leaving trails of glowing blue that pulse with your heartbeat. The storm isn't coming from the sky; it's rising from the ground, the forest floor bubbling up in iridescent pools that reflect not clouds, but fragments of forgotten memories—your childhood swing set creaking in the wind, a half-remembered lover's laugh, the taste of rain on a summer sidewalk.

Panic flickers, but curiosity wins. You step into one of the pools, and the world tilts. The trees warp into colossal hourglasses, sand cascading from branch to root in endless loops. Lightning cracks, not as destruction, but as laughter—jagged bolts that dance like fireflies drunk on moonlight, illuminating faces in the underbrush: a fox with your mother's eyes, a deer wearing your father's old watch, ticking backward.

The wind howls your name, pulling you deeper into the heart of the grove, where the storm converges into a single, swirling vortex of feathers and forgotten songs. You reach out, and it envelops you—not to consume, but to cradle. In that moment, the chaos quiets, revealing a hidden glade where the rain solidifies into crystal butterflies, fluttering around you in a silent symphony.

You wake with the echo of wings on your lashes, the forest's peace restored, but now you carry its wild secret: storms aren't endings; they're invitations to remember who you could become.
