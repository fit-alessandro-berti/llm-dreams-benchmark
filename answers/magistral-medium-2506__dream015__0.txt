**...build a sanctuary.**

You stumble upon an abandoned greenhouse, its glass panels cracked but still standing. The soil inside is dry but fertile, and you realize this could be the beginning of something greater. You gather scraps of metal, discarded tools, and seeds from hardy wild plants. With time and effort, you transform the space into a thriving garden, hidden behind reinforced walls.

Word spreads. Survivors with wary eyes and weary souls arrive, drawn by rumors of food and safety. At first, you hesitate—do you share what you’ve built, or protect it fiercely? But then you remember: in this broken world, kindness is the rarest resource of all.

You teach them how to replant, how to purify water, how to defend without becoming monsters. The sanctuary grows. It becomes a flicker of hope in the wasteland—a place where people don’t just survive, but remember what it means to live.

But then, one night, distant engines roar. Raiders or scavengers? The walls won’t hold forever. Do you fight? Flee? Or try one last gamble to save what you’ve built?
