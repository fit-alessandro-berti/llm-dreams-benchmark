Here is a completion of your dream:

...you encounter various groups of people and **their faces seem to shift and blur whenever you try to focus on them.**

One group is huddled around a table playing a game with cards that have no suits or numbers, just swirling colors. They invite you to join, but when you look at your hands, you realize you are holding a glass filled with a liquid that is glowing faintly blue. You try to set it down, but there is nowhere to put it.

Another group forms a circle around a man reciting a speech, but he isn't using his mouth; the sound seems to vibrate directly into your ears. As you get closer, the crowd parts, and suddenly you are standing in the center of the circle. Everyone turns to look at you expectantly. You open your mouth to say, "I'm just looking for my friend," but instead of words, music comes out. It is a beautiful, haunting melody that you have never heard before, yet you know all the words.

The guests begin to sway, and the floor beneath your feet turns into soft moss. You decide to run, sprinting past faces that look like your childhood teachers, your grandmother, and strangers you’ve seen on the bus. You are holding the glowing glass tight against your chest so you don't spill a drop, even though the ground is now rippling like water.

You see a door standing alone in the middle of the open air. You know that your friend is behind it. You reach for the handle, but just as your fingers brush the cold metal, you wake up.
