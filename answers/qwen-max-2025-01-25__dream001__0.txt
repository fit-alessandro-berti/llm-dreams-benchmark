panic, your heart racing as the towering skyscrapers and labyrinthine streets seem to close in around you. The city is alive with noise—honking cars, distant chatter, and the hum of electricity—but none of it feels familiar. You glance at your watch again: 50 minutes left.

You decide to retrace your steps mentally, trying to recall any clues about the meeting's location. A faint memory surfaces—a name, "The Obsidian Tower." It rings a bell, but you're not sure why. You pull out your phone, hoping for an email or calendar invite, but the screen remains stubbornly blank. No signal. Of course.

Feeling a mix of frustration and determination, you approach a nearby street vendor selling colorful fruits you've never seen before. "Excuse me," you say, "do you know where The Obsidian Tower is?" The vendor looks up, their eyes gleaming with curiosity. They point toward a distant cluster of shimmering glass buildings on the horizon. "That way," they say cryptically, "but beware the mirrors."

Mirrors? Before you can ask what they mean, the vendor turns back to their cart, dismissing you. You hesitate for a moment, then start walking briskly in the direction they indicated. As you weave through crowded streets, you notice something strange—the reflections in every window and mirror you pass seem... off. Your reflection doesn't quite match your movements. Sometimes it lags behind; other times, it smiles when you don’t.

Unease settles into your chest, but you press on. Time is slipping away. After several blocks, you come across a massive structure that dominates the skyline—a sleek, black tower that seems to absorb light rather than reflect it. This must be The Obsidian Tower. But as you step inside, the lobby is eerily empty. The walls are lined with floor-to-ceiling mirrors, each one distorting reality just slightly. In some, you appear taller; in others, younger—or older.

A soft voice echoes from somewhere unseen. "You're late." You spin around, searching for its source, but no one is there. Suddenly, a figure emerges from one of the mirrors. It’s you—but not you. This version wears a confident smirk and carries an air of authority. "I’ve been waiting," Mirror You says. "We need to talk."

Your mind races. Is this part of the dream? Or has the city itself become a puzzle you must solve?
