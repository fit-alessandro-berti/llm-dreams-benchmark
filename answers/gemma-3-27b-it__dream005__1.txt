...and each group seems to be engaged in a *very* specific, and slightly unsettling, hobby.

The ballroom was enormous, all glittering chandeliers and swirling gowns, but the music was…off. Not bad, exactly, but like a slightly warped record, perpetually on the verge of skipping. I was desperately scanning for Amelia, the one friend who’d dragged me to this “Annual Society of Curious Collectors” event. She’d promised it would be “interesting,” but hadn’t mentioned *how* interesting.

I rounded a cluster of velvet ropes and found myself face-to-face with a group meticulously arranging miniature porcelain teeth on a moss-covered diorama. They weren’t smiling, these collectors, their faces intensely focused as they debated the placement of a particularly chipped molar. One woman, with a magnifying glass perched on her nose, hissed, “No, no, the canine needs to be *slightly* more anterior. It’s all about the bite, darling, the bite!”

I mumbled an apology and hurried on, bumping into a man carrying a precarious tower of perfectly stacked, empty sardine cans. He didn’t even flinch, just continued his ascent, muttering about “structural integrity” and “the inherent beauty of tinned fish.”

Further on, a circle of people were intensely studying…belly button lint. Yes, you read that right. They had it displayed in tiny glass vials, categorized by color and texture. A man with a tweed jacket and a serious expression was lecturing on the “micro-ecosystems” thriving within each sample. I caught a snippet of his discourse: “…and as you can see, the navy blue specimen exhibits a remarkably high concentration of cotton fibers, suggesting a preference for flannel…”

Panic began to bubble in my chest. Where was Amelia? Was she even *here*? I spotted a flash of her bright red dress across the room and started to push through the crowd, only to be intercepted by a group engaged in competitive snail racing. They were cheering wildly as two snails, adorned with tiny, hand-painted shells, inched their way across a damp tablecloth. 

“Go Shelly! Go Shelly!” a woman shrieked, waving a miniature flag. 

I tried to explain I was looking for a friend, but my words were lost in the din. Then, one of the snail racers turned to me, a strange glint in his eye. “Looking for someone? Perhaps they’ve joined the Society for the Preservation of Lost Buttons? They’re in the west wing, meticulously cataloging them by shank type.”

Suddenly, the warped music seemed to swell, and the chandeliers began to sway. The room felt…smaller, more claustrophobic. I felt a hand on my shoulder and spun around, hoping it was Amelia. 

It wasn’t. 

It was a man holding a single, perfectly preserved butterfly, its wings shimmering with an unnatural luminescence. He smiled, a slow, unsettling smile. “Lost, are you? Don’t worry. Everyone gets lost in the collection eventually. Perhaps you’d like to contribute? We’re always looking for new specimens…”

And then, just as he offered me the butterfly, I woke up, heart pounding, with the distinct feeling that I needed to check my belly button.
