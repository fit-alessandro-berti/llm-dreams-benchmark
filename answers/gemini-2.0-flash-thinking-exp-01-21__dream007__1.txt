... **stop talking and just look at them.**

The words hung heavy in the air between you, unspoken accusations and simmering frustrations.  Your chest tightened with each breath, the argument a knot twisting in your stomach. But as you stared at your friend – really stared, past the heat of the moment, past the anger that contorted their features – something shifted within you.

The shouting seemed to fade into a muffled hum, like the sound of waves receding from the shore.  Their face, normally so familiar and comforting, seemed to blur slightly at the edges, as if the intensity of your emotions was distorting your perception.

And you decide to **reach out and touch their arm.**

It’s a hesitant gesture, tentative, unsure of how it will be received. But you can’t bear the chasm that has opened up between you, the cold space where warmth and understanding used to reside.

As your fingertips brush against their sleeve, a strange sensation washes over you. It’s not the immediate softening of anger you might expect. Instead, the room around you seems to shimmer, the colors deepening and swirling like paint in water. The argument, the specific *thing* you were disagreeing about, begins to feel distant, less important, like a fading echo.

Your friend’s eyes widen, not with anger anymore, but with a mixture of surprise and something akin to… confusion?  The tension in their shoulders seems to lessen, just a fraction, as if your touch has broken the spell of the argument.

And then, the walls of the room begin to dissolve, not literally crumbling, but becoming transparent, like shimmering curtains of light.  You see, not the familiar room you were just in, but a vast, star-dusted expanse opening up behind them.  Nebulae swirl in vibrant colours, distant galaxies glimmer like jewels, and a sense of infinite space and possibility unfolds around you both.

The argument, the disagreement, the *thing* that felt so monumental moments ago, suddenly shrinks to insignificance in the face of this cosmic vista.  It’s as if the intensity of your feelings, the raw emotion of the argument, has somehow peeled back the layers of reality to reveal something much larger, much more profound.

Your friend, no longer angry, but wide-eyed with wonder, turns to you, and in the silence of this dreamscape, you both understand, without needing words, that whatever you were arguing about, it doesn't matter here.  Here, in this boundless expanse of stars, what truly matters is the connection between you, the shared experience, the friendship that has somehow transcended the petty confines of your disagreement and opened up to something truly extraordinary.

The dream hangs there, suspended in the star-dusted silence, leaving you with a feeling of awe, and a quiet sense of relief. The argument is unresolved, perhaps, but in this dream, resolution feels less important than this unexpected, breathtaking journey you’ve just embarked on together.
