…accept their offer with a shy nod, still not quite trusting that this is real. The strangers (three of them, maybe four) smile like they’ve been waiting for me my whole life. One has silver hair that catches the neon lights, another wears a coat made of what looks like living moss, and the third keeps humming a tune I swear I’ve heard in childhood dreams I can’t remember waking from.

They lead me through alleys that twist like thoughts you don’t want to have, past shop windows displaying things that shouldn’t exist: clocks that run backward only when you’re happy, mirrors that show you five seconds into the future, a jar of bottled laughter that bubbles violently when I walk by.

We stop at a tiny door set into a brick wall that definitely wasn’t there a moment ago. The silver-haired one produces a key made of moonlight (no, really, it drips onto the pavement and evaporates) and unlocks it. Inside is not a room but an endless field under a sky full of multiple moons. The air smells like rain on warm pavement and the moment right before you cry from relief.

“You were never lost,” the moss-coated stranger says, voice soft as soil. “You just forgot you were already home, and the city was trying to remind you the long way around.”

I turn to thank them, but they’re already dissolving into fireflies (or maybe stars) that swirl up into the many-mooned sky. The last thing I feel before waking is one of them pressing something small and warm into my palm. When I open my eyes in the dark of my actual bedroom, my hand is clenched around nothing… but for the rest of the night, every time I almost fall back asleep, I swear I can hear that childhood melody again, gentle and patient, telling me the way.
