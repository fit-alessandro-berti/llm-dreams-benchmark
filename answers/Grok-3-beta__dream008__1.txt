feel a wave of panic wash over you. The office around you seems to warp, the walls bending inward as if they’re closing in. Your desk is piled high with papers, and your computer screen flickers with endless notifications, each one a reminder of the looming deadline. You try to speak, to tell your boss that the timeline is unreasonable, but your voice comes out as a whisper, barely audible over the ticking of a giant clock that has suddenly appeared on the wall, its hands spinning wildly.

Your boss, now towering over you, doesn’t seem to notice your distress. Their face is expressionless, almost like a mannequin’s, and they keep repeating, “It must be done. It must be done,” in a monotone voice that echoes unnaturally. You reach for the papers on your desk, but they slip through your fingers like sand, scattering across the floor. The more you try to gather them, the more they multiply, until you’re knee-deep in a sea of documents.

Suddenly, you notice your coworkers. They’re all sitting at their desks, but they’re not working. They’re staring at you, their eyes wide and unblinking, as if they’re waiting for something. One of them stands up and approaches you, but as they get closer, you realize it’s not a coworker—it’s you, or at least a version of you. This doppelgänger smiles, but it’s unsettling, too wide and too sharp. “You’ll never finish,” it says in your own voice, and the words sink into your chest like a heavy weight.

Desperate, you turn back to your computer, hoping to make some progress, but the screen now displays a countdown timer, ticking down from mere minutes. Your hands tremble as you type, but the keys keep changing places, and every word you write turns into gibberish. The clock on the wall chimes, a deafening sound that shakes the room, and the lights begin to flicker. You feel the ground beneath you shift, and when you look down, the floor is gone—replaced by a swirling void of darkness.

Just as you’re about to fall into the abyss, you hear a distant voice calling your name. It’s faint at first, but it grows louder, pulling you back. You turn toward the sound, and the office starts to dissolve around you. The papers, the clock, your eerie doppelgänger—they all fade into a blur. The voice becomes clearer, and you realize it’s someone familiar, someone safe. You reach out toward it, and as you do, you feel yourself being pulled upward, out of the chaos.

You wake up with a start, heart pounding, tangled in your bedsheets. The room is dark, save for the faint glow of streetlights filtering through the window. You take a deep breath, realizing it was just a dream, but the lingering sense of urgency still clings to you. As you lie there, trying to calm your racing thoughts, you can’t help but wonder if there’s a part of that impossible deadline—or that version of yourself—that’s still waiting for you somewhere in the back of your mind.
