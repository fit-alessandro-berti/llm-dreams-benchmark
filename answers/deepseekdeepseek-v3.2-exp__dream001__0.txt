...panic, but then you take a deep breath. The air smells of ozone and baking bread. You pat your pockets and find, not your phone, but a single, worn slip of paper. On it, in elegant script, is an address: "The Sundial at the Heart of the Labyrinth."

As you look up, the city shifts. The skyscrapers aren't just steel and glass; they are woven from light and memory, their surfaces flickering with half-remembered faces and forgotten songs. The streets below are not laid out in a grid, but spiral out from a central point you can feel more than see.

A clock tower in the distance chimes, but the sound is visual—ripples of gold pulse through the air with each bong. You know, with the unshakable certainty of a dream, that the meeting is not about business. It's about a secret you buried, a choice you never made, or a version of yourself you left behind.

You start to walk, not with the frantic energy of being lost, but with the deliberate pace of a pilgrim. The city responds to your intent. An alleyway that was a dead end moments ago now opens into a courtyard filled with silent, watching statues. A bridge made of whispers carries you over a river that flows with liquid starlight.

You are getting closer. You can feel it. The hum of the city is now a low, guiding thrum in your bones. People—or perhaps just ideas given form—drift past. One, a figure made of shifting mosaic tiles, points a shimmering hand toward a grand, arching gateway. Through it, you see a vast, open plaza.

And there, in the center, stands a magnificent sundial, its bronze face gleaming even though there is no sun, only a uniform, pearlescent glow from the sky.

You approach the sundial. As you get closer, you see a single figure waiting for you, their back turned. You know this person. It's you. A younger you, or an older you, or the you that could have been.

The figure turns. They don't speak, but they smile, and in that smile is everything you need to know. The meeting has begun.
