...and you realize with a jolt of lucidity that the wood beneath your feet is not creaking from the waves, but breathing. The ship is alive. 

You try to shout an order to lower the sails, but your voice doesn't carry. Instead, when you open your mouth, a flock of dark, iron-winged moths flies out, swirling into the gale. The crew doesn't flinch. They stand frozen at their posts, their faces waxen and smooth, devoid of features, yet you can feel their expectation pressing against your skin like a heavy wool blanket.

The storm above isn't made of clouds and rain anymore; it is a swirling vortex of old clock faces, their hands spinning wildly backward. Lightning strikes the deck, but it doesn't burn—it splashes like liquid gold, pooling around your boots. 

You grip the railing, intending to steer into the wave, but the railing softens in your hands, turning into thick, green vines that instantly bloom with phosphorescent flowers. You look out at the churning sea and see that the water has turned to glass. Through the transparent surface, you see a vast, dusty library far below, lit by a single, swinging bulb. 

The storm isn't trying to sink you; it’s trying to show you something. You take a deep breath, the air tasting of ozone and burning sugar, and step off the edge of the ship, falling slowly, gently, down toward the books, as the crew of faceless men applauds silently in the rain.
