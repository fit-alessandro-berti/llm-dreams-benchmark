…run, but the streets keep folding, rerouting themselves like a map trying to remember its own directions. Buildings lean in to confer, swapping facades, exchanging window patterns like masks at a masquerade. You check your phone and it displays a language made of miniature constellations, each blinking syllable drifting apart before you can read it. Your calendar pings and releases a flock of paper cranes that scatter through the alleys.

A taxi idles at the curb with no driver. You climb in and the meter reads “North of Here.” The car glides forward, then sideways, then backward in time until the sunlight is different—older, rounder. Out the window, streets become long library aisles, and every door is the spine of a book. You choose one at random, push, and enter a park paved with old conversations. Children skip rope with sentences you half-remember. A fountain coughs up pocket watches like silver fish; one leaps into your hand and refuses to tick.

You ask a passerby where the meeting is. He looks up, surprised to find himself a statue, and points with a marble finger to a staircase that climbs the sky. You take it two at a time, breathless, and emerge onto a rooftop where clouds are spread like tablecloths. Your shoes collect dew that whispers your name in Morse code. A wind unravels itself and becomes a woman with an envelope. She hands it to you; your name is written in your handwriting.

Inside is a map you drew as a child of a city that never existed, folded around a single key of impossible weight. The map shows a red X at the intersection of Memory and Promise. You hold it up to the sun and the paper turns transparent; beneath it, the city aligns, block for block. You can see the route now, straight as a thrown thought.

You run, and the city runs with you. Walls give way, doors step aside, the horizon moves closer like an elevator arriving. On the corner, a clocktower peals a note so low it gathers dust out of the air and shapes it into a hallway. You go down it, and the floorboards remember every footstep you’ve ever taken, playing them back in rhythm. At the end, a mirror stands, freckled with old rain.

You look into it and see a conference room filled with chairs, each occupied by a version of yourself wearing different choices. They turn in unison, expectant. The chair at the head of the table is empty and warm, as if you’ve just stood up. You touch the glass. It isn’t cold at all. It pushes back like the surface of a lake, a give and a welcome.

You step through, the room smelling faintly of citrus and midnight. The other yous nod, relieved, as if they were worried you wouldn’t arrive in time. A chalkboard at the far end reads: Agenda—Locate yourself. Someone laughs—the sound is very kind—and you realize it was you, from a seat you haven’t sat in yet. You sit. The key in your pocket grows light, almost weightless.

“Let’s begin,” you say, and the city outside leans closer to listen. The paper cranes gather at the windowsill, folding themselves into minutes, the hour becoming patient in your hands. The meeting is exactly where you are, and it starts the moment you decide it does. Somewhere, distant but audible, a fountain finally finds its tick.
