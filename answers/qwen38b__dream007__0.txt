You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **step back, take a breath, and look around**. The room feels suffocating—walls closing in, the air thick with unspoken words. Your friend’s eyes are blazing, their voice trembling with frustration. You both know this isn’t just about the issue at hand; it’s about the years of trust, the shared memories, the unspoken fears of drifting apart.  

As you stare at each other, the walls of the room begin to *shimmer*, like heat waves on a summer highway. Suddenly, the space *shifts*. The floor becomes a mirror, reflecting not your faces, but **a version of you and your friend from years ago**—laughing, carefree, arguing over something trivial, yet the laughter felt like a promise. The reflection *moves*, and you realize it’s not just a memory—it’s a *portal*.  

You glance back at your friend, who now has a tear in their eye. “We *used* to fight like this,” they say, their voice softer now. “But we’d always find our way back.” The mirror’s surface ripples, and a voice—not your friend’s, but *yours*—whispers, **“What’s the real fight here?”**  

The question lingers. You realize the argument isn’t about the surface issue—it’s about **fear**: fear of change, fear of being wrong, fear of losing the bond that made you who you are. The mirror cracks, revealing a starry sky. Your friend steps forward, their hand outstretched. “Let’s go back to the beginning,” they say. “No more fighting. Just… *us*.”  

You nod, and the room dissolves into light. When you open your eyes, you’re back in the real world, but the ache in your chest is different—*alive*, like a reminder that even the deepest wounds can be softened by the weight of truth and the courage to face it together.  

The dream ends, but the silence between you and your friend feels heavier, *meaningful*.
