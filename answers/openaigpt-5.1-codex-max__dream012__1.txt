…find yourself raising your voice over the roar of the wind, not just to be heard, but to steady your own heart. Spray lashes your face like a thousand cold fingers, and the wooden bones of the ship complain with every towering wave, yet there is a strange clarity in the chaos. Orders tumble from your mouth as if they’ve been waiting there: “Trim that sail! Lash down the barrel! Hold course!”

As you grip the wheel, you notice that the storm’s rhythm matches your breath. With each inhale the swells rise higher, with each exhale a path of calmer water appears in front of the bow. Lightning rips open the sky and, for a heartbeat, you see not clouds but a ceiling of swirling stars, the mast stretching up to touch them. Your crew, faces lit in ghostly blue light, trust you completely; their movements become one with your intentions, as if the entire ship is an extension of your will.

Then the sea changes. The waves soften, rolling not like water but like velvet dunes. You glance over the side and see reflections that do not belong: a vast forest, a childhood bedroom, a city street at night—all flickering in the surface. The storm’s roar becomes a distant murmur, and in its place you hear a low humming, a lullaby you haven’t heard in years. You know, somehow, that if you steer just a little to starboard you will find a harbor that has been waiting for you all your life.

You turn the wheel. The clouds part. A warm light spills across the deck and your crew cheers, their voices blending into the hum. As the keel kisses gentle waters and the anchor drops with a soft thud, the horizon tilts, the deck beneath you softens to sheets, and you blink awake, your hands still curled as if around a wheel, the echo of the dream’s sea singing quietly in the back of your mind.
