...feel a mix of panic and determination bubbling up inside you. The room seems to blur for a moment as your mind races, trying to figure out how on earth this is even possible. But then something strange happens—your surroundings shift slightly, almost imperceptibly.

Suddenly, you're not in the office anymore. You're standing in what looks like an enormous library filled with glowing books that float around you, each one radiating its own soft light. A calm voice echoes through the space: *"Knowledge is power, but focus determines reality."*

You instinctively reach out and grab one of the floating books. As soon as your fingers touch it, the book dissolves into a stream of golden particles that flow into your hands, filling your mind with clarity. Ideas flood in—strategies, tools, shortcuts, and solutions you never knew existed. It's as if the universe itself has conspired to download decades of expertise directly into your brain.

Back in the real world (or at least what feels like it), you blink and find yourself back at your desk. Your boss is still there, tapping their foot impatiently, but now you feel different. Calmer. Stronger. Like you've been preparing for this exact moment your entire life.

Without hesitation, you pull up your computer and begin typing faster than you ever have before. Lines of code, designs, plans—they all seem to materialize effortlessly under your fingertips. Time starts to warp; hours pass in what feels like minutes. Colleagues occasionally glance over, amazed by the flurry of productivity emanating from your corner of the office.

As the impossible deadline looms closer, you hit "submit" with seconds to spare. For a brief moment, everything goes silent. Then, your screen flashes green: **Project Complete. Success Assured.**

Your boss stares at the results, wide-eyed, before breaking into a slow clap. "I don’t know how you did it," they say, "but… good work."

But just as relief washes over you, the ground beneath your feet begins to tremble. The office fades away again, replaced by the same ethereal library—but this time, the glowing books are darker, pulsing with an ominous red hue. One of them flies toward you, opening mid-air to reveal a single sentence written in fiery letters:

**"Every gift comes with a price."**

Before you can react, the dream dissolves once more, leaving you suspended in darkness. Somewhere far off, you hear a clock ticking louder and louder, counting down to... something. And then—

*BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!*

Your alarm jolts you awake. You sit up in bed, heart pounding, unsure whether you just lived through a prophecy or simply had way too much coffee yesterday. Either way, you can't shake the feeling that today might be more eventful than usual.
