…freeze for a moment as the fluorescent lights above you begin to pulse. Your boss stands a few feet away, arms folded, expression half‑impatient, half‑expectant. You open your mouth to ask a question—no words come out—and when you look down, your hands have turned into hourglasses, each grain of sand slipping faster than the last.

Suddenly the conference‑room table stretches into a corridor lined with endless doors. Behind each door, you can hear distant ticking—one slower, one faster, one so erratic it sounds like a broken heartbeat. Your boss steps forward and hands you a single sheet of paper. The deadline is written in disappearing ink: “Due…NOW.”

Panicked, you sprint down the corridor. Every time you pass a door, the floor beneath you dissolves into rippling water, but you keep running, soaked and weightless. You burst through another door and find yourself in your own cubicle—but it’s smaller, stacked with piles of paper that float in mid‑air, forming a spiral staircase up to the ceiling.

You climb. At the top, you find a blank white wall and a glowing pen. Instinctively you take it and start sketching: flowing charts that bloom like flowers, paragraphs that curve into graphs, sentences that leap off the wall and reorganize themselves. As you draw, the impossible deadline papers train‑the wheels, stamps itself “APPROVED,” and dissolves into motes of light.

The corridor re‑forms around you, but this time the ticking is calm, measured. Your boss stands there again, smiling. In one hand, he offers you a steaming cup of coffee; in the other, your completed project, crisp and perfect. You take them both, and a warm relief spreads through your chest.

Just as you lift the coffee to your lips, you hear a distant alarm. The office fades, the glass walls melt into mist—and you jolt awake in your bed, the early morning light filtering through the curtains. The impossible deadline is gone, but your heart still races, and on your bedside table, the steaming mug you never reached in the dream sits warm to the touch.
