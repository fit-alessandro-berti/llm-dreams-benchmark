speak, feeling your voice become surprisingly calm and confident. At first, the words flow freely, your message resonating clearly in the attentive silence of the hall. Yet slowly, you notice the faces in the crowd shifting gently, becoming familiar—friends from childhood, family members, mentors, each smiling warmly and nodding softly as you speak.

You become aware you're not just speaking anymore, but floating gently upward, your feet rising comfortably off the stage, yet no one is alarmed. You notice you're effortlessly ascending toward an open night sky, where the stars and moon glow softly. Amazed, calm, and fully at peace, you continue sharing your thoughts, your voice expanding lovingly over the audience, who listens intently even as they fade away into light.

Now ascending entirely above the venue, you glide through cool, refreshing clouds, bathed in moonlight and surrounded by quiet, comforting whispers of encouragement. Everything becomes clear, meaningful, and luminous as you soar through the gentle night, joyful and free.
