You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and—

—each group is speaking in a language you almost understand, like a half-remembered childhood tune. One circle is debating the emotional weight of rain on different kinds of roofs — "A tin roof weeps with clarity," argues a woman in a dress made of looping silver wire, "but a thatched one sighs with secrets." You nod as if you’ve always known this, and they hand you a cup of tea that smells like图书馆 (library) and old socks.

Further on, a trio of people are juggling glowing marbles that contain miniature galaxies. One of them glances at you and says, “You’re here to find Leo, aren’t you?” You freeze. “How did you—?”  
“He’s the one who always forgets his own name at parties,” they laugh, tossing a marble that spirals upward to become a constellation shaped like a coffee mug. “He’s at the fountain. But be careful — it’s been raining inside tonight.”

You follow the sound of trickling water through a hall of mirrored doors, each reflecting not your face, but scenes from your life you forgot you lived: you as a child feeding a crystal bird on a windowsill; you as an old man planting trees underwater; you laughing alone in a elevator that rises into the clouds.

At the center of the room, a fountain spills not water, but shifting sentences — phrases from letters you never sent, poems you wrote and burned, apologies scribbled on napkins. And there, kneeling beside it, is Leo — but he’s made of book pages, rustling gently, his fingers typing invisible words into the air.

“You came,” he says without looking up. “I knew you would. I’ve been waiting for you to remember how to listen.”

You step forward, and as you do, the gathering dissolves — not into darkness, but into silence. The marbles drift upward like fireflies, the language of the roofs mellows into a hum, and the fountain’s words form one final sentence floating before you:

> “You were never lost. You were learning how to be found.”

You wake up, and for a moment — just a moment — you’re not sure whether you’re still dreaming… or whether the dream is dreaming you.
