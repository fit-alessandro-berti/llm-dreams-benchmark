**The Maze of Echoing Shadows**

As you solve the final mechanism of the last puzzle—a series of interlocking gears that hummed like a living thing—the wall before you groans open, revealing not another corridor, but a vast, circular chamber. The air is thick with the scent of old parchment and something metallic, like blood left too long in the sun.

At the center of the room stands a **pedestal**, its surface carved with the same symbols you’ve seen repeated throughout the maze: spirals, eyes, and a serpent devouring its own tail. Resting atop it is a **mirror**, but not one of glass. Its surface ripples like liquid mercury, reflecting not your face, but *fragments*—glimpses of other versions of you, each trapped in their own maze, their expressions a mix of terror, determination, and resignation.

A voice, neither male nor female, whispers from the shadows:
*"You have walked the path of the seeker. But the maze is not a test. It is a* **prison**."

The walls around you begin to **breathe**. The symbols pulse with a faint, sickly light, and the floor trembles as if something vast is stirring beneath it. The mirror’s reflection shifts—now it shows not other *yous*, but **the maze itself**, stretching endlessly in all directions, a labyrinth of black stone and flickering torches, with no exit in sight.

Then, from the darkness behind the pedestal, a **figure** steps forward.

It wears your face.

Not a twin, not a doppelgänger—*you*, but older, hollow-eyed, its skin stretched too tight over its bones. Its lips curl into a smile that doesn’t reach its eyes.

*"You think you’re the first to solve the puzzles?"* it rasps. *"I was you. And you will be me. The maze doesn’t let go. It* **feeds**."

The figure extends a hand, palm up. In its grip is a **key**—rusted, jagged, the same metal as the mirror. *"Take it,"* it urges. *"Unlock the door. Or stay. It doesn’t matter. The maze always wins."*

Behind you, the corridor you came from **seals shut** with a sound like a dying breath. The torches gutter. The only light now comes from the mirror, which begins to **crack**, thin fractures spiderwebbing across its surface.

And then—

A **choice**.

Do you:
1. **Take the key** and turn toward the pedestal, even as the figure’s smile widens into something inhuman?
2. **Smash the mirror** with your bare hands, consequences be damned?
3. **Run**—but the maze has no exits, and the walls are already shifting, corridors rearranging like a living thing?
4. **Ask the figure a question**—*"What happens if I refuse?"*—and brace for the answer?

The air grows heavier. The whispers rise into a chorus. The maze is waiting.

What do you do?
