Of course! Here’s a continuation of your dream:

---

You weave through the crowded room, scanning faces for the familiar one—your only acquaintance in this sea of strangers. The air hums with laughter and clinking glasses, but their voice isn’t among them.

Then, you notice a group gathered by the window, their silence stark against the noise. A woman with sharp eyes meets your gaze. "You’re looking for someone," she says, not a question. The others turn, curious.

Before you can answer, the group shifts, and there—across the room—you spot them. But as you start forward, the woman’s hand brushes your wrist. "Wait," she murmurs. "They’re not who you think."

A collective gasp. The room tilts. The walls stretch, and the faces around you dissolve into shifting patterns, the gathering morphing into something unseen. Your friend’s voice calls from far away—or is it?—and you realize you’ve been sleepwalking into a dream within a dream.

Would you like to deepen the surrealism, or steer it toward a resolution?
