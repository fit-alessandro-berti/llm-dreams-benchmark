accept their offer with hesitation, your voice barely audible over the roar of passing traffic. One of them—a woman with bright eyes and an accent you can’t quite place—smiles and says, “You’re not lost. You’re just on the edge of a new story.”

They lead you through narrow alleyways painted with murals that seem to shift with the light, past cafes overflowing with laughter and alley cats that stare like they’ve known you forever. The city no longer feels cold and indifferent. It hums with secrets waiting to be shared.

The group doesn’t ask where you’re going. They seem to know that the destination isn’t really the point. You walk together beneath a sky turned deep violet, the city growing softer around the edges. You begin to laugh too—softly at first, then more bravely, as though the laughter has always lived inside you but had been buried under fear.

At a quiet plaza filled with glowing lanterns, one of the strangers—a child with a paper crown and paint on her fingertips—says, “We found you because you called us.”

And in that moment, it makes sense. You weren’t lost. You were waiting for a sign that you weren’t alone.

The dream begins to dissolve like fog in morning sunlight, but before it fades entirely, you hear someone whisper, “The way forward is not forgotten; it’s just hidden in your heart.”

You wake up with a strange peace… and a map drawn in crayon still crumpled in your hand.
