…you feel a storm approaching and the air itself seems to tear like wet paper. The wind in the pines turns metallic, clanging like iron chimes. A tongue-thick pressure pushes against your ears; then the sky tilts and pours—only it isn’t rain but liquid light, silver as melted coins, dropping straight down in weighted sheets. Each droplet spits stars when it strikes the mossy ground.

Your heartbeat syncs to a rumble that’s half-thunder, half-drummer. Between flashes you see roots flaring bright orange, as if the earth were a kiln and each root a filament. The path pools into mirror-ponds that show reflections upside-down: you standing still, the forest inverted, a second self suspended under glass who looks up and mouths, “Come home.”

You step forward; your shoes melt off like wax and the ground cools them into two small ammonites. Lightning vines race the tree trunks, pulsing in arboreal Morse. They spell the words keep walking backward in winks of eel-blue fire.

A silence rings so loudly that it deafens the lightning. The rain freezes mid-descent—every droplet a bead of ice-glass glittering in the split-second hush. You lift one between your palms; inside it burns an actual flame, turning the droplet into a round lantern. When you throw it ahead, it smashes against the path and blooms into a doorway of amber fire. Through the doorway you glimpse the same forest, but undressed of storm: green dusk, a single heron asleep on its own reflection.

A choice latches to your ribs like wet wings: step through and wake in gentle woods, or stay and let the storm finish writing itself across the dark parchment of this dream.
