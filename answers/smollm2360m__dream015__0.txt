I'll do my best, like this: (claps hands together) Ah, where do I even begin?! The post-apocalyptic world, dark and foreboding, yet full of life. You see, every resource is precious, as everything else is – water, food, medicine. But the dangers are endless, too. Lightning strikes at any moment, a wildfire could burn down your homestead in just seconds, you can't even breathe if the air's contaminated. I find myself standing at the edge of this vast expanse, surrounded by all these risks and possibilities. And yet...I keep on going. Because one day, when some sort of miracle happens, I hope you'll be able to look back down from wherever you are on earth and say 'Oh yes, it was a dream too.'
