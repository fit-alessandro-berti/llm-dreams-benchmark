…step up to the wheel, feeling the deck tilt beneath your boots like the breath of some enormous sleeping animal. Lightning stitches the sky into brief, white bones. Your crew’s eyes gleam in the flashes—salt-slick, terrified, hopeful. You plant your feet, let the wind pour its weight against your shoulders, and you lift your voice until it cuts clean through the thunder.

“All hands—listen!”

The words ring like a bell through rain. The ship answers with a groan, a living thing, ribs straining, canvas snapping like wings trying to remember how to fly. You point to the east where the clouds are a bruise, darker than the rest. “Bring her around to starboard. Heave to on the foreline. We ride the wave, not fight it.”

They move. The deck becomes a choreography of slick ropes and sure hands. You take the wheel, palms burning, and feel it hum with a heartbeat that matches your own. Another wave climbs the world’s edge and falls toward you, a mountain of water wearing the sky as a crown. For a breath, the crew’s faces rise with it—your carpenter’s scar, your cook’s prayer, the deckhand’s mouth forming your name.

“Steady,” you say, and the word becomes an anchor.

The prow lifts. The ship climbs, shuddering, and in the eye of a lightning flash you see shapes in the water—windows, staircases, a city submerged and luminous, bending like kelp. Voices rise with the spray, not quite human. They sound like lullabies you forgot and maps you never learned to read. Your heart kicks. You know this: the storm has teeth, but the sea is a library that doesn’t mind if you whisper.

“On my count,” you call. “Three… two… now!”

The sails take a deep breath like lungs. The crew pulls in unison. The ship crests the wave, pauses at the summit where the world goes quiet, and for an instant the sky is a dome of black glass and the stars are nails hammered into it. You can see all the way to the far edge of the ocean, where dawn is practicing its first, faint chord. The ship slides down the wave’s far face—not falling, not failing, but surfing a line so delicate it could be a violin string.

When you reach the trough, the wind shifts. It comes warm from nowhere. The rain softens into scattered pearls. You release the wheel and it keeps turning under your fingers as if guided by the hands of someone older than you, someone you’ve only met in stories told by candlelight. The crew takes up a chant, low and steady, and you whisper it with them. The storm rearranges itself into a cathedral of cloud—arches and aisles and a window of pale gold directly ahead.

“Hold course,” you tell them, and your voice is calm now, quiet and certain, like a harbor you carry inside your chest. “We sail through the door.”

You pass under the cloud’s archway. The rain becomes confetti of moonlight, catching in hair and rigging. The salt on your lips tastes like the first day you ever saw the ocean. The deck steadies, the ropes sigh, and your compass—unreliable all night—swings one last time and stops, its needle pointing not north but toward something you have no name for and recognize completely.

A gull cries once, like a key turning.

Someone laughs—a young, surprised sound—and you realize it’s you.

Then the sea smooths itself like a sheet. The ship coasts into water the color of old glass. The crew looks to you again, but now it’s different: not for rescue, but for the story that will make sense of what just happened. You step away from the wheel and lean on the rail. The sky above is slowly unbuttoning at the horizon, showing the tender seam of dawn.

“Log it,” you say, and your quartermaster nods, pen scratching, ink refusing to blur despite the damp. You dictate—coordinates that don’t exist, winds that sang in a language you can almost remember, a doorway made of weather, a promise shaped like a needle. You speak it into the book, and you feel the ship listening, the ocean listening, the dream itself tilting its head to hear.

“Captain?” your first mate asks softly, as if not to wake something. “What now?”

You look ahead where the light lays a path across the water and breaks into a thousand small mirrors. Each one holds a different version of the ship, of you: the captain who turned back, the captain who pressed on, the captain who learned the names of every current and the one who learned to let them carry him.

You choose. “We keep going,” you say. “We always keep going.”

You lift your hand, and the wind, obedient as a freshly taught dog, rises to meet your palm. The sails billow. The ship leans forward like a runner in the instant before the gun.

And as the first gold thread of morning pulls through the cloth of the sky, the storm behind you folds itself into a map you can tuck in your pocket, the crew’s breathing settles into the rhythm of the hull, and somewhere, far inland, a sleeper turns on their pillow, smiling at something they won’t remember but will trust all day.

You are the captain. The sea is listening. The horizon opens its mouth to sing.
