You start to wander down a bustling avenue, the towering glass buildings reflecting the shifting colors of the morning sky. People rush past in every direction, each absorbed in their own unseen worlds. A sense of urgency tugs at you, but the streets twist and turn in ways that seem almost impossible, like a maze designed by a mischievous mind. 

You ask a stranger for directions, but their words come out as a jumble of nonsense, slipping through your fingers like sand. Maps on your phone lead you in circles, and every time you check the time, it seems to reset itself. The city feels both ancient and futuristic, with neon signs flickering in languages you don't recognize and alleyways that open into unexpected gardens.

Eventually, you spot a clocktower in the distance, its face glowing with a soft, inviting light. As you approach, you realize the meeting isn't a place—it's a person. Someone you've been searching for, standing under the clocktower, waving you over. You hurry toward them, and as you get closer, the city fades into a gentle mist, leaving just the two of you under the glowing clock, ready to begin.
