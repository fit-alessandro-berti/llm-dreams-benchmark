panic, clutching the ridiculously vague email confirmation in my sweaty hand. An hour... how could I be so late? My heart pounded against my ribs like a trapped bird. The city, even in the fuzzy haze of my dream, felt oppressive. Buildings, taller than anything I'd ever seen, loomed over me like stalactites, and the air hummed with an anxious energy, a low thrum of frantic movement that mirrored the frantic buzzing in my head.

...start to retrace the labyrinthine streets, my footsteps echoing on the cobblestones like gunfire in the otherwise bustling city. My limited time fueled a frantic energy, the opposite of the peaceful serenity I was supposed to be cultivating while on "vacation".  The air itself crackled with a nervous tension. I backed away from the news of the city,  the gravity of the approaching deadline, and the ominous-looking sky seemed to whisper "running late" as the scene twisted and the buildings became a blur of metallic gleam and shadowed glass. I had no clue who the meeting was with, where it was taking place or the importance of it. A persistent feeling of being trapped in a confusing maze of  expectations and deadlines, brewed in my gut.

I clutched the flimsy paper in my hand, the ink running slightly as if my anxieties were attempting to erase the meeting's location, the words swirling before me: "Thursday, 1 pm. Access details inside". 

...start to panic, I realize I'm still wearing my work clothes: the rumpled blazer, the stuffy button-down. Against the incessant hum of the city, a growing dissonance starts to sound

from my alarm clock, a rumble besides the city's sky-high pulse. The email was the only thing I had to go by - the advertisement for a local coffee shop was buzzing past me. I had promised the handsome barista with the twinkling eyes a presentation about coffee consumption patterns in the city, but how could I possibly prepare a

proper presentation with this sudden paradox of buildings reaching for the clouds as a low temor baste must be accompanied joy

and unspoken phone numbers, I thought wryly. I always hated cityscapes, they choked me. This, I have to admit, was the main reason the

sender had slipped up. Leaving a marketing campaign for a coffee shop residing in a nondescript building felt harmless

enough... a ... My eye snagged on the webcam-enabled espresso machine

as it blinked and whirred, momentarily distracting me from my predicament. I clutched the paper tighter.

The meeting was with the owner of the coffee shop, Mr. Petrov, about regional coffee blends for the "new range" promotion, in quotes in the email because I was

a struggling writer, not a barista. This **"regional" theme** for the email felt passionate... a

tribute to what he believed would be my last bastion of relaxation.

The "[coffee shop, which was probably buzzing slightly]". 

There's the other there! I look for any landmark, any clue

This buzzing turned into a deafening roar as the anxieties closed in and I remember seeing a coffee shop with

surprisingly,

the **"Morning Glory" cafe**. I looked at

You can't be serious, an email for a coffee shop, how unhelpful. The image of a single "1 p.m." written on a piece of

was just so ridiculously clumsy and overly-brightly colored. It truly was like a scene from
