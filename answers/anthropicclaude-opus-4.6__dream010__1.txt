# The Dream

You are participating in a competition where the grand prize is your dream job. As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and...

...the first one seems simple enough. You're standing in a vast white room with twelve other contestants. A woman in a sharp silver suit — the kind that seems to shift color when she moves — announces:

*"Build something that matters. You have one hour. Your materials are behind you."*

I turn around. There's nothing there but a single wooden chair.

Some contestants panic. Others start dismantling the chair immediately, fashioning crude tools, tiny sculptures. One person just sits in it, arms crossed, claiming it's performance art.

I pick up the chair, carry it across the room, and set it down in front of a contestant who's been standing on a injured leg, trying not to show it. She looks at me, surprised, and sits.

The silver-suited woman smiles. I advance.

**The second challenge** takes place in a library that stretches infinitely upward. The books have no titles on their spines. I'm told to find the one that contains *my* story — but when I open it, the pages are blank. I realize I'm supposed to *write* it, not find it. My hand trembles as words appear beneath my fingers in handwriting I almost recognize.

**The third challenge** is the one that breaks me.

I'm placed in a room with a perfect mirror. But the reflection doesn't copy me — it *interrogates* me. It asks every question I've been avoiding:

*"Why do you think you deserve this?"*
*"What if you get everything you want and it isn't enough?"*
*"Who are you when no one is watching?"*

I answer honestly. Each truth physically hurts, a bright ache behind my sternum. Contestants around me are lying to their reflections, and the mirrors shatter one by one, eliminating them.

Mine cracks — but holds.

**The final round.** Only two of us remain. The silver-suited woman reveals the dream job at last, but it's different for each of us — she whispers it so only I can hear, and what she describes is so precisely, achingly *right* that tears sting my eyes.

The last challenge: *"Convince me you'll still be kind when you have power."*

I open my mouth—

And I wake up.

My heart is pounding. The room is dark. And I can't remember what the job was — only the feeling of being *so close* to something I was made for.

The chair. The blank book. The cracked mirror.

I lie there, staring at the ceiling, wondering if the answer I was about to give would have been enough.

Wondering if I'll dream my way back tonight.
