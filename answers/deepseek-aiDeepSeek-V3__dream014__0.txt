...begin walking with them through the winding streets of the city. The tall buildings seem to blur as the strangers guide you with warm smiles and reassuring words. They share stories about their own experiences of feeling lost, and their tales make you feel less alone. As you walk, the city’s noise fades into the background, replaced by the sound of laughter and the gentle hum of conversation.

Eventually, you arrive at a small, cozy café tucked away in a quiet corner of the city. The group invites you inside, and the scent of freshly brewed coffee and pastries fills the air. As you sit down, one of the strangers hands you a map and says, "This city can be overwhelming, but it’s also full of hidden paths and kind hearts. You’ll find your way."

Suddenly, you feel a sense of calm and clarity. The strangers begin to fade, as if their purpose has been fulfilled. You’re left at the café, holding the map, and the dream shifts. The bustling city transforms into a serene landscape, and you realize that you’re no longer lost. You’re exactly where you need to be. The dream ends with a soft whisper, "You’ll always find your way."
