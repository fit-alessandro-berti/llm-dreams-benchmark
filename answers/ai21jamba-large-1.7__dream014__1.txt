follow them, unsure but hopeful. They lead you down winding streets you’ve never noticed before, passing by colorful murals and hidden cafes. The strangers chatter warmly, their kindness helping ease your worry. Eventually, they bring you to a small park surrounded by tall buildings.

You look down at the pond—and see your own reflection smiling back.
