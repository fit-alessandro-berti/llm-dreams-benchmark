…follow them through the crowd, half-expecting them to vanish the moment you blink.

They don’t.

They move like they’ve been waiting for you—unhurried, gentle, making space in the tide of commuters so you don’t get swept away. One of them walks just close enough that you can hear them over the city’s roar, and their voice sounds oddly familiar, like a song you knew before you knew words.

“Where are you trying to go?” they ask.

You open your mouth, and nothing comes out at first. Your destination feels like a thought you dropped somewhere and can’t find again. The strangers don’t seem bothered. They nod as if silence is an address.

“Then we’ll start with what you can remember,” another says, pressing something small into your palm.

It’s a paper map, warm from their hands—but the lines don’t hold still. Streets rearrange themselves in ink like living veins. A little dot pulses faintly where you stand, as if the map has a heartbeat. When you tilt it, the dot slides, not because you moved, but because the city did.

The group guides you beneath an awning where rain is falling in slow motion, each drop hanging like a glass bead. The noise of the city dulls, as though someone turned the world down. Beyond the curtain of suspended rain, storefront signs flicker between languages you almost recognize, and people’s faces blur into soft brushstrokes.

“You’ve been walking in circles,” one stranger says, pointing to the map. “See?”

A thin trail behind the dot loops again and again, tighter each time, like a spiral into the center of a shell.

“How do I stop?” you whisper, surprised you can speak now.

They exchange looks—tender, practical, not pitying.

“You don’t stop by trying harder,” the tallest one says. “You stop by choosing one thing that’s yours.”

They lead you to a subway entrance that wasn’t there a moment ago. The stairwell descends into light instead of darkness. The air smells like lemons and old books. Above the steps, a sign reads:

LAST TRAIN TO SOMEWHERE YOU REMEMBER

You hesitate. The city behind you surges and reshapes. The strangers wait without urging. The map in your hand grows heavier, as if it’s filling with all the paths you didn’t take.

“What if I get on and it’s wrong?” you ask.

The one beside you smiles, and for a second you swear you’ve seen them in your own mirror, late at night, when you’re too tired to keep pretending you’re fine.

“Wrong is still movement,” they say. “Circles aren’t.”

You step down.

The station is impossibly quiet. A train is already there with doors open, gleaming as if freshly dreamed. Inside, the seats are upholstered in patterns of clouds. There are no advertisements—only framed photos of ordinary things: a kitchen table with sunlight on it, a hand holding another hand, a front door with chipped paint, a pair of shoes by a bed.

The strangers file in with you, then stop at the threshold as if they can’t go farther.

“This is where we leave you,” one says.

You grip the map. “Who are you?”

They glance at one another, and when they look back, their eyes are bright with the same emotion you feel when you find something you thought you’d lost forever.

“We’re the part of you that still asks,” the tallest one answers. “The part that still believes someone will help.”

The doors begin to chime.

Panic rises—sharp, sudden. “Wait. I don’t want to be alone again.”

“You won’t be,” they say, and each of them taps the map lightly, like sealing an envelope. “But you have to ride it yourself.”

The doors slide shut. The train starts with a soft, comforting lurch. Through the window, the strangers stand on the platform, growing smaller, not as the train pulls away, but as if they’re folding back into the background of the world.

You look down at the map.

It’s blank now—except for a single word written in the center in your own handwriting:

HOME

The train enters a tunnel, but instead of darkness, the walls glow with moving scenes: moments you’d forgotten you kept—laughter that startled you back into yourself, the smell of rain through an open window, the exact weight of quiet on a safe night. The farther you go, the more the city noise fades until it becomes something like ocean surf.

Your chest loosens. The loneliness doesn’t vanish, but it stops being a locked room and becomes a door you can open.

The train slows.

A familiar station appears, though you’re sure you’ve never been here. The name on the platform sign flickers between places: YOUR STREET, YOUR NAME, RIGHT NOW.

The doors open. Warm air touches your face. You step out, and the ground feels steady in a way the city never did. Ahead is a simple doorway, lit from within. You can hear faint music, the clink of dishes, a voice calling—not demanding, not urgent—just glad you’re arriving.

You reach for the handle.

And just before you turn it, you wake up with the feeling of that map still pressed into your palm, as if the dream left you directions you can’t quite read—but somehow understand.
