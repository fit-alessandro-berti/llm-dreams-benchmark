...symbols etched into the wood. They weren't locks I recognized, no simple keyholes or tumblers, but a web of strange, glowing lines that seemed to pulse with an inner light. The intricate engravings, swirling and entwining like vines around the  box, hummed faintly to the touch, each line tingling with a warmth that made my fingers twitch. It felt wrong, somehow, a false lock, as if it were meant to be admired, not opened.

As I ran my fingers over the etched patterns, I realized they weren't just decorative. Each swirling line, every oddly-shaped symbol seemed to resonate with a powerful energy. Behind me, the forest floor pulsed like the box, the air thickening with an tangible, buzzing anticipation. The patterns continued past the lid, swirling and catching the moonlight to form shimmering, ghostly images all over the box.

I felt a strange pull towards the shapes, like I should be able to feel them humming, to sense their hidden meaning. Turning the box over in my hands, I found myself captivated by its alien beauty. My dream fingers, clumsy and ethereal as they were, seemed to dance over the embossed silver dolphin leaping from a crashing wave, a symbol I couldn't quite decipher.  

Suddenly, the tree before me pulsed with even brighter light, the moonlight intensifying the strange dances and whirls etched upon the box. As I looked closer, I saw the buzzing images on the tree begin to focus and take shape. Was my imagination playing tricks on me through the hazy veil of sleep? The box glowed with a pulsating, bluish light, and the carved dolphin seemed to emerge from the tree, shimmering and ethereal as it swam towards me, leaving the intricate patterns behind...until the moment I looked closer, its form solidified into something more tangible, more real.  

The glowing dolphin jumped from the glowing, almost translucent, body hitting the warm patch of moonlight directly beneath it, a silver figure leaped from the moonlit amulets on my Dream Guide's necklace.  Maybe it was the lack of gravity, maybe it was the magic of the forest itself, but the dolphin seemed to have ripped a hole in the fabric of my dream, allowing a bright, almost jarringly clear image to emerge. The ocean finally gave way to something new... a vast starry sky. But instead of stars, the image was replaced by a group of people staring at the box, their faces illuminated by the rising moon, their eyes filled with curiosity and dread.  They had gathered in secrecy, drawn by the whispering secrets of the moonlit etchings. A circle of ancient symbols appeared around the base of the tree, forging the most intricate patterns out of the slats I hadn't noticed before. The box, now keyless, glowed brighter, pinning the group under its mesmerizing light. 


I realized this was no ordinary box in the hands of justice.
