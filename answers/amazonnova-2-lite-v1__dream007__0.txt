### **You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to…**

…**step back for a moment, taking a deep breath, and say, “Let’s pause for a second. I care about this — and I care about *us*. Can we talk this through without tearing each other apart?”**

The tension in the air doesn’t vanish instantly, but your words act like a spell, softening the edges of the conflict. Your friend hesitates, their fists unclenching slightly, eyebrows furrowed not with anger now, but with confusion. You can see the storm in their eyes — the same storm that lives inside you.

You both move to sit beneath the old oak tree at the edge of the garden — the one that’s seen a hundred whispered secrets and childhood vows. The wind rustles the leaves like an audience holding its breath.

“Okay,” they say, voice quieter now. “Explain it to me like I’m five. Because right now, it feels like we’re speaking different languages.”

You nod, choosing your words carefully. “It’s not that I don’t understand where you’re coming from. I do. But what I’m really trying to protect — what we *both* need — is…”

You pause, searching for the right phrase, and suddenly a memory surfaces — the time you and your friend built a fort out of snow during a rare winter storm. You’d laughed until your cheeks hurt, sharing hot cocoa and dreams of traveling the world.

“That fort,” you continue, “it didn’t survive the sun. But the *idea* of it — the fun, the trust, the belief in something bigger than just the cold — that stayed with us. This feels like that. Like we’re building something new together, but we’ve hit a patch of ice we didn’t see coming.”

Your friend listens, really listens. The anger in their face starts to melt, replaced by something else — understanding, maybe even relief.

“And maybe,” you add, leaning forward, “we don’t have all the answers yet. But if we keep talking, if we promise not to walk away until we’ve heard each other fully… we can find a way forward. Together.”

The silence that follows isn’t heavy anymore. It’s a breath. Then, slowly, your friend nods. “Okay,” they whisper again, but this time it’s not hesitation — it’s a promise.

And as the two of you begin to speak again, this time not as opponents, but as partners in a shared dream, the oak tree above you seems to sigh, its branches shifting gently — as if it too has been waiting for this moment.

Would you like the dream to continue in a particular direction — perhaps a revelation, a symbolic encounter, or a shift into another scene?
