...take a step back to cool down. You realize that the argument is escalating and that neither of you is really listening to the other. You take a deep breath and say, "You know what? I think we need to take a break from this conversation. We're both too heated right now, and I don't want to say something I'll regret."

Your friend looks at you, surprised but also a bit relieved. They nod and say, "Yeah, you're right. Let's talk about this later when we've both had some time to think."

You both agree to meet up the next day at a quiet café to continue the discussion. As you walk away, you feel a sense of calm wash over you. The dream shifts, and you find yourself in a serene park. The sun is setting, casting a warm glow over everything. You sit down on a bench and watch as children play, their laughter filling the air.

Suddenly, you notice a small, glowing orb floating towards you. It hovers in front of your face, and you reach out to touch it. As your fingers make contact, the orb pulses with light, and you feel a surge of warmth and understanding. The orb speaks to you in a soft, ethereal voice, "You have made the right choice. Sometimes, the best way to resolve a conflict is to step back and gain perspective."

You smile, feeling a sense of peace and clarity. The orb floats away, and you stand up, ready to face whatever comes next with a newfound sense of calm and wisdom. The dream fades, and you wake up feeling refreshed and ready to tackle the day ahead.
