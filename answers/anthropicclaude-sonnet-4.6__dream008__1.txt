You are at your workplace, and suddenly, you are given a project with an impossible deadline. Your boss is waiting for you to start, and you...

...look down at your hands and notice your fingers have become translucent, like frosted glass. You can see the bones inside, glowing faintly blue. Strange, you think, but there's no time for that now.

You open your laptop and the screen displays not a document, but a vast ocean. Waves roll across the monitor in real time. Your boss leans over your shoulder and says, *"Perfect. That's exactly what I needed."* This makes no sense, but somehow you understand completely.

You begin typing, except the keys produce sounds instead of letters — a piano note for each keystroke, building into something that sounds almost like a song. The deadline clock on the wall is running backwards. Each minute you gain feels like breathing room, like relief blooming in your chest.

Your coworkers are working too, but they're sitting in rowboats scattered around the office floor, which has become shallow water, ankle-deep and warm. Nobody finds this remarkable.

Then your boss hands you a folder. Inside is a single sheet of paper that reads:

*"The project was never the point."*

You look up to ask what it means, but your boss has become a tall window, and through it you can see a city made entirely of *yesterday* — familiar streets from years ago, lit in that particular golden light of late afternoon memories.

The deadline passes.

Nothing collapses.

You exhale for what feels like the first time all day, and the ocean on your screen gently applauds.
