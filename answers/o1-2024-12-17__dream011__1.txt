…not what you expected at all. Instead of neat rows of multiple-choice or essay questions printed in clear black ink, the pages are filled with swirling, shifting patterns of color and text that refuse to settle into a recognizable language. It’s as if the paper itself is breathing softly, each inhalation turning the words into shapes, and each exhalation returning them to letters that mean nothing to you. Nervousness climbs your spine, and you glance around the room to see if anyone else is struggling. But the other students don’t seem to notice the strangeness. They are hunched over their exams, scribbling away, their pencils gliding confidently across the pages.

You look back at your own test and try to focus. Now, instead of letters, the page is covered in small, intricate ink drawings of scenes you somehow know are important: a young child dropping a porcelain teacup on a marble floor; a grey wolf howling beneath a starlit sky; a staircase that spirals upward into blank white space. These images shift like reflections on water, and as you stare, you realize the question might not be to answer something traditionally. Instead, you might need to interpret these scenes—to find some hidden meaning that unlocks the rest of the exam.

Your heart pounds. Time is passing, and yet you can’t even decipher a single prompt. You run a finger along the margin of the paper and feel a subtle warmth, as though it’s alive. Then you feel a gentle tug. It’s faint, but insistent, guiding your gaze to the bottom right corner where the ink has pooled into thick, black curls. You blink, and now you see it clearly: the instructions have woven themselves into the lines between the images. They read, in whisper-thin script: “To progress, rewrite what you see into what you know. Compare the hush of the wolf’s cry to the brilliance of the distant stars. Tell us how a falling teacup tastes when it shatters. Lead the staircase somewhere you can belong.” 

Your pencil hovers uncertainly above the page. The room seems quieter now; your classmates’ frantic scribbling fades into the background. You take a breath and follow the strange directive. As soon as you begin, the lines you write bloom into meaning on the page. Now the exam is guiding you through a series of transformations: each symbolic vision becomes a riddle that you resolve through your own memories, your own dreams. You find yourself writing poetry you didn’t know you could create. You find yourself penning answers that feel like revelations rather than mere responses.

Time warps. The bell for the end of the exam looms, and yet somehow each new question leads seamlessly into the next. You feel both hurried and strangely calm, compelled to lay yourself bare on the page. The more honest you are—about your fears, your passions, the fragments of your identity you try to keep hidden—the more the test seems to reward you. The shifting images settle into steady lines of text. Your pencil glides more easily, your thoughts flowing as ink, and when you finally reach the last page, you find just one final request:

“Describe yourself after you have left this classroom, after you have chosen what to do with your life. Let your answer become your truth.”

You raise your eyes. The other students are gone. The classroom’s windows open onto a gentle landscape, not the city streets you know. A breeze stirs the hair at the back of your neck, and sunlight washes the walls in warm, golden hues. It’s quiet and peaceful now, as if the world is waiting for your reply. With a steady hand, you write about who you will become—your dreams, your strengths, your hopes—and as your pencil forms the last sentence, the page itself seems to smile, as though it understands you better than anyone ever has.

Then, softly and without warning, you wake up.
