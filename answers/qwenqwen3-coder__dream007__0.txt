*take a deep breath and step back from the intensity of the moment*

You know what? I think we're both getting too worked up about this. Can we pause for a minute? 

*I sit down on a nearby bench, gesturing for my friend to do the same*

Look, whatever this is about - whether it's the project we're working on, or where we're going with our friendship, or whatever else is bothering us - it's clear this matters to both of us. That means it's worth working through carefully, not shouting through.

*I look directly at my friend*

What if we tried to really listen to each other for a few minutes? No interrupting, no getting defensive. Just... really hear what the other person is trying to say. Because I know you, and I know that underneath all this frustration, you're coming from a place of caring. And so am I.

*pause*

Want to try that? Start over, but slower this time?

*In dreams, these moments of clarity often emerge - when we find ourselves able to cut through the noise and reach for understanding, even in the midst of conflict.*
