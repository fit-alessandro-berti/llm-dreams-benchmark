...you realize the sound of the wind isn't wind at all. It's a chorus of forgotten lullabies, faint and haunting.

The sky, once a peaceful blue, is now a swirling canvas of deep indigo and violet, shot through with veins of silent, pulsing lightning. The leaves on the trees are no longer green; they have turned to thin, crinkled sheet music, rustling with melodies that harmonize with the approaching storm.

You feel an urgent need to find shelter, but your feet won't obey. Instead, they carry you deeper into the woods, following the source of the music. The path beneath you is no longer soil and roots, but smooth, polished obsidian that reflects the strange, beautiful chaos of the sky above.

The first drops of rain begin to fall. They aren’t wet. They are warm and heavy, like liquid amber, and they don't splash when they hit the ground. They hum, adding a low, resonant bass note to the chorus of the wind.

You arrive at a clearing. In the center sits an ancient, gnarled rocking chair, creaking back and forth in perfect time with the lullabies. It is empty. Yet, you feel a distinct presence, a sense of being watched with an old and gentle sadness.

As you take a step closer, a single, perfect glass bird with feathers made of captured starlight lands on the back of the chair. It opens its tiny beak, and the single, pure note it sings silences the storm completely.

The wind stops. The lullabies fade into an echo. The amber rain evaporates before it touches the ground. The sky stills, a peaceful, star-dusted twilight.

The note from the bird resonates in your chest, a feeling of profound peace and a longing for something you can't quite name. You know, with the certainty only a dream can provide, that you were the one rocking in that chair, singing those lullabies to someone you are trying desperately to remember.

You reach out to touch the glass bird, and as your fingers make contact, it dissolves into a cloud of soft, warm light that flows into you. The clearing begins to fade, the obsidian path melting into the soft light of dawn filtering through your eyelids.

You are waking up. The only thing that remains is the echo of a single, perfect note, and the faint, sweet smell of rain on dry earth.
