stumble over my words at first, my mind racing as I try to remember where I left off in my notes. The hum of the crowd grows louder, and I feel the weight of their anticipation pressing down on me. My palms grow sweaty, and my heart starts to pound in my chest. 

But then, something shifts. The faces in the audience start to blur, and I realize that instead of strangers, they're all people I know—family, friends, colleagues, even random acquaintances from my past. They're not there to judge me; they're there to support me. 

I take a deep breath, and the words begin to flow more easily. I start speaking not just to them, but for them. I share stories, laugh, and connect with them on a deeper level. The tension melts away, and I feel a sense of peace wash over me. 

As I finish, there's an unexpected round of applause, and the audience stands to give me a standing ovation. I look out at them, smiling, and for the first time, I truly feel like I've connected with everyone. The dream fades as I stand there, feeling lighter and more confident than ever before.
