The familiar pattern begins, and my legs feel heavy as I struggle to get through the section on technology. With pencil in hand, I carefully begin to address each question. The first one comes up: "What type of data is a lot-of used to be." After some analysis, I reply confidently with that phrase, "A lot-of use." I continue writing it down without spelling out the full sentence after about 25 attempts (but by then I must have gone through more than five), finally getting through two words. As my eyes scan the board, a big screen lights up and shows me the answer - "The digital landscape is vast and constantly evolving in an ever-changing environment." I glance at the teacher for confirmation, my heart racing as I look around, unsure of what else to present or how much data I will need to show for every question.
