walk away, not out of anger, but to give both of you space to cool down and reflect. As you step outside, you notice the air is unnaturally still, and the sky has taken on a strange, metallic sheen. The trees around you begin to sway, though there’s no wind. Then, without warning, the ground beneath your feet starts to ripple like water. You look down in shock as your shadow stretches impossibly long—then detaches from your feet.

It slithers away from you, forming into a dark, humanoid shape with glowing eyes. Before you can react, it speaks in your voice, repeating the last words you said to your friend in the argument. But this time, the tone is mocking. The shadow-creature grins and starts to recite other things you’ve said—hurtful words from past fights, secrets you’ve kept, even things you’ve only *thought* but never spoken aloud.

Panicked, you turn to run, but your legs won’t move. The shadow steps closer, whispering, *"You always run instead of listening. Even now."*

And then—

A hand clamps onto your shoulder. You spin around to see your friend standing there, looking just as confused as you are. They don’t see the shadow. Instead, they say, *"Hey… I think we both need to talk. For real, this time."*

The shadow flickers, as if caught between two worlds.

What happens next? Do you face the shadow together? Does it dissolve into the ground, leaving you both shaken but more willing to listen? Or does something even stranger unfold—perhaps the shadow was never the enemy, but a reflection of the fear you both share?

(Let me know if you'd like to steer the dream in a particular direction!)
