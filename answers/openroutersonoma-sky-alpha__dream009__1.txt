You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to blend in quickly to avoid drawing suspicion from the locals—your modern clothes and bewildered expression are already turning heads in this bustling medieval marketplace, where horse-drawn carts rumble over cobblestone streets and merchants hawk spices and silks under colorful awnings. The air smells of woodsmoke, fresh bread, and something metallic, like blacksmith forges nearby.

Heart pounding, you duck into a narrow alley, your mind racing. How did you get here? Was it that strange app on your phone last night, or just a vivid nightmare? But it feels too real—the chill of the stone wall against your back, the distant clang of a church bell tolling the hour. You spot a tailor’s shop at the alley’s end and slip inside, trading your sneakers for rough leather boots and a simple woolen tunic that itches against your skin. The tailor eyes you curiously but says nothing, muttering about "outlandish travelers from afar."

Emerging disguised, you wander deeper into the town, past thatched-roof taverns where minstrels strum lutes and ale flows freely. Hunger gnaws at you, and you barter a shiny coin from your pocket (which, surprisingly, passes as "foreign gold") for a loaf of crusty bread and a tankard of watery mead. As you eat, you overhear whispers of a great quest: a legendary artifact hidden in the misty mountains, said to grant the power to bend time itself. Could this be your way home? Or is the dream pulling you deeper into its web?

Emboldened, you join a ragtag group of adventurers at the tavern— a grizzled knight, a sly thief, and a wise herbalist—who mistake you for a scholar from a distant land. Together, you set off at dawn, trekking through enchanted forests where trees whisper secrets and fireflies dance like stars fallen to earth. Along the way, illusions flicker: your smartphone briefly materializes in your hand, only to dissolve into mist. You battle shadowy beasts that shift like forgotten memories, and in a hidden cave, you confront a mirror that shows glimpses of your real life—your bed, your coffee mug, the hum of your alarm clock.

Finally, as you grasp the artifact—a glowing amulet pulsing with ethereal light—you feel the world tilt. The dream unravels in a swirl of colors, pulling you back. You jolt awake in your own bed, sweat-soaked and disoriented, the amulet's warmth lingering on your chest like a half-remembered promise. Was it just a dream... or did you bring a piece of it with you?
