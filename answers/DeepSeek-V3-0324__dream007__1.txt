...take a deep breath and step back for a moment. The air around you feels thick with tension, but you realize that this argument isn’t worth losing the friendship over. You look at your friend, seeing the frustration in their eyes—but also the care that’s always been there.  

Then, unexpectedly, the dream shifts. The world around you morphs into a surreal landscape—maybe a vast, misty forest or a floating city under a twilight sky. The argument fades, replaced by a strange sense of wonder. Your friend is still there, but now you’re both standing before a bridge made of glowing threads, stretching into the unknown.  

A voice—maybe yours, maybe something else—whispers: *"Cross it together, or not at all."*  

Do you:  
1. **Take their hand and step onto the bridge**, trusting that the journey will mend things between you?  
2. **Stay where you are**, afraid that moving forward might make things worse?  
3. **Wake up abruptly**, heart pounding, unsure if the dream was a warning or a revelation?  

(What happens next?)
