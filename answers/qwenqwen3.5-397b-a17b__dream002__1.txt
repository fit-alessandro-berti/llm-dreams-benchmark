...and the sky bruises purple. But there is no wind. The leaves stop moving, frozen in mid-tremble, hanging from the branches like painted ornaments. The thunder doesn't rumble; it chimes, resonating deep in your chest like a silver bell dropped on stone.

You realize you aren't afraid. In fact, you feel lighter, as if your bones have turned to hollow reeds. You open your hands, palms up, waiting for the rain. The first drop falls. It isn't water. It's liquid light, warm and humming with a low vibration. Where it touches your skin, you remember things you forgot—the name of a street you lived on twenty years ago, the smell of a book you lost, the feeling of flying.

The trees begin to dissolve into mist, not disappearing, but becoming part of the air you breathe. You try to speak to call out, but your voice comes out as a flock of blue jays. They scatter from your lips into the darkening clouds, which are now opening like great heavy velvet curtains.

Behind them is not more sky, but a bedroom ceiling, familiar and quiet. The storm was just the transition. You blink, and the forest is gone, but you still smell the ozone and pine on your pillows, and your hands are still warm.
