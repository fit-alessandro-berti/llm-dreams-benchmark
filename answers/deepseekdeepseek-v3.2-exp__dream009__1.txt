...find a way to survive. The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth. You're wearing rough-spun clothes, and the cobblestone street under your bare feet is cold and uneven. A man leading a cart drawn by a tired-looking horse gives you a curious glance, his own clothes patched and worn.

You wander, your mind racing. No phone, no internet, no electricity. The sheer, silent absence of the digital hum you've lived with your entire life is a physical weight. You see a public well, and the reality of your thirst hits you. You need water, shelter, food.

As you cup your hands to drink the cool, metallic-tasting water, you notice a posted decree on a nearby board. The parchment is brittle, the script ornate. It's dated 1347.

A cold dread, deeper than any you've ever felt, washes over you. You don't just need to find food and a bed. You need to get out of this year. You need to get as far away from Europe as possible. Because you know, with the chilling clarity that only a dream can provide, what is coming. The shadow is already here. The Great Mortality. The Black Death.

Your dream isn't about adapting. It's a race against a microscopic clock. You have knowledge, but no resources. You have foresight, but no one will believe a stranger babbling about invisible "germs." Your new life, which has just begun, is already measured in weeks, unless you can complete the one task that matters now: **escape.**
