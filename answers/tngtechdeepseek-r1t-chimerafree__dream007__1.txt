You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to you both, and you decide to raise your voice, the words sharp and unyielding. Suddenly, the air around you crackles with tension, and the room begins to dissolve—walls melting like wax, the floor softening beneath your feet. Your friend’s angry words warp into a language you don’t recognize, syllables bending like rubber.  

Then, silence.  

You find yourselves standing in a vast, sunlit field, the argument still hanging in the air like smoke. A deer steps delicately into the space between you, its antlers threaded with vines and glowing fireflies. It stares at you both, unblinking, as if waiting. Without warning, your friend laughs—a startled, genuine sound—and you realize you’re holding a single red poppy, though you don’t remember picking it.  

The dream lingers there, unresolved, but the anger is gone. Only the poppy remains, petals trembling in a breeze you can’t quite feel.  

When you wake, the details blur, but the weight of the flower in your palm feels impossibly real.
