You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need **to find shelter before the twin suns dip below the horizon.**

The air smells of ozone and crushed lavender, a scent unlike anything from your time. You are standing in a valley where the grass shimmers with a faint, bioluminescent pulse, reacting to your footsteps. In the distance, towering spires of crystal rise from the earth, humming a low, resonant frequency that you can feel in your bones rather than hear with your ears. There are no roads, no wires, no hum of engines—only the rustle of wind through silver-leaved trees and the distant call of a creature that sounds like shifting glass.

Panic begins to rise in your chest as you check your pockets instinctively: no phone, no watch, no wallet. Just the clothes on your back. But as the sky begins to shift from a soft amber to a deep, bruising violet, you notice the temperature dropping rapidly. The shimmering grass dims as the light fades, and the humming from the crystal spires grows louder, almost urgent.

You spot a small, dome-shaped structure nestled among the roots of a massive tree nearby. It looks abandoned, woven from living vines and hardened clay. With the twin suns nearly gone and strange, shadowy movements starting to stir in the treeline, you realize survival here depends not on what you know about the future, but on how quickly you can adapt to the rhythms of this ancient, breathing world. You sprint toward the vine-dome, hoping it offers protection against whatever wakes when the light dies.
