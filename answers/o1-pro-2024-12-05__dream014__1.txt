…and you accept their help, albeit cautiously at first. They don’t seem bothered by your hesitation; in fact, their smiles only broaden, as if they’ve been expecting you all along. The city around you is all swirling motion—neon lights that fade into one another, intersecting streets that double back in loops—and for a moment you suspect it might not even be a city at all, but some elaborate puzzle designed to confuse you. The strangers—three of them, each dressed in colors that feel comforting, like pastel blues and soft yellows—guide you through a narrow alley into a courtyard you hadn’t noticed before.

In this courtyard, the noise of the city drifts into a distant hush. The tall buildings still loom overhead, but here the space is calm, infused with the scent of warm bread and a distant melody of string instruments. One of your guides offers you a cup of hot tea in a delicate porcelain mug. As you sip, you feel that the warmth filling your chest isn’t just from the tea; it’s from a sense of understanding that these people truly see you and want to help you. Another guide spreads a crinkled paper map on a low stone bench. As you glance at it, the lines and intersections begin to shift subtly, rearranging themselves. The map seems alive, reflecting your own growing clarity. It’s as if it’s responding to your state of mind—your anxieties, your hopes—transforming into something legible and reassuring.

The third guide—quiet, with kind eyes—points to a spot on the map. When you look closely, you see that it’s marked with a symbol you can’t quite decipher. But you understand the meaning nonetheless: it’s your place, your path. The guides don’t speak a language you recognize, yet their gestures and expressions communicate everything you need. You realize that your destination isn’t a single point on a grid, but a feeling of home that you carry within yourself. They’re showing you how to read the city as a reflection of your inner landscape: the confusion and clutter are simply unexamined corners of your own soul.

You turn to thank them, but as you do, their shapes grow soft around the edges, and the courtyard’s stone walls and tinkling music begin to blur. You find yourself standing again among strangers, but this time, the throng of the city’s streets doesn’t frighten you. There is a quiet confidence in your stride now. You know where you need to go—not because someone gave you directions, but because you’ve finally learned to navigate the chaos of the world by recognizing the stillness inside yourself.

Just as you take a step forward, the scene dissolves like ink in water, and you wake up…carrying the memory of kind strangers and shifting maps, and the certainty that you can find your way, no matter where you are.
