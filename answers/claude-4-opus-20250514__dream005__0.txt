...the floor beneath you becomes soft and spongy, like walking on clouds. Each group you approach seems to be speaking in a language that shifts just as you begin to understand it - first English, then something melodic and unknown, then pure color that somehow makes perfect sense.

You spot your friend across the room, but as you move toward them, the crowd thickens impossibly, people multiplying like cells dividing. Their faces are familiar but wrong - your third-grade teacher with your dentist's smile, your mailman with your mother's eyes.

Suddenly you realize you're holding something important in your pocket, but you can't remember what it is. When you reach for it, your hand passes through fabric like water. The ceiling has become a starry sky, and everyone at the party is now looking up, pointing at a constellation that spells out something urgent you can't quite read.

Your friend finally sees you and waves, but when they call your name, it echoes backwards through time, and you realize you've been at this party before, will be at this party again, and the important thing in your pocket - you remember now - is a key to a door you haven't found yet.

The music stops. Everyone turns to look at you, waiting.
