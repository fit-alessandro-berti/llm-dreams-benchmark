each group feels like stepping into a different little world.  

One circle is laughing loudly around a magician who’s pulling tiny, wriggling fish from behind people’s ears. Another group is gathered around a massive map laid out on the floor, arguing about the best way to sail to the moon. Someone hands you a glass of something that smells like starlight and sea-salt, and you thank them without thinking, though the drink shimmers between solid and liquid.

As you weave through the crowd, the atmosphere shifts: now it's a room lit entirely by floating lanterns, each one containing a miniature thunderstorm. You swear you see a few familiar faces flicker within the lightning.

You finally spot your friend at the far end of a hallway that seems to stretch and sway like a living thing. They're waving you over with both arms, calling your name, but the hallway keeps shifting, pulling you into new little vignettes—a ballroom where everyone’s dancing barefoot on clouds, a library where the books are whispering their contents directly into eager ears.

You run, but the ground feels soft and slow, like running through honey. Your friend is smiling wider now, and behind them, a massive door is opening, a bright, warm light spilling out—  
and just as you reach out to grab their hand—  

the dream changes.  

Would you like me to keep going from there?
