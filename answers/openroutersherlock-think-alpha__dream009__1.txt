You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to **blend in fast—or risk being burned as a witch**.

The air smells of woodsmoke and damp earth, and the cobblestone streets of this medieval village hum with the clatter of horse-drawn carts and the chatter of peasants in rough woolen tunics. Your jeans and t-shirt scream "outsider," drawing suspicious glances from ruddy-faced farmers hauling baskets of turnips. A church bell tolls ominously in the distance, and you spot a wooden pillory in the square, where a man is being pelted with rotten vegetables for some petty crime.

Heart pounding, you duck into a shadowy alley and rummage through a pile of discarded rags, fashioning a hasty cloak from a threadbare blanket. Your sneakers won't do—you kick them off and wrap your feet in strips of cloth, mimicking the leather-wrapped feet of the locals. Hunger gnaws at you, but first things first: survival.

Emerging, you approach a baker's stall, where loaves of coarse brown bread steam in the chill morning air. "A penny for a loaf, good sir?" the stout woman grunts, eyeing your strange accent. You pat your empty pockets—damn, no coins from 2024 work here. Improvising, you spot a loose horseshoe nearby and offer it as trade. She squints, then nods grudgingly. Score one for bartering.

As the day unfolds, you weave through the market: dodging plague-masked healers hawking dubious potions, eavesdropping on tales of a brewing war with some distant king, and even joining a group of children playing with wooden swords. But whispers follow you—"Demon eyes! Foreign tongue!"—and by dusk, a hooded inquisitor on horseback eyes you from the tavern doorway.

Night falls, and you huddle in a hayloft, stomach full of pilfered apples, mind racing. Is this time travel? A curse? Then, a shimmering light pierces the dream-weave: your alarm clock buzzes faintly from another world. You jolt awake in your bed, sheets tangled, phone glowing on the nightstand.

...Or do you? The hay scratches your skin. The bell tolls again. Maybe the dream's not over yet. What do you do next?
