You decide to channel the raw energy of the argument into something utterly absurd, because in dreams, logic is just a suggestion. Instead of shouting back, you grab your friend's hand—rough and calloused from years of shared adventures—and pull them toward the rickety wooden dock at the edge of the lake that's suddenly materialized behind you both. The argument was about the future, wasn't it? Whether to chase the wild, untamed path of spontaneity or the steady glow of certainty. Words had flown like arrows, each one stinging deeper than the last, but now the water laps at your feet, ink-black and whispering secrets.

"Jump with me," you say, your voice steady despite the fire in your chest. They hesitate, eyes wide with that mix of fury and fear you know so well, but then they nod. Together, you leap into the void.

The fall isn't a plummet—it's a glide. The lake doesn't swallow you; it parts like silk, revealing a hidden world below. Schools of silver fish dart around you like living constellations, and the argument unravels into bubbles that rise and pop into laughter. Your friend's face, distorted by the water's embrace, softens into a grin. You both surface in a meadow of glowing lotuses, the sun a lazy peach in the sky, and the weight of the disagreement dissolves like mist.

But dreams twist, don't they? As you lie there, side by side, the lotuses bloom into maps—endless routes branching out, neither wild nor certain, but both at once. Your friend points to one path, you to another, and instead of arguing, you fold the map into a paper boat. It sails away on a breeze that smells like forgiveness and fresh rain, carrying the unspoken promise: we'll find our way, together or apart, but always with this.

You wake with the echo of their laugh in your ears, the argument a faint scar that feels more like a story than a wound. What happens next in your dream?
