…speak, but instead of words, a shimmering ribbon of light pours from your mouth and unspools above the stage. The ribbon twists into glowing letters that hover in the air, spelling out the very thoughts you meant to say—only more vivid, pulsing with color and emotion. Gasps ripple through the audience, yet no one seems surprised; they lean forward as though this is exactly what they came to witness.

Suddenly, one of the letters detaches, fluttering down like a luminous feather. When it brushes the wooden floorboards, the entire stage tilts gently, as if it were a raft on a calm sea. You feel the floor swell beneath your feet, rocking you into a slow, buoyant rhythm. The auditorium’s walls dissolve into a wide horizon of twilight sky, streaked with rose and indigo. The seats become neat rows of lotus blossoms floating on mirrored water, each audience member now seated cross‑legged atop a flower, still watching you with serene anticipation.

You realize your “speech” is no longer confined to language—it is an unfolding landscape. You raise your hand, and the air thickens into soft clay, waiting for shape. With a sweeping gesture you sculpt a bridge of moonlight that arcs from the edge of the stage to the furthest row of blossoms. One by one, the listeners rise and walk across it, their footsteps leaving musical notes that drift upward like bubbles and burst into constellations overhead.

As they reach you, each person places a small, translucent stone at your feet—gifts of their own unspoken dreams. The stones hum and resonate, aligning themselves into a mosaic at the center of the stage. When the final stone clicks into place, the mosaic ignites, revealing a door made entirely of sunrise colors. A gentle wind urges you forward; the audience nods in unanimous encouragement.

You step through the door and find yourself standing on the back of a giant, slow‑moving turtle gliding across a starlit ocean. The ribbon of light that once carried your words now coils around your wrist like a friendly comet, guiding you toward an island that shimmers on the horizon. You sense that the real speech—the one that unites every voice in the world—is waiting there, written in the waves and the wind.

You take a deep breath of salt‑sweet air, feeling no fear, only the thrill of discovery. The turtle’s shell echoes with distant applause that blends into the hush of the sea, and you sail onward, speaking in light, carried by the dream to wherever the next sentence wishes to be born.
