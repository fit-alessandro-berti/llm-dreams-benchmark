…various groups of people and each circle seems to obey its own private physics, as though the ballroom has been sliced into overlapping worlds.

1. The Whispering Archivists  
Close to the coat check, a semicircle of elders in velvet jackets huddle around a trunk full of envelopes. When you drift near, they stop mid‑sentence and press the envelopes to their ears, as if listening to seashells. One hands you an envelope addressed in your handwriting to “The Person I Will Become.” You slit it open, but the paper inside is blank except for the faint scent of petrichor—rain on dry earth—your favorite smell as a child. You want to ask what it means, but the archivists have already filed themselves into the trunk and latched it shut from the inside.

2. The Dancers Without Music  
Farther on, the parquet floor tilts like the deck of a slow‑breathing ship. Dozens of guests glide through intricate waltz steps, yet no music plays. Their shoes tap out the rhythm—heel, toe, toe—until the taps fuse into a single heartbeat under your ribs. One dancer breaks formation, bows, and offers you an imaginary violin. When you tuck it under your chin, the room floods with a melody you don’t actually hear; you feel it instead, like warm water around your ankles. The dancers applaud soundlessly, then scatter like dandelion seeds, leaving polished floorboards that reflect a sky full of constellations where the ceiling ought to be.

3. The Table of Unfinished Sentences  
In a side lounge you find a banquet table where guests balance crystal goblets on the edges of incomplete thoughts:  
“I always meant to tell you that if—”  
“Someday we should go back to the place where we—”  
“I never realized how much it mattered until—”  
Their sentences trail off, dangling out over a dark, quiet gulf. You add your own: “When I finally see you again—” The words hover in midair like frosted breath, waiting for an ending you cannot supply. A waiter in a suit of newspaper clippings sweeps them onto a silver tray and whispers, “We’ll keep these on hold.”

4. The Mirror Garden  
A corridor lined with beaded curtains opens onto a garden lit by chandelier moons. Mirrors grow on vines like glass fruit. In each reflection you spot your friend—sometimes laughing, sometimes turning away, sometimes mouthing words you can’t hear. You attempt to step through the nearest mirror, only to ripple its surface like pond water. On the other side you see yourself searching through crowds of strangers; apparently you are both hunter and quarry. When you reach to touch your double, your fingers meet only cool air and the faint ticking of unseen clocks.

5. The Cartographer of Lost People  
At last, in a quiet alcove beneath a spiral staircase, an aging cartographer inks labyrinths onto parchment that unrolls across the floor. Cities morph into fingerprints; rivers loop into question marks. You spot your own name written where two roads intersect, but it’s smudged, as if erased and redrawn too many times. “I’m looking for someone,” you tell the cartographer. He nods without glancing up and hands you a compass whose needle spins like a coin. “North is wherever your longing is loudest,” he says. “But be quick—the map revises itself when no one watches.”

The Search Concludes  
Clutching the restless compass, you push open a final set of doors and step onto a balcony that shouldn’t exist—it hangs over a calm, star‑dark ocean although the building is landlocked. Your friend stands at the railing, back turned, hair stirred by a breeze that smells of both saltwater and library dust. Relief bursts in your chest. You reach out—then notice the compass has stopped spinning; its needle points directly at you.

Your friend turns. It is you, older by an unreadable number of years, eyes bright with recognition. Neither of you speaks. Instead, the older you reaches into a pocket and pulls out the letter you received from the Whispering Archivists, now filled with handwriting:  
“I am here. You found me. Keep looking.”  

A sudden swell of waves—or applause—rises from below. The balcony tilts, the constellations rearrange themselves into an arrow, and the dream folds like paper around a hidden message. You wake just as the envelope slips from your hand, still smelling of rain on dry earth.
