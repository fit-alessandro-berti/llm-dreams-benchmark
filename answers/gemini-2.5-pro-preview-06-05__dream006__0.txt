...speak, but instead of words, a stream of shimmering, silent bubbles emerges from my mouth. They float out over the audience, catching the stage lights like tiny, iridescent planets. I try again, desperate to deliver my opening line, but more bubbles pour out, faster this time.

The crowd doesn't seem to mind. In fact, they look delighted. A man in the front row with a magnificent mustache reaches out and pops one. The moment it bursts, the distinct sound of a cat purring fills the air for a second, then vanishes. A woman a few rows back pops another, and we all hear the gentle fizz of a freshly opened soda can.

My panic begins to morph into curiosity. I concentrate, thinking of a specific sound—a bicycle bell. I purse my lips and blow, and a single, large bubble detaches and floats towards the center of the hall. A young boy stands on his chair to pop it, and a cheerful *ding-ding!* echoes through the auditorium. The crowd applauds.

This is my speech. I am a conductor of a sound-bubble orchestra.

I get into a rhythm, thinking of sounds and releasing them into the air. A crackling campfire. A distant train whistle. The crinkle of a turning page. The audience is my instrument, popping the bubbles to release the symphony. It's beautiful.

Then I notice the lectern beside me is not made of wood, but of stacked, slightly wobbly encyclopedias. The microphone is actually a wilting tulip. I lean in to smell it, and its petals suddenly wrap around my nose, soft and cool. When they unfurl, the audience is gone.

The vast, empty hall is now a forest clearing at dusk. The seats have become ancient, moss-covered stones. The stage is a small, grassy knoll. I am barefoot, and the speech notes still clutched in my hand have turned into a handful of smooth, warm river rocks.

A stag with antlers tangled in constellations steps gracefully from between two trees. It looks at me with intelligent, ancient eyes. It doesn't speak, but I understand the question perfectly. It wants to know what I was going to say.

I look down at the river rocks in my palm. I open my mouth, feeling the familiar pressure build, but I know it won't be bubbles this time. I take a deep breath, and I begin to sing a song I've never heard before, in a language I do not know, and the stones in my hand begin to glow, one by one, lighting the path for the stag into the deepening twilight.
