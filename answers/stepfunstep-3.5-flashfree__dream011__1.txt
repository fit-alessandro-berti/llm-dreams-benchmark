written in a language you don’t recognize—swirling symbols that seem to shift as you look at them. The exam room is silent, but the air hums with a low, resonant frequency that vibrates in your teeth. The instructor, an indistinct figure at the front, doesn’t speak—only gestures toward the paper before you.

As you try to focus, the symbols begin to rearrange themselves. They’re not foreign; they’re *familiar*. They form fragments of your own memories—the smell of your childhood kitchen, the exact shade of your first love’s eyes, the weight of a letter you never sent. Each “question” is a scene from your life, but with a key detail altered. The kitchen is on fire. The eyes are strangers’. The letter is addressed to you, from your future self.

You realize with a growing dread—and a flicker of understanding—that the exam isn’t testing your knowledge. It’s testing your ability to *recognize* the pattern. To see how every altered moment, every “wrong” detail, is actually a turning point you glossed over, a choice you buried, a path not taken.

The paper grows warm. The symbols now look less like writing and more like roots, or like the branching of a neural network. You feel a pull—not to answer, but to *remember*. The final line, when it solidifies in your mind, isn’t a question at all.

It’s an invitation:

**“What will you choose to become, now that you remember all that you are?”**

You look up. The instructor is gone. The other students are gone. The room is just a room, empty except for a single chair and the paper before you—now blank, waiting. And outside the window, a path you’ve never seen before, winding into a dawn that feels both terrifying and completely your own.

You wake with your heart pounding, the echo of that blank page still before your eyes, and the profound, unsettling feeling that the exam… is just beginning.
