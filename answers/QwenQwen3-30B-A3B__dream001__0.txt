You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to run, your footsteps echoing through streets that seem to stretch infinitely in all directions. The buildings around you are impossibly tall, their facades shifting like living murals—gargoyles morphing into birds, windows opening to reveal starry skies. A clock tower in the distance chimes, but its hands spin backward, and you notice your watch is frozen at 9:59.  

You approach a street vendor selling glowing maps, but when you ask for directions, they hand you a blank parchment that fills with cryptic symbols only when you blink. A child in a tuxedo appears beside you, whispering, *“Follow the shadows, but don’t let them touch your feet.”* You obey, but the shadows twist into serpents, coiling around your ankles. You kick them off, stumbling into a plaza where a bridge of mirrors spans a chasm. Each reflection shows a different version of yourself—some smiling, others weeping. You step onto the bridge, and it shudders, collapsing behind you.  

A figure in a moth-eaten coat materializes, holding a key that hums with static. *“The meeting is in the heart of the city,”* they say, *“but the heart is a labyrinth. You’ll need to lose yourself to find it.”* They vanish, and the streets rearrange. You’re now in a corridor of towering bookshelves, each tome pulsating like a heartbeat. You pull one free, and it opens to a page that reads: *“The meeting is not a place, but a choice.”*  

As the clock’s backward chime crescendos, you realize the city is a mirror of your own anxieties—your fear of failure, your uncertainty. You close the book, and the labyrinth dissolves. Suddenly, you’re standing before a door marked *“Now.”* You push it open to find yourself in a sunlit room, empty except for a single chair. A voice says, *“You’re late.”*  

You look up—and see your own face smiling back from a mirror on the wall. The dream shifts, and you wake up, drenched in sweat, your phone showing 10:01 AM. The meeting was a reminder for a deadline you’d forgotten. But in the back of your mind, the city lingers, waiting.
