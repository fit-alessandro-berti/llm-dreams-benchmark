# The Captain's Choice

The wind howls like a wounded beast, tearing at your voice as you shout orders to your crew. Salt spray crashes over the bow, soaking everything in its path. The mast groans beneath the assault of gale force winds.

"Hard to starboard!" you bellow, gripping the wheel with white-knuckled determination. The ship heeled dangerously, water flooding the deck, but you hold your course.

Your crew moves with desperate efficiency—sailors scramble to adjust the rigging, others pump furiously at the bilges. A young deckhand slips near the rail, and you reach out without thinking, hauling him back to safety. His eyes meet yours, wide with fear, and in them you see something that steadies your own heart: trust.

The clouds above seem to twist and churn, lit occasionally by jagged lightning that reveals the monstrous waves around you. The compass spins wildly, but you've sailed these waters before—in this life or another, you cannot tell anymore.

Then, in the distance, you see it: a thin line of lighter darkness on the horizon. The storm's edge. Dawn breaking through.

"Every last ounce of strength!" you call out. "We make for the eye! Now!"

The ship surges forward, cresting a massive wave that threatens to swallow you whole—

And you wake.

But the strange thing is, you still feel the wheel in your hands, the salt on your lips. For a moment, you almost miss it.

What would you have done differently, if you could sail that dream again?
