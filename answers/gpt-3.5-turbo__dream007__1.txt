take a step back and calm down before continuing the conversation. You take a deep breath and try to remember that your friend's perspective is just as valid as yours. As you listen to their side of the argument, you start to see things from a different point of view. You realize that there is room for compromise and understanding. 

You apologize for getting so worked up and suggest finding a solution that works for both of you. Your friend also agrees to let go of their anger and work towards a resolution together. The tension between you dissipates as you both make an effort to communicate openly and honestly. In the end, you come to a mutual understanding and strengthen your friendship through this challenging experience.
