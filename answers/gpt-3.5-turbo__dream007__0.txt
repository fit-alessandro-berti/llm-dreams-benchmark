 pause and take a breath. You realize that the argument is escalating and neither of you are truly listening to each other. 

In that moment, you choose to set aside your pride and ego, and instead focus on understanding your friend's perspective. You both take a step back and begin to truly listen to each other's thoughts and feelings. 

As the conversation continues, you both start to see where the other person is coming from and begin to find common ground. You both apologize for any hurtful words said in the heat of the moment and start to work towards a resolution that benefits both of you. 

By the end of the dream, you and your friend have not only resolved the disagreement but have also strengthened your friendship through open communication and understanding. You wake up feeling grateful for the opportunity to improve your relationship and committed to bettering your communication skills in real life.
