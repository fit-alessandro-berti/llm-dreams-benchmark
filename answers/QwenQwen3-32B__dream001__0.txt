You start to panic, glancing at your watch—its hands are spinning wildly, defying time itself. The streets around you shift like liquid, buildings melting and reforming into new shapes as if the city is alive and amused by your desperation. A crowd of faceless figures in tailored suits shuffles past, murmuring in a language that flickers at the edge of comprehension. One stops abruptly, turns to you, and speaks in a voice like rustling paper: *"The address isn’t a place—it’s a question."*  

Before you can ask what that means, the ground tilts, and you tumble down a staircase that spirals upward into a sky choked with floating islands. Each island hosts a fragment of the city: a clock tower ticking backward, a library with books that scream when opened, a plaza where statues weep ink. You clutch the railing, noticing the steps are made of mirrors. In one reflection, you glimpse a door labeled *"When the Weight of Time Becomes the Wing of Time."*  

A sudden gust hurls you forward. You land in a courtyard where a giant, grinning sundial casts shadows that move independently, weaving into ladders, bridges, and—a key!—a path leading to a floating dais. There, a figure waits: you, but older, with eyes like storm clouds. *"You’ve always known how to find me,"* they say, offering a hand. *"But meetings are for those who’ve forgotten how to arrive."*  

As you reach out, the dream dissolves. You wake, breathless, unsure if you made the meeting—or if the meeting made *you*.
