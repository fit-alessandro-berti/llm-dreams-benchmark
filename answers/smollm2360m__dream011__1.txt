Yes! I understand the situation and am here to assist with the Dream Implementation Sequence. Here's how it would work:

1. Begin by setting up our Hiring Experience module using a specific template based on your current skillset in this case, like being an expert at problem-solving or analyzing data. 

2. We can start asking questions that relate to your previous career experiences and education. Based on these interactions, we can generate a list of relevant job titles and required educational credentials.

3. Once you've selected the required qualifications for the course, our system will automatically assess and verify the content of your answers in this module. This process is known as 'Knowledge Evaluation'. It ensures that your knowledge on the subjects they require is accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to their field.

4. The evaluation phase is crucial as it helps us decide which course or degree would be best for you. Our system will analyze these results in relation to your strengths and passions. 

5. Then, based on a pre-designed career plan, we can help you find the suitable courses/degrees that have been placed higher than yours in the 'Career Rank' list. We'll provide more detailed information about each course like their major, program length, average tuition costs etc., so you can make an informed decision. 

6. Our system is adaptable and will continue to learn your preferences over time based on how often you take courses at our company. 

So, the process should be as follows: Firstly, you fill in the required qualification information. The 'Knowledge Evaluation' will help assess if it's accurate. Following that, your skillset evaluation comes along. After this, we find suitable courses to check if they match your career aspirations. If a course is not found suitable or doesn't meet your requirements, our system informs the team about your decision, and you are given an option on how to proceed.

In terms of specific answers in the course module, you would fill-in questions based on your learning style using the prompts provided by Hugging Face System and that is what will lead us automatically through the selection process for your chosen course (course with a selected degree) based on our knowledge and understanding of your skills.
