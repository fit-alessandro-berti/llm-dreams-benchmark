suddenly stop talking. The words hang in the air between you, thick and sharp. You look at your friend’s face—the familiar lines of frustration, the hurt you never meant to cause—and you realize the argument isn’t about the *thing* anymore. It’s about the space growing between you, the fear that this might be the crack that finally splits something precious.

So you decide to **say nothing**. You take a breath, and instead of another sentence, you reach out and take their hand. Your touch is tentative at first, then sure. The world doesn’t fade, but the noise does. The kitchen around you—where you were shouting over the clatter of dishes—softens into a blur. There’s only the weight of their hand in yours, the warmth of it, and the sudden, quiet understanding that you are both holding the same fragile, important thing. You don’t need to win. You just need to hold on.

The dream shifts then. You’re no longer in the kitchen. You’re standing at the edge of a calm, dark lake at night, still holding hands. The argument is gone, but so are the words to fix it. All that’s left is the feeling—deep, cold, and clear as the water—and the shared decision to stay there, together in the silence, until the sun rises and shows you both the way forward.
