# The Dream Competition

You are participating in a competition where the grand prize is your dream job. As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and the boundaries between reality and fantasy begin to blur.

The first challenge takes place in a vast library where bookshelves stretch impossibly high. You must locate a specific book that contains the answer to advance, but every time you pull a volume from the shelf, the words rearrange themselves. Somehow, you discover that humming a melody from your childhood stabilizes the text.

The second challenge transports you to a kitchen where you must prepare a dish that represents your greatest strength. As you cook, the ingredients transform in your hands—flour becomes sand, then snow, then finally settles as stardust. Your creation glows with an inner light that judges appreciate despite not being able to taste it.

In the third challenge, you find yourself in a maze of mirrors. Each reflection shows a different version of your professional self—some successful, others failing, all possible futures. The only way forward is to acknowledge each version before the mirror shatters, leaving behind fragments that form a path.

The final challenge is the most perplexing. You stand before a panel of judges, but their faces keep shifting between those of significant people from your life—former teachers, mentors, family members. They ask questions that seem simple yet impossible: \ potential?\ warm sensation in your chest, and that your potential weighs exactly as much as your fears allow, something extraordinary happens. The room dissolves, and you're suddenly sitting at a desk that feels perfectly fitted to you. 

A document appears—your contract for the dream job—but as you reach to sign it, you realize the pen is writing your actual dreams onto the page rather than your signature. You understand, in that peculiar dream-logic way, that the competition wasn't for an existing job but to discover what truly fulfills you.

As you wake, fragments of the dream job linger in your mind, offering unexpected clarity about your real aspirations.
