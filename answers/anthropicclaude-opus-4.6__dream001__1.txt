# The Meeting

You start to walk, hoping some instinct will guide you, but the streets keep shifting. A road you swore ran north now curves back on itself like a question mark. Buildings rearrange themselves when you glance away—a cathedral trades places with a laundromat, a skyscraper folds down into a mailbox.

Your phone is in your hand, but the screen shows only water. Actual water, lapping gently against the glass, and when you tilt it, a tiny fish darts from one corner to another.

"Excuse me," you say to a woman at a bus stop. "Do you know where—"

"You're already late," she says, though you still have fifty-three minutes. She's knitting something enormous—a scarf or a road or a river—the yarn trailing off down the sidewalk and around corners, disappearing into the distance.

You follow the yarn. It feels right. It feels like the only solid thing in this city that won't rearrange itself.

The yarn leads you down an alley where the walls breathe—gently expanding and contracting like sleeping lungs. Through a park where the trees are growing in reverse, pulling their leaves back into their branches. Past a fountain that runs upward, water climbing into the sky and vanishing into a cloud that hovers just ten feet overhead.

You check the time. You still have fifty-three minutes.

You always have fifty-three minutes.

The yarn ends at a door. Just a door—no building, no wall, just a freestanding wooden door with a brass handle, standing in the middle of a cobblestone square. Behind it, you can see the same square continuing. There's no reason it should lead anywhere.

You knock.

"Come in," says your own voice from the other side.

You open the door and step into a room you've never seen but instantly recognize. It's warm. The light is the color of late afternoon in a place you lived as a child but can't quite name. There's a long table, and seated around it are people you almost know—faces assembled from fragments of everyone you've ever trusted. A teacher's eyes. A friend's laugh lines. A parent's hands.

At the head of the table, there's an empty chair.

"We've been waiting," says someone who looks like kindness distilled into a person. "Sit down."

"What's this meeting about?" you ask.

They all smile at the same time, and it doesn't feel eerie—it feels like sunrise.

"You called it," they say in unison. "Don't you remember?"

And as you sit down, you realize you do remember. The meeting isn't about a project or a deadline or anything you need to perform. It's the meeting you've been postponing for years—the one where you sit still long enough to be found by the parts of yourself you outran.

The clock on the wall has no numbers. Its hands move in slow circles like someone stirring honey.

You still have fifty-three minutes.

You finally have all the time you need.
