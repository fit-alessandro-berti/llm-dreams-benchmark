### **You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are…**

---

**…written in a language you’ve never seen before.**  
The symbols twist and coil like living vines across the page, shifting slightly whenever your eyes linger too long on them. Some appear to pulse faintly, as if breathing. At the top of the paper, instead of a course title, there’s only a single, glowing sigil that hums faintly in the silence of the exam hall.

You glance around the room. Every other student seems utterly calm—some even appear to be *answering* the questions with serene focus, their pencils moving in smooth, confident strokes. But when you try to look closer, their work flickers out of view, replaced by a soft white blur.

The clock on the wall ticks unnaturally slowly. Each second feels like it stretches into a full minute, and yet the exam is supposed to be over in just 30 minutes. Panic begins to claw at the edges of your mind.

Then, you notice something strange: the desk beneath your hands is not wood or plastic. It feels warm, almost organic, and when you press lightly, it gives—just slightly, like skin.

A whisper brushes past your ear, one you can’t quite make out. It isn’t spoken; it’s more like a thought inserted directly into your mind:  
**“Answer not with what you know… but with what you believe.”**

You look back at the first question. It has changed.

> **1. What is the sound of a single star crying?**  
> *(Choose one: A) A silent sob, B) The echo of a forgotten name, C) The hum of a distant engine, D) None of the above)*

You staring at the options, your heart pounding. You *know* none of this makes sense. But something deep inside you *feels* the answer.

### **What happens next in your dream?**

Would you like to continue the dream in a specific direction — **mystical**, **psychological**, **surreal**, or **action-packed**? Or shall I continue weaving the story from here?  

Let me know how you'd like to proceed…  

*(For example: Do you attempt to answer the question? Does the room begin to transform? Do you hear footsteps approaching? Or perhaps you wake up suddenly, heart racing…?)*
