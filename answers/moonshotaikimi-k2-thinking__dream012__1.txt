...climb to the quarterdeck, gripping the wheel that pulses like a living heart in my hands. The sky has split open, revealing not clouds but layers of memory—my mother's face, a boyhood lake, the first time I learned that "anchored" is just another word for "waiting to be moved."

"Steady as she goes!" I shout, but the words tumble backward into my throat, tasting of salt and iron. The crew moves in that strange dream-rhythm, their faces both familiar and utterly foreign. One man has my father's eyes. Another wears the smile of a lover I lost a decade ago. They pull ropes that stretch into darkness, anchoring us to stars that shouldn't be visible through the storm.

The wave that rises before us isn't water—it's every decision I've ever made, cresting. I can see the fossilized regrets and triumphant moments frozen in its translucent curve. "Helm a-lee!" I cry, though I've forgotten what it means. The wheel screams as I turn it, and the ship responds not with wood and canvas but with the sound of a thousand doors slamming shut.

Lightning cracks, and in the flash, I see the truth: we're sailing across the ceiling of my childhood bedroom. The constellations are glow-in-the-dark stickers. The storm is the sound of my own breathing, ragged and asleep. The crew—they're just shadows I've cast to avoid being alone with myself.

"Captain?" a voice whispers, and I turn to see the newest deckhand. She has my daughter's face, but younger than she is now, younger than she'll ever be again. "You can wake up," she says gently, taking my hand from the wheel. "The storm only exists because you believe it does."

The sea freezes mid-roar. The ship hangs suspended. And I realize I've been holding my breath this entire time.

I let go. The water doesn't swallow us—it simply... forgets. And I begin to fall upward, into the dark that isn't dark at all, just the space behind my eyelids, fluttering open.
