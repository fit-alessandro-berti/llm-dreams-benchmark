You find yourself navigating narrow corridors of shifting walls, where the puzzles evolve from simple riddles (like deciphering ancient symbols to open a stone door) to brain-bending enigmas that test your wit to the limit. One chamber demands you rearrange fractured constellations to unlock a celestial gate; another forces you to outmaneuver illusions of your own fears, solving logical paradoxes where time loops back on itself. As you delve further, the stakes rise—the air thickens with mystery, whispers of forgotten lore echoing off the walls, urging you on. Your mind sharpens with each victory, pieces of a grander truth assembling like a mosaic in the fog of your subconscious.

Suddenly, you spot a glowing exit at the maze's heart, guarded by a final puzzle: a labyrinth of mirrors reflecting infinite versions of yourself, each posing a question about dreams and reality. Answer correctly—"I am the dreamer and the dream"—and the reflections shatter, revealing the way out. You awaken, but was it truly an exit, or just the start of another layer?
