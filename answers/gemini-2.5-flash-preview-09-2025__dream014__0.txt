... and you **accept their offer, a wave of hesitant relief washing over you.**

The strangers do not pull out a map or hail a cab. Instead, they form a gentle circle around you, linking arms. They begin to move, not walking along the main street, but somehow drifting through the gaps in the crowd. The noise of the city, which had been a crushing weight of sound, begins to soften, muffling until it sounds like the distant churning of an ocean.

They lead you not to a recognizable landmark, but through an alleyway that opens not into another street, but into a silent, sun-drenched garden you know could not possibly exist in the heart of this metropolis. The air here smells of rain and ancient stone.

The strangers stop in front of a fountain where the water flows upward in shimmering sheets of gold light. One of them—a woman whose eyes are the color of moss after a spring shower—smiles and says, "The way you were seeking was never a direction. It was a space."

As she speaks, the golden light from the fountain intensifies, bathing you completely. You look down at your hands and see that the light has woven itself into your skin, like tiny, humming threads of certainty. You look back at the kind strangers, but their forms are beginning to dissolve, becoming transparent against the bright garden, merging with the sunlight and the quiet.

The weight of being lost is gone, replaced by a crystalline clarity. You realize you are not alone; you are simply *there*. You turn and step toward the edge of the garden, which now looks out onto a familiar, quiet street—your street.

**You smile, knowing the city is still loud and sprawling, but the path is clear, and you wake up.**
