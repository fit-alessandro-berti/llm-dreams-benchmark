…improvise in a world that has never heard of electricity, never seen glass that isn’t cloudy and warped. The air smells of damp earth and woodsmoke. You pat your pockets and find only the soft lining of a coat you don’t recognize.

The village nearby is a ring of low roofs and wary faces. They stare at your strange clothes as you stumble in, and you realize you have no map, no money, no name that matters here. You need shelter, food, a way to be understood — and most of all, you need to make yourself useful.

You trade your boots for a crust of bread and spend the night in a barn, listening to horses breathe and the slow drip of rain through the rafters. In the morning, you notice a broken water wheel by the river, a miller swearing at it. Your hands remember things your mind doesn’t: leverage, balance, the simple magic of a wedge. You wedge a stone under the shaft and, slowly, the wheel turns. The miller blinks at you as if you’ve summoned it.

Soon you are the curious stranger who can fix things with nothing but scraps and patience. You sketch a crude distillation coil for the apothecary. You draw a rough map for the old soldier who’s been lost in the forest for years. You teach a child to read using charcoal and a plank.

The nights are long and filled with candlelight, but you begin to dream not of your old world, but of this one — of how to survive here, how to earn trust, how to plant small seeds of change. When you finally climb the hill above the village and look out at fields broken only by smoke and sun, you understand: you don’t need to return to the future. You need to build a place for yourself in the past.

And in the center of that realization, a faint chiming begins, like a far-off alarm. You close your eyes, unsure if you want to wake up.
