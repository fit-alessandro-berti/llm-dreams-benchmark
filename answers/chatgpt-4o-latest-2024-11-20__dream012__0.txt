stand at the helm, gripping the wheel tightly as the ship lurches and groans under the pressure of the roaring waves. The air is thick with the smell of salt and the crackle of lightning streaking across the night sky. Your crew’s terrified faces reflect the chaos around you, but you force yourself to appear composed. Leadership isn't about never feeling fear—it’s about not letting it show.

"All hands on deck!" you shout over the howling wind. Your voice cuts through the storm like a blade, steady and commanding. "Brace for starboard! Secure the sails!" Your first mate, a seasoned sailor who’s stood by your side through countless voyages, nods grimly and begins relaying your orders to the rest of the crew.

As you steer into the towering waves, your mind races. This is no ordinary storm—it feels almost alive, malevolent. The ship's compass spins wildly, useless in the face of the tempest. Out of the corner of your eye, you notice something glowing faintly beneath the water, like a living light pulsing in time with the thunderclaps. The crew hasn’t spotted it yet, but you feel a strange pull from within, as if the light is beckoning you.

“Captain, the sails are tearing!” someone cries. You snap back to the reality of the moment. Shaking off the trance, you shout, “Cut them loose if you have to! We’ll ride the storm bare-masted if it comes to that!”

But even as you speak the words, the ship groans louder—a deep, mournful sound that reverberates down to your bones. The glow beneath the waves intensifies. Now your crew sees it too, and murmurs of fear ripple among them.

“Sir,” your first mate whispers, stepping closer, “that light… it’s not natural. It’s not of this world.”

You glance at him, but before you can respond, a colossal wave rises before you, impossibly high. For a moment, the world seems to pause in hushed anticipation. Then it crashes down, and everything goes black.

When you come to, the storm has quieted, but your ship is no longer moving. It sits still, motionless, surrounded by a strange, ethereal fog that glows with the same unearthly light you saw beneath the water. The sea is glassy and calm, yet has an unsettling depth, as though it might swallow you whole at any moment.

You stand, groggy but determined, and look around. Not all of your crew is accounted for. Those who remain stare in horror at the water, whispering about sirens, lost souls, and vengeful gods. You notice something strange in the air—a faint melody, haunting yet beautiful, that seems to emanate from all directions at once.

What do you do, Captain? The choice is yours, and your fate—and that of your crew—hangs in the balance.
