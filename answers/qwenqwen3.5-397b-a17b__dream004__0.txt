...and you realize it is the only still thing in existence. While the sky above ripples like oil on water and the ground breathes in soft, geometric pulses, the canvas stands rigid on an easel made of frozen smoke.

You reach for a brush, but none is there. Instead, you dip your finger into the air, and it comes away coated in liquid starlight. As you touch the white surface, the canvas hums—a low vibration that you feel in your teeth.

You don't paint an image; you paint a feeling. A stroke of deep indigo brings the scent of rain on hot asphalt. A swirl of burning gold injects the sound of laughter from a room you haven't entered in years. The shapes around you stop their chaotic shifting to watch. They are drawn to the creation, orbiting the easel like moths.

As you add the final touch—a small, red door in the center of the abstract storm—the canvas ripples. It is no longer a flat surface; it has depth. The red door handle turns on its own.

You understand, with the absolute certainty of a dreamer, that if you open the door, you will not wake up, but you will forget this place forever. If you leave it closed, the dream will continue, but the colors will never stop changing.

Your hand hovers over the knob. The world holds its breath.

You turn the handle.

The door swings open to reveal your own bedroom ceiling, gray and familiar in the early morning light. The scent of rain and gold fades, replaced by the smell of laundry detergent and dust. You blink, the image of the red door dissolving into the texture of your pillowcase. You are awake, but as you lift your hand to rub your eyes, you notice a single smear of wet, indigo paint on your thumb.
