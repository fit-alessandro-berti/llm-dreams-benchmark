feel a flutter of nerves in your stomach, but as your eyes meet the faces in the crowd, you take a deep breath and let the familiar words flow from your lips. Your voice starts softly, almost a whisper, but with each sentence, you grow more confident. The audience leans in, captivated by the story you're weaving. You share a personal anecdote, and a ripple of laughter and connection sweeps through the room. The spotlight feels warm on your face as you realize you're not just speaking at them, but with them, sharing in a moment of collective understanding. The dream fades just as you reach the most important part of your message, leaving you with a sense of fulfillment and anticipation.
