grip the ship’s wheel tightly, the cold rain blinding your vision as waves crash over the bow. Lightning etches jagged scars across the sky, illuminating the fear in your crew’s eyes. But beneath that fear, you see trust — an unspoken belief that you’ll guide them through.

"Hold fast!” you shout over the roar of the wind. "Reef the mainsail—secure the lines! We ride this through!”

Your first mate scrambles to your side, drenched and wide-eyed. “Captain, the compass—it’s spinning like mad. We’ve lost our heading!”

You glance at it, then at the stars briefly visible through the swirling clouds. You don’t need the compass. You feel the direction in your bones—it pulses through the wheel, calls to you from the sea itself.

“We’re not lost," you say. "We're being shown.”

As if answering your conviction, the storm suddenly shifts. The wind dies just enough to steady the sails. The sea, still unruly, seems to open a corridor through the waves — and ahead, a strange glow appears on the horizon. Not lightning. Something ancient, golden, and pulsing like a heartbeat.

A crewman approaches cautiously. “Captain… do you see that? What... what is it?”

You stare at the light. It calls to something deep inside you, something older than memory. You smile, eyes fixed on the glow.

“That," you say, voice low and sure, “is where we’ve been sailing all along.”

And the ship, with a creak of wood and a defiant surge forward, answers your command.
