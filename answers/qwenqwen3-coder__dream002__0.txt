...the wind begins to howl through the canopy above. Leaves swirl around you in a frenzied dance as the sky darkens from blue to an ominous green-gray. The peaceful chirping of birds is replaced by the distant rumble of thunder.

You quicken your pace, searching for shelter among the ancient trees. The forest floor, once soft with moss and fallen leaves, now feels slick with impending rain. Through the thickening mist, you spot what appears to be a small cottage nestled between two massive oaks - warm light flickering in its windows.

As you approach, the first heavy drops begin to fall. The storm unleashes its full fury - rain pelting down in sheets, lightning illuminating the forest in stark white flashes. But the cottage door stands invitingly open, and you can smell something comforting - perhaps wood smoke and fresh bread - drawing you toward its threshold...

*[The dream could continue from here - would you like to step into that cottage, or take the dream in a different direction?]*
