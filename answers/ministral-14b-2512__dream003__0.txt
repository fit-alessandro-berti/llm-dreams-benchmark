**The Dream Unfolds:**

The box hums faintly beneath your fingertips, its surface shifting like liquid silver under the dim glow of a candle you didn’t light. The intricate patterns—twisting vines, constellations, and symbols you’ve seen in old books but never understood—pulse faintly, as if breathing. When you press your palm against the center, the metal grows warm, and the lock *clicks* open on its own.

Inside, the box is not empty. It cradles a **mirror**, but not like any you’ve seen. The glass is black as a starless sky, and when you lean in, your reflection doesn’t stare back. Instead, it *moves*—a version of you from another time, standing in a ruined library, holding the same box. They mouth a single word: **"Remember."**

Before you can react, the mirror’s surface ripples, and suddenly you’re *there*—in the library, its shelves sagging under the weight of centuries, dust swirling like snow. The air smells of old parchment and something metallic, like blood left too long in the sun. The other-you sets the box down and turns to face you, their eyes wide with urgency.

*"They’re coming,"* they whisper. *"The ones who forget. They’ll take the box, and then you’ll never wake up."*

A shadow stretches across the floor—long, skeletal fingers tapping against the doorframe. The other-you shoves the box into your hands. *"Hide it. Not in your world. In the space between dreams."*

You wake up—

—**gasping**, your sheets tangled around you, the box now resting on your nightstand. But this time, the lock is gone. And when you open it, the mirror is empty… except for a single, fresh word scrawled in silver ink on the glass:

**"Find the key."**

*(Do you open the box again? Or do you search for the key first?)*
