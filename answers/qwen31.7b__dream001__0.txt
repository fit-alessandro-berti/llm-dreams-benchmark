You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to **panic, clutching your coat, as the labyrinth of alleys and towering structures looms around you**. The streets blur into a chaotic dance of neon lights and distorted reflections, and your heart races.  

You follow a faint, rhythmic pulse—a **subtle hum** from the air, like a trapped energy. It guides you, but the path is unclear. A **mirror hangs from a crumbling wall**, its surface reflecting not your face, but a **doppelgänger** of someone you recognize—a **woman in a coat, her eyes hollow**. She beckons you forward, but you stumble back, afraid to follow.  

Suddenly, a **door** appears, half-buried in rubble. You leap through, and the city shudders. Inside, a **hallway stretches endlessly**, lined with clocks that all point to **seven o’clock**. At the end, a **door opens** with a **siren’s wail**, and a figure in a **suit** stands there, **smiling**.  

“You’ve come,” the figure says. “The meeting is in the **mirror**.”  
You hesitate, but the **mirror’s reflection** reveals a **room** lined with **sickly green walls** and a **skeletal figure** whispering secrets. As you step inside, the city collapses behind you, and you wake, trembling, in your bed, the **siren’s sound** echoing in your ears.  

*Dreams are never just about the meeting—they’re about the *horizon* you didn’t see.* 🌌
