The world I awaken to is muffled, as if wrapped in thick wool. Dawn light filters through a small, unevenly glazed window, casting dim patterns on rough-hewn walls that smell of earth, woodsmoke, and something vaguely musty. My clothes – soft cotton, synthetics – are gone, replaced by scratchy, unfamiliar linens and heavy, coarse wollen layers. Silence hangs thick, broken only by distant animal sounds – a rooster crow? – and the rhythmic *thump-thump* of a blacksmith's hammer somewhere nearby. No hum of electricity, no distant traffic roar, no buzzing phone. Just… quiet. Deep, unnerving quiet.

I push myself off a straw-stuffed pallet, the floor cold and uneven beneath bare feet. The room is spartan: a small wooden stool, a clay pitcher on a crude shelf, a heavy iron key hanging beside the door. My heart hammers against my ribs. *Where am I? When am I?*

I stumble outside. The air is crisp, carrying the scent of damp earth, woodsmoke, and unwashed humanity. The street is dirt, churned to mud in places. Structures are timber-framed with wattle-and-daub or stone, thatched roofs sagging under the weight of dew. People move slowly, dressed in similar rough fabrics, hauling water buckets, leading oxen, sharpening tools. No glass windows, no paved roads, no machines. Just muscle, wood, stone, and animal power. The sheer *scale* of it dwarf me. Modern life feels like a distant, impossible dream.

Panic starts to rise, cold and sharp in my chest. My mind races, grasping for the familiar: check my phone, Google the date, call for help. But those anchors are gone, vanished into the ether of time. A profound, terrifying vulnerability washes over me. I know nothing of this place, its rules, its dangers, its people. My knowledge, my skills – typing on a keyboard, navigating databases, understanding complex systems – are utterly useless here. I am an alien, a child stumbling through a world built on foundations I don't comprehend.

As I take a hesitant step down the muddy track, the sun climbing higher, my stomach twists with hunger and thirst. I see a woman drawing water from a well with a wooden bucket and rope. The sheer *effort* required for what I once did with a twist of a faucet hits me like a physical blow. And that’s when the crushing weight of my new reality slams down: **you realize you need to find water, safe water, immediately.** Thirst is a gnawing beast, and in this world, water isn't just from a tap; it's a risk, a chore, a lifeline potentially poisoned by proximity to animals or waste. The cheerful babble of a nearby stream suddenly seems less inviting and more menacing. Survival – the most basic, brutal instinct – has just become my sole, overwhelming focus. The dream of exploring a quaint past curdles into the desperate scramble to simply endure the day.
