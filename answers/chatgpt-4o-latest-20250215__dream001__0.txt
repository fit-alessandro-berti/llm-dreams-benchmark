walk through the neon-lit streets, searching for clues. The buildings stretch impossibly high into the sky, their glass surfaces reflecting a swirling twilight of deep purples and electric blues. Strangers pass by, their faces blurred as if you are seeing them through water.

A soft chime sounds from your pocket. You pull out a sleek, translucent device you don’t remember having. The screen flickers to life, displaying a cryptic message: **"Follow the music."** 

As if on cue, a distant melody drifts through the air—haunting yet familiar. It tugs at something deep within you, pulling you forward. You weave through the streets, past storefronts displaying artifacts that shimmer and shift like mirages. A clock tower in the distance looms over the city, but its hands are spinning too fast to make sense of the time.

You turn a corner and suddenly, the street is empty—silent except for the melody. A single ornate door stands before you, marked with a glowing symbol you recognize but can’t quite place. As you reach for the handle, the door swings open on its own, revealing a grand hall where dozens of people are already seated, waiting.

They all turn to look at you.

"You’re late," a voice says from the front.

You step inside, heart pounding. Something tells you this meeting is more important than anything you've ever done before.

But what happens next?
