feel a rush of adrenaline coursing through your veins. You try to mask your nervousness behind a beaming smile and as your gaze sweeps over the crowd, your eyes meet with familiar faces who are there to support you. Their smiles fill you with confidence.

The microphone is in front of you and you tap it lightly to check if it's on. There's a gentle pop and a hum that echoes through the room, and everyone's eyes are now glued to you. You clear your throat as the harsh spotlight bathes you in a warm radiance that makes your heart pound more than ever. 

In spite of the sweat making your hands slightly tremble, you grip the spotless podium in front of you tightly, mustering the strength to say the first word. "Ladies and Gentlemen," you start, your voice strong and steady.

Then, all of a sudden, you feel a cool breeze as you see the stage's backdrop falling. You realise that the backdrop was actually a green screen displaying a picturesque beach. Now, instead of a serene landscape, you see a wild jungle full of vibrant greens and exotic birdcalls fill the air. 

Your eyes widen in surprise as a clown on a unicycle rolls in from stage left, juggling blazing fire torches in the air. Then, from the right, a parade of elaborately costumed carnival dancers file in, samba music pulsating in the background.

In the midst of this sudden and bewildering spectacle, you keep going. "Thank you all for coming today," you continue. The bizarre circus carries on around you, people in the audience are laughing, some gasp, but they are all captured by your words.

As you deliver your speech, you feel a wave of calm wash over you. Whatever madness surrounds you is out of your control, but the words you speak - they are your own. You look over the jubilant crowd, the circus, the jungle backdrop, and you realize the absurdity of it but you embrace it.

You finish your speech with a flourish, thanking your captive audience for their time. As you step down from the stage amidst a thunderous applause, the previously terrifying prospect of public speaking now seems like an adventure.

The dream concludes with you stepping back into the crowd. You're now smiling broadly, more confident and courageous despite the chaotic dream. It’s as though the unexpected elements had encouraged you, not intimidated you. The applause fades as you wake up, refreshed and ready to face reality.
