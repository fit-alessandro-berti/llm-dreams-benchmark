You wake up in a completely different era, with no modern technology around. As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to survive. The air is crisp, tinged with the earthy scent of moss and woodsmoke, and the sky is a deep indigo streaked with stars. You’re standing in a dense forest, the trees towering like ancient sentinels, their branches weaving a canopy that muffles the sounds of the world below. Your first thought is panic—how did you get here? But panic gives way to curiosity. You’re not alone.  

A distant chime echoes through the trees, and you spot a village nestled in a valley, its thatched roofs glowing with the flicker of firelight. You head toward it, your boots crunching over dry leaves. The villagers, clad in homespun clothes, pause in their work—plowing fields, spinning wool, or tending to livestock. They stare at you, their faces a mix of suspicion and wonder. You stumble into a nearby market, where the air is thick with the smell of fresh bread, herbs, and something sweet—perhaps honey or dried fruit.  

A woman with a weathered face and a basket of eggs approaches you. “You’re not from these parts,” she says, her voice a low rumble. You nod, too stunned to speak. She eyes your clothes—modern fabric, a button-down shirt, and a leather jacket that looks out of place. “The wolves took you, maybe?” she suggests, gesturing to the forest. You shake your head, not sure if she’s mocking you or if she’s seen something similar.  

You stay in the village, learning that it’s 17th-century England, in a time of upheaval. The king is a distant memory, and the people here are embroiled in tensions between old nobility and rising merchants. You’re no longer a stranger, but a curiosity—a “stranger from the woods,” as the villagers call you. Yet your mind races: How did you arrive here? Is this a dream? A test? A message?  

One night, under a sky lit by the Milky Way, you find an old book in the village’s dusty library, its pages brittle but its ink still legible. It speaks of a “Great Sleep” a century before, a time when the world shifted and some were lost to the veil between eras. The text hints at a way home—but it requires a choice: to stay and help rebuild this world or to follow a path that might return you to your own.  

The dilemma haunts you. You could be a savior here, or you could seek answers in the unknown. As dawn breaks, you stand at the edge of the forest, the weight of the decision pressing on your chest. The dream deepens, and the line between reality and imagination begins to blur. What will you choose?
