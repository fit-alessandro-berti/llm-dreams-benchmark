…and the air presses against your skin as if the forest itself is holding its breath. Birds fold their songs. The leaves turn their pale undersides to the sky. A cool scent of iron and pine slips in—ozone, wet bark, something old lifting its head.

Wind moves first, sliding through the ferns, combing the tops of the spruce. It finds you and threads your hair. The path you’ve been following blurs at the edges, swallowed by shadow as clouds knit themselves tight overhead. A drop of rain lands on your wrist—heavy as a coin. Then another on your cheek. Then a dozen, stitching lines between branches, drawing curtains of water that turn the forest into rooms.

You step beneath an arch of birch, where a low-bellied darkness rests like a held note. Thunder speaks from far away, rolling the ground under your boots. The world smells like a match about to strike.

You tell yourself, very calmly, as though giving directions to someone else: You’re dreaming.

The words steady you. The trees hear them. Their trunks are wet and black, their crowns moving like slow water. You could run for shelter, but there is no shelter—only more forest, more wet, more wind. So you do something smaller. You slow down. You set your palm against a broad beech, and its cold skin steadies your pulse. The bark has a scar shaped like an eye. When lightning flickers, the scar shines.

There’s a knot in the trunk, a tight little whirl of wood. You brush it with your thumb. It is warmer than the rest, as if the tree is keeping a secret. Under your touch the knot softens, becomes a circle, becomes—impossibly—a keyhole. Your other hand knows what to do; it has been holding a small brass key you don’t remember finding. The key is light, old, smooth along its edges.

The storm leans closer as you fit metal to wood. Rain intensifies, a drum on the leaves. The key turns with a soft click. The tree opens—not with a door, but with a widening of space, like a breath let out. An interior of green shadow, resin, and a faint light that feels like noon after rain.

Inside is a shelf of ordinary things that seem unmistakably yours: a river stone, a blue thread, a paper boat, a photograph that never existed. On the shelf sits a clear glass jar, lidded, a little fogged from within. It hums, though there is no sound. Your fingers close around it, and you understand without language: this is for weather.

You step back and the tree closes, swallowing the light, becoming only bark and rain again. The wind finds you harder now. Thunder is here, nearby, a deep throat clearing—one, two, three—and the sky lets go.

The downpour is sudden, hard, honest. You hold the jar out into it and unscrew the lid. The rain rushes toward the glass like a flock offered a roost. It slides inside—not all of it, not the forest’s rain, but the storm that had your name written in it, the one pressing down on your ribs, the tightness that arrived without asking. It pours into the jar in a soft spiral, a gray coil like a sleeping animal. The pressure in your chest eases. Your shoulders drop.

You screw the lid back on. The jar is heavy now. Inside, a tiny storm works itself in miniature—lightning like threads of light, thunder like a purr, rain tapping the glass as if to be let out. You tuck the jar beneath your jacket. Warmth returns to you, an ember finding air.

The forest does what forests do. The rain gentles. The wind moves on. The heavy clouds walk themselves away, trailing a skirt of silver. Sun breaks through in bands and lays coin-bright on the path. Every leaf gleams. The smell is green and clean. Somewhere a thrush tries a note and then another, as if checking whether sound is allowed again.

You walk. The ground is springy. Water beads on the moss like tiny lenses. You come to a low place where puddles have gathered, perfect mirrors. In one, you see the sky repairing itself. In another, you see your face, calm and curious.

You crouch there, listening. The jar thumps softly against your ribs like a heartbeat that has learned a slower rhythm. You think: I can open it later, when I’m ready, somewhere wide enough to hold it. A hill, a field. The ocean. Or maybe not at all. The idea of choice feels like shelter.

At the edge of the puddle you notice something glinting—a sliver of color caught in the reed. It is a ribbon, thin and red, the same shade as the thread from the shelf. You tie it around the jar’s neck. It looks right, like a promise made visible.

You stand. The path ahead is bright now, patched with sun. The forest, newly rinsed, feels both familiar and new, like a room you’ve tidied and then remembered you love. On the birch leaves, the last raindrops hold on, round and patient, then let go in their own time.

You breathe, long and simple. You lift your face to the warmed air. The thunder is only a memory now, folded into glass. When you begin walking again, you do it lightly, leaving softer footprints.

Somewhere behind you, a door you can’t see closes with a sound like a quiet click. You don’t turn back. You know where it is if you need it. You are dreaming still, but the kind where you can choose the weather. And for a while you choose this: the hush after rain, the bright smell of earth, the easy weight of a small storm that belongs to you and does not own you.

You keep going. The forest opens, then opens again.
