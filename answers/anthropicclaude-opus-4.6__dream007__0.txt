*I feel the tension thrumming through my body like a live wire. My friend's face is flushed, their words sharp and cutting. My own jaw is tight, my hands clenched at my sides. The words are tumbling out faster now, neither of us really listening—*

I decide to **stop**.

Not storm away. Not fire back. Just... stop.

I take a breath that feels like swallowing broken glass, and I say:

"Wait. Wait. I don't want to win this. I want to understand you."

The silence that follows is almost unbearable. My friend's mouth is still half-open, loaded with the next volley. Their eyes narrow with suspicion—*is this a trick?*

And then the dream shifts, the way dreams do.

The room around us begins to dissolve. The walls peel away like wet paper, and suddenly we're standing in an open field under a sky that's too many colors at once—amber and violet and a deep, impossible green. The wind carries the faint sound of a conversation we had years ago, when things were simpler, when we laughed easily.

My friend looks at me, and their expression softens into something raw and unguarded. I realize I can *feel* what they feel—a deep fear of losing this friendship dressed up as anger.

And I realize mine was too.

"I'm scared of the same thing you are," I say.

They nod. The field around us blooms—wildflowers pushing up through the earth in fast-forward, absurdly beautiful.

We sit down in the grass, and we start the conversation over. Not from the argument. From the thing *beneath* the argument.

And for once, the words come out right.

*The dream holds here—warm, fragile, luminous—like it wants me to remember this feeling when I wake up.*
