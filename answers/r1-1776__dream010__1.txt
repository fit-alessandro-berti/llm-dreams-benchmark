**Dream Continuation:**  

As the competition progresses, you face various challenges and surreal trials that blur the line between reality and imagination. The first task is a labyrinth of shifting hallways filled with riddles whispered by shadows. Your hands tremble as you solve them, each answer dissolving a wall, guiding you closer to the next stage.  

In the second round, you’re paired with a rival—a sharp-tongued genius who undermines your ideas. Together, you must build a machine from scattered parts, but the tools morph into abstract shapes when touched. Frustration mounts until you realize collaboration, not competition, unlocks progress. You compromise, combining their precision with your creativity, and the machine hums to life.  

The final challenge is a stage under a starless sky. The judges—faceless silhouettes—ask you to "present your future." Panic strikes; you have no slides, no script. Then, you inhale deeply and speak from the heart: your passion for the job, your fears of inadequacy, your hunger to grow. As you finish, the air shimmers, and the audience applauds with a thousand echoes.  

Your rival steps forward, revealing they were a test all along—a mirror of your self-doubt. They dissolve into light, leaving a single key on a pedestal. The lead judge steps into the light, offering a handshake. "The job isn’t a prize," they say. "It’s a choice to trust yourself."  

You wake up breathless, the dream’s certainty lingering: *You’re ready*.
