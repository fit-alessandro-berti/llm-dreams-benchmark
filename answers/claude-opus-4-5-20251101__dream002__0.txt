*the air thickens with an electric charge that tastes like copper and old memories*

I feel the storm approaching, but it's not rain that falls—it's **letters**. Thousands of them, tumbling from clouds the color of bruised plums. They stick to my skin and rearrange themselves into words I almost understand.

The trees begin walking alongside me, unhurried, their roots lifting and settling like the legs of ancient elephants. One of them leans close and whispers in a voice like wind through empty rooms: *\ left something here last time.\*

I don't remember a last time.

The path beneath my feet turns to glass, and I can see below it—an entire ocean suspended upside down, fish swimming toward a sky that exists beneath me. I recognize one of the fish. It has my grandmother's eyes.

Lightning strikes, but instead of thunder, there's **music**—a single piano note that stretches into forever.

I realize I'm not walking anymore. I'm standing in a doorway that wasn't there before. On the other side is a room filled with every clock I've ever seen, all showing different times, all somehow correct.

Someone is sitting in a chair with their back to me. They're expecting me.

I reach for the door handle, and it's warm, like a hand reaching back—

*What do I do next?*
