... the air hums with a low, resonant frequency that vibrates in your bones. The canvas is suspended midair, its surface shimmering like liquid mercury, reflecting not your face but fragments of distant galaxies. As you reach out, your shadow on the canvas twists into a spiral of cobalt and gold.  

When your fingers brush the edge, the entire landscape *shifts*. The ground beneath you dissolves into a mosaic of tessellating hexagons, each tile a different hue—screaming red, whispering violet, a green that tastes like rain. The canvas now pulses, as if alive, and you realize it’s not just a surface but a **portal**.  

You dip your hand into a nearby pool of liquid indigo, then drag it across the canvas. A mountain range erupts where your stroke ended: jagged peaks that melt into waterfalls of prismatic light. A shape you didn’t recognize—a fractal bird with wings of shifting geometry—takes flight, leaving trails of binary code in its wake.  

But then the rules fracture. The canvas begins *painting back*. A tendril of silver light slithers from the fabric, wrapping around your wrist. It etches a symbol into your skin: an infinite loop intertwined with a quill. Suddenly, you’re no longer just an observer. The world bends to your thoughts—the trees grow eyes, the sky unravels into a Möbius strip, and every color you name blooms into a new dimension.  

Yet there’s a catch: the dream-world’s boundaries are fragile. If you falter, the canvas might swallow your form, dissolving you into static. You run, now *dancing*, across a bridge of floating polygons, each step triggering a chord in an unseen orchestra. The dream’s logic is a riddle—**what you create must balance what you erase**.  

And somewhere in the chaos, a voice whispers, not in words but in the shape of a question: *Who is the dreamer now?*
