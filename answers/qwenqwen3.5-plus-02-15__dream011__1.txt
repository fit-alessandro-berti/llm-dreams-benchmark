You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are **written in a language you've never seen, yet somehow, you understand them perfectly.**

The ink on the page seems to shimmer, shifting from black to a deep, oceanic blue. Instead of multiple-choice bubbles or essay prompts, the first question simply asks: *"What is the color of your greatest regret?"*

You reach for your pen, but when your fingers touch it, it dissolves into a handful of warm sand that slips through your grasp. A soft hum fills the room, vibrating in your chest. You look up, expecting to see the stern proctor, but the walls of the examination hall have vanished. You are no longer sitting at a desk; you are floating in a vast, starry library where the books are made of light and whisper secrets as they float past you.

A voice, sounding exactly like your own but older and wiser, echoes from the empty space: *"There are no wrong answers here, only paths not yet taken. To pass, you do not need to write; you need to remember."*

Suddenly, the "questions" on the paper begin to transform into scenes from your life—moments you thought you had forgotten, choices you made in a split second, and dreams you abandoned. The exam isn't testing your knowledge of a subject; it's asking you to curate the story of who you are becoming.

You realize with a jolt of clarity that you don't need a pen. You close your eyes, and as you do, the library dissolves into a bright, warm sunrise. You aren't taking an exam anymore; you are waking up, ready to start your career not because you passed a test, but because you finally understand what you truly want to build.

The dream fades, leaving you with a lingering sense of peace and a single, clear thought: *You are already ready.*
