The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **walk away, but not in anger—in silence. You turn and leave the crowded cafe, the chair scraping harshly behind you. The cold air hits your face like a slap.**

You don’t go home. You walk for miles, the city sounds blurring into a single hum. Your mind reels, replaying their words, your words. The hurt isn’t just in what was said, but in the chasm it revealed—a difference in core values you’d never truly faced before.

Night falls. You find yourself on a bridge, staring at the black water below, lit by distant city lights. Your phone buzzes in your pocket. Thirty-seven times. You don’t look.

Then, a text. Not an apology. Not a demand.
*"Remember the lake when we were 15? The one we got lost trying to find? We sat on that log and ate the soggy sandwiches your mom made. We promised we’d always tell each other the truth, even if it hurt."*

Your breath catches. That was before the careers, the relationships, the complicated lives. Before the truth became a weapon.

You don’t text back. Instead, you turn and walk to your car, drive to the old lake, now a murdy retention pond behind a strip mall. The log is gone. But the memory is sharp, painful, and real.

You sit on the damp ground where the log used to be. The anger has burned away, leaving a hollow ache. You finally pull out your phone, thumbs hovering.

You type: *"I’m at the old lake. The log’s gone. But I’m here."*

You hit send. The argument isn’t over. The fundamental disagreement is still there, a stone in both your shoes. But the dream shifts. The cold isn’t just from the night air anymore—it’s the cold clarity of a truth you can’t un-know. The path forward isn’t about winning or losing the argument. It’s about deciding if the friendship is a place where two people can hold that stone together, or if it’s a place where the stone must be thrown.

The dream doesn’t resolve. It holds you in that unbearable, waking moment of choice, the screen glowing in the dark, waiting for the reply that will come when you finally wake up.
