...you encounter various groups of people and realize that everyone is dressed in a single, specific color—yet somehow, the colors aren’t just clothing. They *are* their personality, their mood, their soul.  

The room pulses with light: a sea of crimson lovers whispering secrets in a corner, their laughter streaking the air like sparks. A group in deep indigo sits cross-legged in silence, eyes closed, vibrating with ancient knowledge. Over by the balcony, a swarm of gold threads dances in chaotic joy, spinning stories so bright they cast shadows.  

And then you see *them*—your one acquaintance—standing in a corner, their silhouette a soft, warm beige, like old paper or sunlit dust. They’re holding a small, unlit lantern. You start toward them, but the floor shifts. Suddenly, the floor is made of thin ice, reflecting not your face, but a thousand versions of yourself—each one doing something different: laughing, crying, running, standing still.  

You try to move but your feet are rooted. The beige person sees you, and smiles—not with lips, but with their entire aura. They raise the lantern, and it flares to life, not with fire, but with a voice—*your voice*, but older, wiser.  

*"You were looking for me,"* it says, *"but you were never lost. You were the one who made the color of the room."*  

You wake up with the echo of that lantern-light on your skin, and the strange certainty that you didn’t dream at all…  
…you just forgot how to remember.
