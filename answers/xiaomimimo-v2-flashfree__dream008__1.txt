...feel your legs turn to jelly. The fluorescent lights of the office hum with a malevolent, buzzing intensity, sounding like a swarm of angry bees trapped inside your skull.

You look down at your desk, but instead of your computer, there is a single, giant, ticking clock. The hands are spinning backward. You try to speak to your boss to ask for clarification, but when you open your mouth, only dry autumn leaves spill out, fluttering onto the carpet.

The boss’s face begins to melt slightly, like a candle left in the sun, and they extend an arm that stretches unnaturally across the desk, their hand landing on your shoulder with the weight of a stone statue. "It needs to be done by *yesterday,"* they whisper, but the voice is coming from the telephone, which is now ringing with a sound like screaming teakettles.

Suddenly, the walls of the office peel away like the skin of a fruit, revealing that you are actually sitting at your desk in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The water is perfectly still and glass-like, reflecting a sky that is the color of TV static. A single fish swims by your head, wearing a tiny tie and holding a clipboard. It looks at you, checks a box, and swims away.

You realize you don't have a keyboard, only a handful of wet clay. You have to mold the project out of the clay before the tide comes in, but your hands have turned into oversized lobster claws. You try to type, but you only make clicking noises and scuttle sideways out of the chair, falling into the ocean. You don't sink; you just float there, while the boss, now a giant floating head in the clouds, stares down waiting for the email attachment.
