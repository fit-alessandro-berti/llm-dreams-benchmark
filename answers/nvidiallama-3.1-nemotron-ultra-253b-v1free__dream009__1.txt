...find a way to survive and thrive in this ancient world. The air is crisp and clean, filled with the sounds of hammering on metal, the chatter of people in a language you somehow understand, and the distant lowing of cattle. You look down at yourself and see that you're wearing simple, hand-woven clothing, and your feet are clad in sturdy leather boots. A leather pouch hangs at your side, containing a few coins and a piece of parchment with a cryptic message scrawled on it: "Seek the Artisan's Guild at the Old Oak."

As you make your way through the bustling market square, you notice thethatched roof cottages, the blacksmith's forge emitting a warm glow, and the town well, where people gather to share stories. Your stomach growls, reminding you that you need to find food and shelter. You approach a stall selling fresh bread and roasted meats, and the vendor, an elderly woman with a kind face, greets you warmly.

"Welcome, young traveler," she says. "What brings you to our humble village? You look like you've come from afar. What news do you bring?"

You explain your situation, and the woman's expression turns thoughtful. "You're not the first stranger to appear under mysterious circumstances," she says. "Some say the Old Oak holds the key to unlocking the secrets of this land. But be warned, the journey is fraught with challenges. You'll need all your wits and cunning to succeed."

She hands you a warm loaf of bread and a piece of roasted chicken, refusing payment. "Take this, and may the road rise up to meet you. If you're intent on finding the Artisan's Guild, follow the stream that runs through the village. It will lead you to a clearing, and in the heart of that clearing stands the most magnificent oak you've ever seen."

With a full stomach and a sense of purpose, you set off along the stream, the gentle gurgling of the water accompanying you as you walk. The scenery shifts from thatched cottages to dense foliage, and the air grows thick with the scent of wildflowers and damp earth. After a 20-minute walk, the trees part, revealing a breathtaking sight:

The Old Oak towers above you, its trunk as wide as a house, branches stretching towards the sky like withered fingers. The tree appears to be... glowing. A soft, ethereal light emanates from within its trunk, illuminating a doorway carved into the wood. The doorway is adorned with intricate symbols that seem to shimmer and pulse with a life of their own.

As you approach the doorway, a figure emerges from the shadows. It's a woman with long, silver hair and eyes that sparkle like the stars on a clear night. She regards you with a curious expression, as if sizing you up.

"Ah, a traveler from afar," she says, her voice melodic and soothing. "I have been expecting you. My name is Eira, and I am the guardian of this ancient oak. The Artisan's Guild you seek is not a place, but a group of individuals with extraordinary skills, scattered throughout the land. They possess knowledge and crafts that have been lost to the sands of time."

Eira hands you a small, delicate wooden box. "Solve the riddle inside, and you shall be one step closer to finding the first member of the Guild. But be warned, the riddle is cunning, and the answer may not be what it seems."

You open the box, and inside, you find a small piece of parchment with the following riddle:

"I am always coming but never arrive,
I have a head, but never hair,
I have a bed, but never sleep,
I have a mouth, but never speak.

What am I?"

You ponder the riddle, and after a few moments, a smile spreads across your face as the answer becomes clear. "A river," you say, looking up at Eira. "It's always flowing, or 'coming,' but never actually arrives at a destination. A river has a 'head' or source, a 'bed' or channel, and a 'mouth,' but it doesn't have hair, sleep, or speak."

Eira's face lights up with delight. "Very good, young traveler! Your wit is sharp. As a reward, I shall give you this..." She hands you a small, leather-bound book. "This is a journal belonging to one of the Artisan's Guild members. It contains cryptic clues and sketches that will aid you in your search. May the wisdom of the ages guide you on your journey."

With the journal in hand, you set off towards the next destination, ready to face the challenges and wonders that this ancient world has in store for you. As you walk, the Old Oak's glow fades into the distance, and you can't help but wonder what other secrets and adventures await you on the horizon.
