...look each in the eye and say, “Let’s just breathe.”

The room is colder than usual, the air thick with unspoken words. Your heart races, but instead of lashing out, you take a slow breath and reach across the table, placing your hand on your friend’s. Your voice softens somehow, steady and firm, not angry anymore but resolute.

“Look,” you say, voice barely above a whisper, “this isn’t just about what we disagree on now. It’s about respect. About coming home.”

You pause, then add, “We both care about more than this. What we’re fighting over—our futures, our values, our trust—it’s complicated. But I want to understand you. I want *you* to understand me. Let’s not let this ruin what we’ve built.”

You wait, breath still slow, then nod gently toward them. “Step closer. Let’s stop here. If we can’t agree on everything, maybe we can agree not to let this end the moment.”

The silence hangs, heavy but not hostile. For once, neither of you is snapping. Just two people grown-up enough to say how they feel, and brave enough to listen.

Then, hesitantly, your friend offers their hand first, fingers finding yours. Together, you pull back from the ice, and the argument fades—leaving only the space between you, now lighter.
