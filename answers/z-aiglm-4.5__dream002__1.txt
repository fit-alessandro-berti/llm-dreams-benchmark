The peaceful forest shifts as the sky bruises to an ominous indigo. A sudden, frantic wind whips through the towering pines, stripping needles and sending them swirling like panicked schools of fish. The air grows thick and heavy, pressing in on you, smelling sharply of ozone and damp earth. Distant thunder growls, a deep, guttural warning that vibrates in your bones.

You quicken your pace, the familiar path now feeling treacherous. The first heavy, cold drops of rain splatter onto your face and arms, startlingly large. Then, with a deafening *CRACK* that splits the sky just overhead, lightning forks down, illuminating the forest in a stark, terrifying blue-white flash. For a heartbeat, you see every twisted root, every startled bird mid-flight, the sheer, ancient power of the trees stark against the unnatural light. Thunder follows instantly, a physical blow that shakes the ground and sends your heart hammering against your ribs.

The rain becomes a torrential downpour within seconds, soaking you to the skin, plastering your clothes to your body. You stumble blindly, slipping on slick moss and mud, the wind now a howling beast tearing at the canopy above. Branches groan and snap, falling around you like skeletal arms. You need shelter. Now.

Through the curtain of water and the flickering, jagged light of subsequent strikes, you glimpse a shape ahead – not a natural formation, but a small, sturdy cabin nestled against a rocky outcrop, almost hidden by the storm. Its single, grimy window glows with a warm, inviting amber light. Desperation pulls you forward. You scramble up the slippery rocks, gasping for breath, and reach the aged wooden door. It doesn't seem locked. Without hesitation, you grasp the cold, damp iron handle and push...

The door swings open inward, spilling a rectangle of golden light onto the wet stones. It’s not warmth that hits you first, but silence. The screaming wind and pounding rain vanish instantly, replaced by an unnatural, profound quiet. Inside, a single, flickering candle sits on a rough-hewn table, illuminating a room that feels bigger than the cabin's exterior suggests. Shadows dance on the walls, and you catch the scent of old wood, dust, and something else... something faintly metallic, like pennies left out in the rain. You step over the threshold, dripping onto the worn wooden floorboards, and the heavy door swings shut behind you with a soft, final *click*. The storm's fury is completely gone, leaving only the flickering candlelight and the unsettling quiet of the cabin. You stand there, dripping, Your heart still echoing the thunder Outside, and you realize you are awake. The rain, you realize, is just the sound hitting the roof.
