written in a language you’ve never seen before, filled with strange symbols and swirling patterns that seem to shift as you look at them. Panic sets in as you realize you can’t decipher a single word. The room around you begins to blur, the walls melting into a soft, golden haze. You glance at the other students, but they’re all calmly scribbling away, as if the exam makes perfect sense to them. 
Suddenly, a voice echoes in your mind—not from the room, but from somewhere deep inside you. It whispers, “You already know the answers.” You look down again, and the symbols start to rearrange themselves, forming words you vaguely recognize, then sentences that feel oddly familiar. Your hand moves on its own, filling the page with responses you don’t fully understand but somehow trust are correct. 
The clock ticks faster, the golden haze thickens, and just as you finish the last question, the professor—a figure cloaked in shadow—approaches your desk. They lean in close and say, “This wasn’t the test. The real exam begins now.” The room dissolves entirely, and you find yourself standing on a vast, starry plain, a glowing orb hovering before you, pulsing with possibility. What do you do next?
