You follow their lead, your shoes crunching on cobblestones that seem to shift underfoot, the city’s neon signs flickering in rhythms only you can hear. They lead you to a narrow alley where a bridge of woven light arches over a river of liquid starlight. The strangers gesture toward a door half-hidden behind a waterfall of paper lanterns—each lantern a tiny, glowing face with a name etched in gold. Inside, the air hums with the scent of jasmine and forgotten memories. The room is a library without walls, shelves stretching into constellations, books floating like fireflies. A figure in a cloak of midnight silk offers you a key made of light, whispering, *“Follow the stories that feel like yours.”*  

As you turn the key, the city outside dissolves into a mosaic of your own childhood—your grandmother’s kitchen, a forest where trees hum lullabies, a bridge over a lake that reflects not the sky, but *you*. The strangers melt into the walls, leaving only their laughter echoing in your bones. You walk until you reach a garden where flowers bloom in colors you’ve never seen, their petals whispering secrets in a language that tastes like rain. Suddenly, the ground opens, and you tumble into a cloud of iridescent dust. When you wake, dawn light spills through your window, and the city outside is quiet, ordinary, yet you feel *seen*—as if the strangers’ kindness wasn’t a dream at all, but a map you’ve always carried.
