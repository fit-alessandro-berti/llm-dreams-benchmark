...keep walking toward the distant glow on the horizon. Your worn boots crunch through crystalline sand that shifts between silver and deep purple with each step. The sky above ripples like water, and you realize the \ eye, blinking slowly as it watches your journey.

As you walk, you discover that the backpack you've been carrying contains not supplies, but memories—literally glowing orbs that pulse with warmth. Each one you pull out transforms the wasteland around you: a memory of your grandmother's garden causes wildflowers to bloom through the cracked earth; a memory of laughter with friends makes the toxic rain turn into gentle snow that tastes like cotton candy.

You understand now that you're not just surviving this world—you're healing it, one memory at a time. But the closer you get to that horizon-eye, the heavier the backpack becomes, and you realize you'll have to choose which memories to keep and which to give away to save this strange, broken place.

Behind you, other wanderers begin to follow the trail of beauty you're leaving behind, each carrying their own mysterious burdens...

*The dream shifts and wavers, as dreams do, leaving you with the feeling that something important was almost remembered, almost understood.*
