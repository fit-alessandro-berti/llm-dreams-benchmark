As you examine the box closely, the intricate patterns seem to swirl and shift under your gaze. They are etched in a silvery metal that glimmers with an inner light, and as you trace them with your fingertips, you feel a faint warmth and a subtle vibration, like a silent hum.

The patterns aren't random; they seem to tell a story. You see spirals that look like galaxies, interlocking knots that resemble ancient symbols, and what might be words in a language you've never seen but somehow feel on the verge of understanding.

Driven by curiosity, you press your palm flat against the center of the lid. The hum grows louder, resonating deep in your bones. The patterns begin to glow brighter, the silvery lines burning like molten starlight. The lock doesn't open with a click, but instead, the entire lid dissolves into a shimmering, opaque mist.

Hesitantly, you peer inside. There is no object resting on velvet. Instead, you are looking into a vast, star-filled nebula, a miniature cosmos contained within the box. The mist from the lid swirls around your hand, cool and inviting.

A voice, not heard with your ears but felt in your mind, whispers: *"The key was never meant to be found. It was meant to be remembered."*

You understand. The box wasn't locked to keep you out. It was locked to make you look closely enough to see what was truly inside. Without a second thought, you reach into the starlight.

Your hand closes not around a thing, but around a feeling: a profound sense of peace, a forgotten memory of flying, the exact scent of rain on dry earth from your childhood. The box contained a piece of you, a lost fragment of your own soul you never knew was missing.

As you withdraw your hand, the nebula fades, the mist solidifies back into the lid, and the patterns return to their dormant state. The box is now just a box. But you are different. You feel whole, complete in a way you haven't felt in years. You know the dream will end soon, but you also know you'll carry this feeling back with you into the waking world.
