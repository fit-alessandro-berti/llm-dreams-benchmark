# The Dream Continues...

...build something that brings people together.

You realize the crumbling library on the hill has survived mostly intact. Over weeks, you gather others—drawn by quiet word-of-mouth—and together you clear the rubble, patch the roof, organize the books.

It becomes something unexpected. Not just a library, but a meeting place. Someone brings rationed coffee and you share it in the mornings. A woman teaches others to read. A man repairs things in the corner. Children draw pictures on salvaged paper.

You notice something strange happening: people start taking more care with each other. They share not out of obligation, but because they've begun to hope again.

One evening, as dust motes dance in the fading light through the broken windows, a child asks you, \d you choose to fix this place instead of just surviving?\

You open your mouth to answer, but the dream begins to dissolve...

*What would you have said to the child? Does the dream shift here, or does it fade entirely?*
