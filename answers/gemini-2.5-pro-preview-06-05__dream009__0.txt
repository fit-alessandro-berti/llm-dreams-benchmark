...find the source of a sound that doesn't belong.

It’s not a loud sound. In fact, it’s so quiet I barely notice it at first. The world around me is a tapestry of ancient noises: the clatter of wooden cart wheels on cobblestone, the distant bleating of goats, the murmur of a language that sounds like liquid silver and stone. I’m standing in a sun-drenched plaza, surrounded by buildings of white-washed clay and dark timber. People in simple, earth-toned tunics and leather sandals flow around me like a river, their faces weathered and curious as they glance at my strange, soft clothing.

But beneath it all, there it is. A faint, high-frequency hum. The kind of sound a television makes when it’s been left on a blank channel, or the electronic whine of a fluorescent light. It’s a sound of my time, a ghost of electricity in an age of fire and iron.

No one else seems to hear it. A woman selling pomegranates from a large basket argues good-naturedly with a customer. A group of children chase a hoop down a narrow alley, their laughter sharp and clear. I press my hands to my ears, and the hum intensifies, as if it’s coming from inside my own head.

I realize I need to follow it. It’s the only thread connecting me to the world I lost, but it also feels profoundly wrong, like a dissonant note in a perfect symphony.

I walk, leaving the plaza behind. The hum grows stronger as I navigate the winding, labyrinthine streets. It leads me away from the bustling center of the town, towards a quieter, more overgrown district where ivy clings to crumbling walls and the air smells of damp earth and forgotten things.

The sound leads me to a small, unassuming stone building with a heavy oak door. There are no windows. The hum is strongest here, a nervous vibration I can feel in the soles of my feet. I push the door. It groans open into a dusty, dimly lit room.

The space is a workshop. Not for a blacksmith or a potter, but for something finer. Intricate tools I don’t recognize are laid out on wooden benches. Half-finished wooden gears and delicate brass filaments litter the floor. In the center of the room, on a pedestal, is the source of the sound.

It’s an orrery. A magnificent, complex model of the solar system, crafted from brass and silver. But it’s not our solar system. Moons of jade and obsidian orbit a sun of hammered gold. The planets spin on their elegant arms, but they move jerkily, unnaturally, and from the very center of the golden sun pulses the low, electronic hum. It’s a sound of wrongness, of a system breaking down.

An old man I hadn't noticed before steps out from the shadows. His eyes are cloudy, but they seem to see me with perfect clarity. He doesn't speak my language, but I understand him anyway, the way you do in dreams.

*It is broken,* he communicates, not with words, but with a feeling of deep, weary sorrow. *A splinter from another time has pierced the heart of the clockwork. The sky is beginning to forget its steps.*

He gestures to the orrery, then to me. I understand. The splinter is me. My presence, my memory of a different world, is the hum. I am the ghost in this machine.

I realize what I need to do. It isn't to find a way back. It's to fix this.

I reach out, my hand trembling, and place it on the golden sun. It’s cool to the touch. I close my eyes and I don't try to push my world away, I try to… harmonize it. I think of the sound of a city, of cars and sirens and electricity, but I picture it as a river, flowing around this delicate mechanism instead of through it. I think of the stars as I know them, not as a replacement, but as a sister-pattern, a different verse to the same song.

The harsh hum softens. It shifts in pitch, lowering until it becomes a deep, resonant chord, like a cello. The jerky planets on the orrery smooth out, their dance becoming fluid and graceful once more. The sound of wrongness is gone, replaced by a quiet, perfect music of spheres.

The old man nods, a single, grateful gesture.

I take my hand away. The air in the room is clean now, silent except for the whisper-soft whir of the cosmos turning as it should. I look at my hands, my clothes. They seem more solid, more real. But when I look towards the door, the sunlight streaming in feels different, warmer. I no longer feel like a ghost. I feel like I'm part of this place.

And I have no idea how to get home. But for the first time since I woke up, I’m not scared. The dream is not a nightmare anymore. It's just… a new place to be.
