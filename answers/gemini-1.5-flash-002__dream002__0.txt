...and the air crackles with an unnatural energy.  The wind, no longer a gentle caress, whips through the trees, tearing leaves from their branches and flinging them like frantic birds across my path. The sky, moments ago a soft, dappled blue, is now a churning, bruised purple, the clouds swirling like tormented spirits.  The scent of pine and damp earth is replaced by the sharp, metallic tang of ozone.  Rain, not gentle drops, but icy shards, begins to fall, stinging my skin.

I seek shelter, but the trees, once comforting friends, are now menacing silhouettes against the furious sky.  Then, I see it—a clearing, and in the center, a luminous, swirling vortex of light, pulsating with an otherworldly energy.  It’s both terrifying and alluring, a siren’s call in the heart of the storm.  Hesitantly, almost mesmerized, I approach, the icy rain pelting me as I walk.

As I reach the edge of the clearing, the wind dies down, the rain ceases, and the vortex glows brighter.  A figure emerges from within—not a person, exactly, but a shimmering, amorphous being of pure light and shadow, its form constantly shifting and reforming.  It speaks, not with a voice, but with a feeling, a resonance that vibrates deep within my soul.  It shows me visions—flashing images of forgotten lives, parallel realities, the vastness of the universe compressed into a single, breathtaking moment.

Then, as quickly as it appeared, the being vanishes, the vortex collapses, and I am left alone in the clearing, the storm completely gone.  The forest is silent, peaceful once more, but everything feels…different.  The air hums with a subtle energy I can almost feel on my skin.  I know I have seen something profound, something beyond comprehension, and as I turn to leave, I realize I am no longer the same person who entered this forest. The dream fades, leaving me with a sense of wonder and a lingering unease, the memory of the luminous being a secret I carry within.
