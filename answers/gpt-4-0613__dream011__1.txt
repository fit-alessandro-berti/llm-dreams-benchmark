all written in an alien language you have never seen before. The characters are distinctly non-human, featuring intricate symbols, dots, and lines forming an enigmatic script. Panic rises in your chest as you flip through page after page of the incomprehensible text.

Suddenly, a question catches your eye because it looks different. There, highlighted by an iridescent glow, a question is somehow written in English. "To understand, you must first forget," it reads cryptically. Intrigued and bewildered, you close your eyes, attempting to clear your mind, forgetting the impending test and the worries that surrounded it.

As soon as you open your eyes, the pages, once overflowing with alien symbols, are now filled with English words. The questions are incredibly complex, requiring deep thought and understanding, and yet you find yourself answering them all with an ease that astounds you. Every formula and every concept seems to flow effortlessly from your fingertips, as though your brain retrieves from a timeless repository of knowledge.

A sense of joy bubbles within, replacing the mounting stress. It's not just the thrill of comprehension but also the feeling of unlocking a part of yourself you didn't know existed. The words you write on the paper seem full of wisdom, unraveling years of accumulated knowledge before your very eyes.

The once intimidating, alien language now feels instinctual; a part of your being. You start making connections, linking theories and concepts that form a whole. Beam of light illuminates the room, emanating from the paper, wrapping you in a warm blanket of understanding.

Just as you compose the final answer, you wake up. Despite the dream being over, the feelings of joy and accomplishment are still vivid. The mundane everyday world seems rather surreal now in comparison to the discovery of your hidden intellectual prowess. As you sit up and start your day, you can't help but feel a sense of determined optimism towards the upcoming exam.
