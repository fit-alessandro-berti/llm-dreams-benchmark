... feel a tremor run down my spine. My palms were slick with sweat, despite the polished, oak podium I was gripping. A sea of faces, a thousand eyes or more, stared up at me. 

My heart, a frantic hummingbird in my chest, began a drum solo against my ribs.  I froze, the hush of the expectant crowd a thousand times louder than the drumming.

My knees felt weak, but I knew I had to continue. This was for them, for the forgotten voices, for the dreams I was about to share.  

"begin to..."

*breathe.*

I took a deep breath, my lungs expanding like sailboats on full wind, trying to quell the storm raging inside.

"...begin to feel a warmth spread through me," I stammered, my voice cracking as I looked at the crowd.

The spotlight felt even more intense now that my legs had finally stopped feeling like rubber. But it wasn't the heat of the lights that warmed me, it was the faces before me. I realized I wasn't on a polished stage, but in a dimly lit, smoky bar, the kind with sticky wooden floors and deflated balloons limply clinging to the ceiling.

Instead of the thousands I had imagined, the crowd was perhaps a hundred strong,  a motley crew crammed onto wobbly stools and cluttered tables. From my vantage point behind the sticky, crammed-with-papers podium – which had “Free Fries” scrawled across its side in faded marker – I could make out the distinct aroma of yesterday's beer and a nervous tension in the hushed room.

My trembling didn't subside. My mouth felt dry, the words caught in my throat, a hummingbird buzzing furiously against a desert wind. But they were growing bolder, telling me to lean into the discomfort, to embrace the hundreds of questioning, anticipating gazes.

..."anticipate,” I said, forcing my voice to steady,  “that I, your humble…”

I trailed off, remembering the nervous tremor I had been experiencing.

..."me to stand here and—"

A distraction! A woman in a crimson dress at the front of the crowd – a young woman, her face familiar even through the fog of a thousand anxieties – hushing a little boy who was pulling at her skirt. The excitement, the terror, snagged on a thought. My name. “Don’t start anticipating the speech, mom’s getting hungry before the play even begins!” she was saying, exasperated, like reciting a line from a play script everyone found corny.

My gaze swept across the crowd, taking in their annoyance, clearly manifested in the sputtering requests for the boy to “be quiet” and let them “enjoy the performances, we’ve paid good money for 'em (and the pickle slices on my plate)!” This woman... this was Anna, the woman I’d seen on the “missing persons” posters plastered around town. Her flyer was crumpled in her purse, but she clutched it like a lifeline. My heart skipped a beat.

This dream felt different. This doubt, this anxiety...

..."that I'm not going to be able to do it."

* * *

The heavy bar crowd fell silent as I nervously cleared my throat, the faded hanging balloons like a silent commentary on my lackluster performance in this, my own, “Free Fries!”*  I sputtered, “The... the research team...“ 

The project, the one I thought I had so much time for, awaited me.

*“Free Fries” course.

My throat tightened. 

This nervous welcome.* I could imagine them, then thousands of pairs of eyes began to scrutinize me from behind their beer mugs.

The critical gaze of the crowd, punctuated by confused murmurs.


My hands fumbled with the microphone. My years ofPirating an increasingly dense and uncomfortable silence.

“sorry, for the… the sudden delay," I stammer, catching the heckling ‘be quiet, our research depends on it!’ from a voice that carried a faint scent of vinegar.

"Now...uh..listen, maybe this isn't where I'm supposed to be. 

* .......
