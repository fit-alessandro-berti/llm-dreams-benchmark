...are not questions about the course material, but deeply personal, utterly nonsensical, and impossibly abstract queries.

Question 1 asks: "Describe the structural integrity of a forgotten promise using only silence."

Question 2 reads: "Calculate the emotional weight of a raindrop landing on pavement before it evaporates, expressing your answer in units of 'regret per sigh'."

Question 3 is a diagram: a complex, shifting maze labeled "The Path Not Taken," with the instruction: "Navigate this maze backwards through time to find the scent of your earliest childhood memory."

A wave of cold panic washes over me, different from exam nerves. This is the panic of fundamental misunderstanding, of the ground giving way. My pen feels heavy, alien in my hand. The ink on the page seems to shimmer slightly, the words rearranging themselves if I look away for too long, becoming less like letters and more like swirling patterns or tiny, skittering insects.

The room feels too quiet, too large. The faces of the other students are blurred, indistinct. The clock on the wall is running backward, or perhaps it's not a clock at all, but a giant, sad-looking potato with numbers carved into it.

I try to focus, to find *some* logic, but the questions pull me down into their absurdity. How can you describe silence? How do you quantify emotion? How do you navigate time with a pencil and a dream logic maze?

The weight of my future feels crushing, but the exam offers no way to lift it. The paper starts to feel strangely warm beneath my fingers, like living skin, and the questions begin to pulse softly... pulse with the rhythm of my own terrified heartbeat. The ink runs together, blurring the impossible words into a single, swirling vortex, and I feel myself being drawn into the page, the lines of the maze becoming walls, the abstract questions becoming the only reality...
