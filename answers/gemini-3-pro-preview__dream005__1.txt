...the architecture of the room begins to behave like a liquid. The ceiling drifts upward until it becomes a twilight sky filled with paper lanterns, and the floor feels soft, like deep moss under my dress shoes.

I push past a cluster of people wearing tuxedos, but as I brush against them, I realize they are two-dimensional cardboard cutouts. They are discussing the flavor of the color blue in hushed, static-filled whispers. One of them hands me a glass of champagne, but when I look closer, the bubbles are tiny, trapped fireflies buzzing against the crystal.

"Have you seen him?" I ask, but my voice comes out as a melody played on a cello, low and vibrating in my chest.

I spot the person I know—Sam—standing near a fountain that is erupting with sand instead of water. He is wearing the same jacket he wore in high school. I try to run toward him, but the air has turned into clear molasses. Every step takes years.

I stumble into another group. These people are faceless, their heads replaced by floating geometric shapes—cubes, pyramids, spheres—that glow with a soft, neon pulse. They are playing a card game, but the cards are photographs of my childhood. They deal a hand: me learning to ride a bike, me scraping my knee, me blowing out candles. The Pyramid-head plays the 'Bike' card, and suddenly I can smell fresh cut grass and rusted metal.

"Sam!" I try to shout again. This time, a flock of white moths flies out of my mouth.

Sam turns around. For a second, relief washes over me. But as he smiles, his features begin to rearrange. His eyes drift apart, his mouth unzips, and he dissolves into a swarm of blue ribbons that float up toward the paper lanterns.

The party guests applaud, but the sound is indistinguishable from the sound of rain hitting a tin roof. I look down at my hand; I am holding one of the blue ribbons. It reads, in gold lettering: *“Wake up.”*
