…run, but the streets shift beneath your feet like sliding puzzle pieces. Skyscrapers glide apart, revealing new boulevards that didn’t exist a second ago. You spot a glowing clock tower ahead—its hands already at 11:05—and decide that must be the place.

As you weave through a crowd of faceless commuters, a silver streetcar pulls up beside you. Its conductor, an owl in a crisp navy uniform, tips his cap.  
“Next stop: Where You’re Supposed to Be,” he hoots.

You hop aboard. The car travels not along rails, but across reflections—skimming the mirrored surfaces of office windows, lake water, even polished shoes. Outside, billboards flash personalized messages:  

“Don’t be late!”  
“Turn left at the cloud shaped like a key!”  
“Trust the third door.”

The owl drops you at a marble plaza. Three doors stand in a row, each marked only by a different scent drifting from within: cinnamon, ocean spray, and new‑cut grass. Remembering the billboard, you step through the third door.

Instantly you’re in a sunlit atrium filled with floating paper maps. One unfolds in your hands, its ink rearranging into a clear route: up the spiral staircase, across the glass bridge, down the elevator that travels sideways.

Following the path, you arrive at a quiet conference room with a single chair. Seated in it—awaiting you—is yourself, dressed as you were ten years ago. Past‑You smiles and says, “Relax. The meeting was just to remind you that you already know the way.”

The walls dissolve into soft morning light. An alarm rings in the distance, and you wake with the lingering taste of cinnamon and the certainty that, whatever today brings, you won’t be lost.
