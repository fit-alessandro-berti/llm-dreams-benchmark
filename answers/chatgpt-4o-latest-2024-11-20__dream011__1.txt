written in a language you don't understand. The characters swirl and shift on the page, refusing to stay still. Panic wells up inside you, but you force yourself to take a deep breath. Looking around, you realize that your classmates appear calm, diligently working on their exams. In fact, they seem eerily calm—too calm. It's as though they’re statues, frozen in time.

The exam booklet glows faintly, as if alive. Suddenly, one question emerges from the swirling text, clear as day: **"What is the one thing that matters most to you?"** The classroom begins to waver and distort, the walls melting into a vast, infinite void. You feel strange, as though the question is not asking for an answer from your mind, but from your very essence.

Before you can respond, the booklet folds itself into a paper crane and takes flight, soaring toward the void. Without thinking, you rise and chase after it. As you leap into the abyss, the glowing paper crane bursts into a kaleidoscope of light, scattering shards of memories. Somehow, these fragments are your memories—but they’re not quite how you remember them. Familiar faces appear amid the shards, asking questions of their own, questions that pierce straight into your soul.

One memory shard flashes brighter than the others. You reach for it, and suddenly you’re standing in a field under a sunset sky. In the distance, a figure waits for you, holding the exam booklet. As you approach, the figure turns, and it’s… **you.** But it’s not quite you—it’s a version of you that exudes confidence, peace, and clarity.

The other-you smiles and hands you the booklet. Inside, the swirling words finally make sense. They tell you that the exam has never been about answering a set of predefined questions. Instead, it’s about understanding that the questions themselves are a reflection of *who you are becoming.*

The glowing booklet dissolves in your hands, and the other-you whispers, "The choice is yours." You wake up with a jolt, the dream fading but leaving you with an unshakable feeling of wonder—and a quiet certainty about the path you must take.

What do you do next?
