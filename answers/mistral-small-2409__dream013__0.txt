feel the puzzles becoming increasingly challenging, as if the maze itself is testing your limits. The walls are made of intricate marble patterns that seem to shift and change with each step you take. You can hear distant whispers that sound like riddles, but you can't quite make out the words.

Suddenly, you come across a large, ornate door. It's locked, and above it, there's a plaque with a riddle inscribed:

*I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?*

You ponder the riddle, letting your dream-logic take over. After a moment, the answer strikes you: "It's the wind itself!" You say the answer aloud, and the door creaks open, revealing a dimly lit corridor.

As you step through the doorway, the whispers become clearer. They're repeating a phrase, over and over: "Find the heart of the maze, and you shall wake." Intrigued, you decide to press on, determined to find the heart of the maze and wake from this dream.

The corridor leads you to a vast chamber filled with more puzzles. In the center stands a large, stone pedestal with a glowing orb resting on top. It pulses with a rhythm that seems to match your heartbeat. You approach the pedestal, and the orb begins to project images around the chamber—scenes from your past, your present, and even glimpses of what might be your future.

You reach out to touch the orb, and it hums softly, responding to your touch. The images flicker and change, focusing on a single scene: a lush garden filled with vibrant flowers and a clear, bubbling stream. In the center of the garden, there's a tree with a heart-shaped marking on its trunk. The voice from the whispers echoes in your mind, "Find the heart of the maze..."

With newfound determination, you close your eyes and focus on the heart-shaped marking. When you open your eyes, you're standing in the garden from the vision. The heart tree is right in front of you, and beneath it lies a small, intricately designed box.

You open the box, and inside, you find a single, shimmering feather. As you pick it up, the dream begins to fade, and you're left with the sensation of falling. You grip the feather tightly, and when you open your eyes, you're back in your bed, the feather still clutched in your hand. You look around, the room aglow with the first light of dawn, and you know—you've woken from the maze.
