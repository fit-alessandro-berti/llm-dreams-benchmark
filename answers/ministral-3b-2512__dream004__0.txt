Ah, the blank canvas—an endless, shifting void where the rules of perception dissolve like sugar in water. The air hums with the ghostly whispers of colors that haven’t quite settled into place yet, their edges flickering like candle flames in a hurricane. The ground beneath you is a living, breathing thing: sometimes solid stone, sometimes a shifting mesh of liquid silver, sometimes nothing at all—just the weight of your breath pressing into the air like a question mark.

You step forward, and the canvas *pulses*. Not with light, but with *potential*. It’s not blank—it’s *alive*, a vast, undulating surface where every square holds a whisper of what could be. A finger of violet stretches from the horizon, curling like a question mark. A spiral of gold unfurls from the horizon, as if someone had taken a compass and spun it into existence. The edges blur, then sharpen, then blur again—like a dream waking into itself.

A voice, neither yours nor anyone else’s, murmurs from the void: *"What do you see?"*

You reach out, and your hand passes through the canvas like smoke. The colors *react*—some darken, some brighten, some split into spectra that bleed into each other. A single drop of indigo falls from your fingertips, and it doesn’t just stain the canvas; it *unfolds* into a tiny galaxy, a constellation of stars that flicker and die before reforming into a smile. The smile is yours.

Then, the canvas *speaks*. Not with words, but with *images*—a memory of a child’s laughter, a sunset that wasn’t real, a door that wasn’t there before. It’s offering you a choice: to *fill* it, or to *become* it. To press your palm against it and let the colors seep into your skin, your bones, your very being. To dissolve into the shifting, breathing thing beneath your feet.

But as you hesitate, the canvas *changes again*. The violet finger twists into a scream. The gold spiral unravels into a screaming. The horizon splits—one half is a desert of black glass, the other a forest of screaming trees. The voice is gone. Only the whisper remains: *"You are the blank. Now what?"*

And then—you wake.

*(Or do you?)*
