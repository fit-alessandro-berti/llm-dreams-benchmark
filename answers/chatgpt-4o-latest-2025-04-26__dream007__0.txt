...and you decide to step outside to cool down. The air is thick and buzzing, not with insects, but with a strange golden shimmer, like sunlight tangled in mist.

Your friend follows you out, still upset, but the world around you both begins to change. The street you were standing on ripples like water, folding into a vast meadow filled with enormous, luminous flowers. Each flower pulses gently, almost as if breathing.

You and your friend stare at each other, the argument now feeling small and distant. The petals of a nearby flower unfurl, revealing a spiral staircase made of glass leading down into the earth.

Without speaking, you both know you have to go down together. Whatever was between you needs to be faced at a deeper level.

You glance at your friend, who gives a small, reluctant nod. Together, you step onto the first glass stair, and the dream pulls you deeper into its shimmering heart.

Would you like me to keep going? ðŸŒ™
