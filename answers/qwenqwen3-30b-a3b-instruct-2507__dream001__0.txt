You start to panic, the city stretching endlessly in every direction—skyline punctuated by impossible towers that seem to breathe, their surfaces shifting like living skin. Neon rivers pulse along the ground, not from signs, but from the pavement itself, glowing faintly beneath your feet as you dash forward.

You spot a floating taxi, its silhouette resembling a teardrop made of chrome and mist, drifting just above the street. It hesitates, then hovers down, the door opening with a soft *whoosh*. Inside, a driver with eyes like polished obsidian smiles, silent but knowing.

"I need to get to the Chamber of Echoing Names," you say, voice tight with urgency. "It's just past the Clockwork Arch, I think?"

The driver doesn’t react. Instead, the city *whispers* around you—voices in every language, half-remembered lullabies, fragments of old promises. One voice, clear and familiar, calls your name—your mother’s, but not quite. You turn, but see no one.

The taxi glides forward, weaving through alleyways that weren’t there a moment ago. Buildings fold like paper, revealing hidden courtyards with fountains that pour liquid starlight. A clock tower looms ahead, its hands spinning backward. The numbers flicker: *58… 57… 56…*

You clutch your chest. *Fifty-six minutes.* The meeting isn't just important—it’s *your* meeting. The one where you’re supposed to remember something critical. Something you lost. Something you *are*.

The taxi slows at the edge of a bridge made of stacked memories—shattered mirrors reflecting faces you don’t recognize but feel deep in your bones. You step out.

On the other side, the Chamber of Echoing Names stands—simple, quiet, ancient. A door carved with your name, in a language you’ve never seen, yet understand instinctively.

You press your hand to the wood. It hums. A voice, soft and infinite, says: *"You’ve been here before. You’re just late."*

And then you remember—not who you are, not where you’re supposed to go—but *why* you’re here.  

You’ve been waiting for this moment your entire life.  

And so, breath shallow, you open the door.
