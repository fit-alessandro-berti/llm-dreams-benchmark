…walk, then realize walking will take too long, so you will the pavement itself to move. The cobblestones ripple like a conveyor belt, carrying you forward while the skyline rearranges itself—towers bending like reeds, neon kanji dissolving into Arabic calligraphy, windows blinking like eyes that watch you glide past.

A street sweeper made of origami cranes flutters by. You ask it for directions. It pauses, refolds itself into a paper compass, and points north. “Follow the music,” it whispers, though it has no mouth. You pocket the compass; it beats like a miniature heart against your palm.

You hurry, but the hour hand on your watch coils into a snake, hisses, and bites its own tail. Time loops. You’re still late.

Panic rises, so the city senses it and shifts again. Buildings sink into cobblestone tide pools, replaced by a hedge maze of glass walls. Every wall reflects a different version of you: one in a business suit, another in childhood pajamas, another with silver hair and astronaut gloves. Each reflection mouths the same word: “Breathe.”

You obey. The maze melts, replaced by a train platform that hovers in mid-air. An old, chrome locomotive arrives, its cars labeled “Possibility,” “Regret,” and “Next.” You board “Next.” Inside, the seats are occupied by people wearing blank masks. They hand you a ticket with a single address: “Room 713, Summit Tower, 53rd & Tomorrow.”

The train door vanishes before you can ask which stop is Tomorrow. The origami compass flutters, then dives onto the floor and unfurls into a street map made of newspaper headlines that haven’t been printed yet. You trace your finger to 53rd & Tomorrow; the ink smears into a river.

Suddenly you’re standing on a small boat drifting down that ink-black river. Lanterns float overhead like fireflies with ambitions. A ferryman in a three-piece suit—his face a revolving clock—rows you along. “Important meeting, is it?” his voice echoes inside your skull. You nod.

He hands you a business card: “Meeting with Yourself, Summit Tower, 7th Floor, Look Up.” You look up. The sky peels away like wallpaper, revealing a colossal glass tower suspended upside-down. Its revolving door is level with the prow of your boat.

You step through. Gravity flips; you’re right-side-up inside an atrium filled with elevator shafts that spiral like DNA. One elevator opens: the interior is an office cubicle lit by sunrise. On the desk lies a single folder labeled “Outcome.” You open it to find a mirror.

Your reflection ages and de-ages, cycling through every year you’ve lived and some you haven’t. Finally it stabilizes as the present you, eyes meeting eyes. The mirror ripples, and your reflection speaks: “The meeting was never about where—only about when you’d be ready to see who’s waiting.”

You step through the mirror into a quiet boardroom where every chair is empty except one—yours. A clock on the wall reads exactly the moment you left home. The second hand clicks once, freezes, and lets out a soft chime.

You sit, realizing the agenda is blank, meaning you get to write it. A pen appears in your hand, already uncapped.

As you touch ink to paper, the city outside sighs in relief, and you wake—still holding the invisible shape of that pen, already drafting the next day of your life.
