...hide the fact that you are from the future and learn to survive by their rules, immediately.

You stand on a cobbled street slick with morning dew, surrounded by timber-framed buildings that lean precariously over the narrow path. The air is thick with the smell of woodsmoke, unwashed bodies, and roasting chestnuts. People in heavy wool tunics and leather aprons bustle past, shooting you wary looks—likely wondering why your clothes are so brightly colored and your hands are so soft.

Instinctively, you pat your pocket for your phone, a reflex hardwired into your brain, but your fingers only brush against rough denim. A chill runs down your spine that has nothing to do with the crisp morning air. You realize that your knowledge of the internet, of modern history, or of engineering is useless here if you can't speak their dialect or understand their customs.

A watchman in a helmet eyes you suspiciously from the corner, his hand resting on the pommel of a sword. You realize you need to **blend in, and fast**. You pull up your hood, duck your head, and slip into the flow of the crowd, praying you can figure out how to buy bread without getting arrested for witchcraft before the sun goes down.
