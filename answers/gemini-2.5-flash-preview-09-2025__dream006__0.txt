...begin to speak.

I clear my throat, adjust the microphone stand—it feels strangely flexible, like carved soap—and lean in. The expectant silence of the thousands of faces below is a physical pressure against my chest. This is the moment. I have the perfect opening line, the one that hooks them instantly.

I open my mouth, intending to deliver the first powerful, resonant word: **“Friends…”**

But the sound that comes out is not my voice.

It is the bright, insistent, and utterly distinct **“Mee-Oww!”** of a very angry Siamese cat, amplified into a deafening roar by the stadium speakers.

A collective shiver goes through the audience. They do not laugh; they simply pause, their expressions frozen in a state of courteous, highly confused interest.

Panic claws at my throat. I try again, forcing my vocal cords to cooperate. This time, I strain for the word **“Today…”**

What leaves my mouth is the high-pitched, rhythmic **“clack-clack-clack”** of a distant sewing machine, followed by the lonely, mournful sound of a winter wind whistling through a broken pane of glass.

My hands start to shake. I look down, and realize my notes are no longer neatly typed bullet points, but hundreds of shimmering, translucent blue monarch butterfly wings, fluttering softly in my grip. As I try to grab hold of them, they scatter, raining down onto the front rows like slow, silent snow.

The audience, though, is still waiting patiently. They haven't moved. And as I stare at them, I notice the faces are starting to change. They are losing definition—the eyes becoming larger, deeper, pooling into black voids, and the contours of their clothes dissolving into smooth, polished stone.

The stage lights, which were once warm spots, now retract and dim, revealing that the great hall is not a hall at all. It is the hollow space beneath the root system of an impossibly large, ancient tree. I am standing on the curve of one massive, sleeping root, and the audience below me is made up not of people, but of thousands of perfectly round, grey river stones, stacked in concentric rings.

They are all looking at me. And though they are stones, I know they are still waiting for me to finish my speech.

I manage one last effort, trying to explain the situation, to apologize for the cat sound, for the impossible butterflies.

I inhale deeply. And I exhale a long, beautiful, perfectly clear bubble, the size of a watermelon, which floats out over the silent stone crowd and gently pops, leaving the faint, sharp smell of ozone and rain.

Then, I close my eyes, knowing that my only remaining choice is to become silent, too, and let the dream dissolve the stage and the speech entirely. I stand perfectly still, and the world begins to turn into the deep, soft texture of moss.
