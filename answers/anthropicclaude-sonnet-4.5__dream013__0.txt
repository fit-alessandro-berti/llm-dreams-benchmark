feel the walls beginning to breathe around you. The puzzles start shifting—what was once a mathematical equation melts into a riddle written in your grandmother's handwriting, though the words keep rearranging themselves before you can finish reading.

You solve one puzzle, and the doorway that opens reveals not another corridor, but a room from your childhood home, except the proportions are all wrong. The ceiling is too high, or maybe you're too small. The next puzzle appears on the wallpaper itself, patterns forming and reforming into logic gates that you somehow understand intuitively.

As you move deeper, you realize you're no longer walking—you're gliding, or perhaps the maze is moving around you. The puzzles become increasingly abstract: arrange these feelings in order of intensity, calculate the color of nostalgia, find the pattern in a sequence of memories you can't quite recall having.

Other people appear sometimes, fellow maze-walkers, but when you try to speak to them about the solutions, your voice comes out as numbers, and their responses are emotions you can feel but not hear. 

The deeper you go, the more you suspect that solving the puzzles isn't helping you escape—it's building something. Each solution adds a room, a corridor, a possibility. You're not finding your way out of the maze.

You're becoming it.
