you feel, with the certainty dreams have, that it has been waiting for you.

When you touch it, your fingers sink in as if through the surface of a pond. The canvas ripples; the whole sky ripples with it. Colorless at first—like breath on glass—then slowly suffused with a low, luminous glow: a dawn that forgot to choose a color.

Your hand comes back dusted in something that isn’t quite paint and isn’t quite light. It hums softly against your skin, rearranging your fingerprints into tiny spirals, constellations, unreadable alphabets. When you blink, those same symbols flicker dormant behind your eyelids.

Instinct, not memory, guides you. You raise your hand and begin to paint, or write, or unseal.

There is no brush. Your gestures are enough.

- With one slow arc, a horizon appears. It doesn’t decide whether it’s land or sea, so it becomes both—in one direction: sand that sifts upward, forming dunes that float like clouds; in the other: water that tumbles downward, forming waterfalls that fall into the sky.
- A second motion: a sun blossoms, then splits; half of it chooses to be moon, soft and blue, the other half filters into a thousand small, drifting seeds of gold. They scatter, take root in the air, and grow into lanterns. Each lantern contains a memory you have not yet made.
- A third motion: you trace a doorway in the center of the canvas. The outline shivers, then deepens, becoming a real door standing freestanding in the shifting dust. It is made of overlapping transparencies: doors you have opened, doors you never found the courage to touch, doors that only existed in the corner of your eye when you were sad and thought you were alone.

Something nudges at you: step through.

Behind you, shapes reconfigure themselves into hesitant companions—fractals that look almost like hands reaching out, origami birds unfolding and refolding midair, a tall narrow shadow that wears your posture but not your face. They are patient. They will follow if you ask, stay if you don’t.

You grasp the door’s handle. It’s warm, like skin that has just let go of someone else’s hand.

On the other side of the door is not another place, but the underside of the canvas you’ve just drawn upon. You see the world you created as veins of light and color, all of them leading back into you. Here the rules are clearer: every color is a feeling; every shape is a choice.

You realize: you haven’t been exploring a strange world. You’ve been walking through the palette of your own possibilities.

The canvas waits again—this time above you, like a low sky.

“What next?” the world asks, in your own voice.

You lift both hands, feeling that humming dust gathering again at your fingertips, and understand that in this dream, nothing is finished until you decide to wake up.

You smile, and begin to paint the one thing that has been missing:
a path, luminous and shifting, that leads in two directions at once—
one toward the comfort of waking,
and one deeper in, to all the worlds you haven’t dared to dream yet.
