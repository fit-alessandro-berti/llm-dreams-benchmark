As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and symbols etched into the dark wood – swirling vines intertwined with cryptic runes that seem to shift and writhe before your eyes.  The box itself feels strangely warm to the touch, almost pulsing with a faint inner light.  You run your fingers along the carvings, and one of the runes glows brighter, then sinks back into the wood.  Hesitantly, you trace it again, and this time, a small section of the box slides open, revealing not a keyhole, but a tiny, perfectly formed rose.  

The rose is made of some iridescent, almost liquid metal, shimmering with all the colours of a sunset.  As you reach for it, the box hums softly, and the rose seems to unfold, revealing a small, exquisitely crafted key nestled within its petals.  The key is not made of metal, but of polished bone, impossibly smooth and cool to the touch.  You feel a powerful pull, an undeniable urge to use it, to unlock whatever secrets lie within the box.  But as you reach for the key, the dream shifts, and the box dissolves into shimmering dust, leaving you standing in a field of endless sunflowers, their faces turned towards a brilliant, unseen sun. The scent of sunflowers and something else… something ancient and earthy… fills the air.  You know, somehow, that the key, and the secrets it held, are still within you.
