... written in a language you'd never seen before, swirling and undulating with an ancient, almost alien script. Symbols danced across the page, intricately weaving together. Panic clawed at my throat – this wasn't right.

The exam should have been in plain, old, familiar English, the language that was supposed to grant me access to the gleaming future of a Chronarch operative. It was a prestigious path, keeping the temporal tides in check, ensuring paradoxes didn't unravel the fabric of reality. My dream-self had studied day and night for this.

But this wasn't the quantifying time dilation equations I expected. This...this was unsettling. 

Taking a deep, steadying breath, I forced myself to look closer. Written in a strange script, they were just questions, I realised. Questions about things I'd never seen, in letters I couldn't decipher, numbers that seemed to pulsate and change. 

This was a dream, a vast and swirling, yet somehow unnerving echo of the future I strived for. The proctor, a bizarre amalgamation of a clockwork robot and a velvety deer, cleared its throat – the metallic clicking of gears strangely juxtaposed by the soft *thump* its throat made against the rough wood of the table. I tried to brush it off: my dream-self knew it was a dream, so it shouldn't have amounted to much. But in the strangeness of the dream-setting, his commanding voice echoed in my mind, sounding exactly like the ticking of a grandfather clock.

The man-deer's voice, once a murmur, grew firm and steady, a voice urging the exam to begin, hardly individualistic at all.

"Prepare yourself, young one," it said, its voice like the chime of a church bell. "This is not a test you can cheat your way through. Every word, every symbol, is tied to the fabric of the Torrent. These questions… they require you to look deep within yourself. Choose your path wisely, for it determines the fate of worlds, but remember, knowledge can be found in many languages. Speak the language of fate, and tell me: can you solve these riddles and tip the scales for your future?"

And there I was, frozen.

I knew the questions couldn't be solved by any definition of traditional understanding. The needles on the pronouncement, gears meshing with one another, whizzed around before settling in a chaotic dance, flickering as if unsure of themselves. This surreal impossible conversion to a language I couldn't even comprehend wouldn't deter me.

"Start with a simple system of deductions, deduce, and see." The words echoed in my mind, a whisper from my subconscious rather than the booming voice of the usual exam proctor. It felt… different, this proctor taking us through a fundamental truth selection exam – a stressful process regardless.

"This time, isn't like other times. The answers, they aren't to be found in the depths of text books… they're within you. Can you do that?" the man-deer's words were clear and calm now, almost mocking in how clear they were, considering the script itself was mangled and my head felt like a tangled heap of equations and anxieties flowing together.

...the clockwork deer spoke, its soft metallic tone laced with a strange, knowing amusement that seemed incongruous.



... My fingers trembled as I picked up the stylus.  This universe of turning points and alternate timelines, these only scattered fragmented glimpses of his future job titles. It wasn't adding or subtracting numbers
     – it's a representation of it.
