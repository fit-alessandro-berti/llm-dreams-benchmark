…in a language you’ve never seen before. The symbols twist and shift on the page—some look like spirals that hum faintly, others pulse like living ink. You blink hard, thinking it’s a trick of sleepless nights, but the words don’t change.

The invigilator—wearing a clock for a face—walks by and whispers, “You knew this test wouldn’t be about what you learned. It’s about who you become when you don’t understand.”

You look around. The other students aren’t writing. They're drawing: one sketches a door on their exam paper and begins to fold it into the shape of a bird; another is tearing their pages into strips, weaving them into a ladder that climbs toward the ceiling. A girl in the corner has turned her desk into a small garden, and flowers bloom where her answers should be.

You feel panic rise—until you notice your pen isn’t a pen at all. It’s a feather. And it’s warm.

You write your name at the top. The letters ripple, then dissolve into a flock of tiny paper birds that circle above your desk, whispering your memories back to you—not your grades, not your achievements, but the times you helped a stranger, laughed until you cried, stayed up to watch the stars.

The clock-faced invigilator stops in front of you. “Begin,” they say.

And you realize: the exam isn’t to be passed.  
It’s to be dreamed through.  

So you close your eyes,  
and write your heart into the next question.
