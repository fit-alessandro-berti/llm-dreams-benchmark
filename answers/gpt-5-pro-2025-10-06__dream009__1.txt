You are dreaming.

You wake to a sky with no lines in it—no contrails, no wires. The air tastes like wet iron. A river moves beside you, slow and brown. On the far bank, smoke rises from turf fires and a small cluster of timber buildings leans into the wind. A cart rattles past with wheels bound in iron and no rubber anywhere. Everything is wood, wool, leather, stone.

You pat your pockets and find nothing that hums, blinks, or answers. Your hands feel strangely light without a rectangle of certainty.

As you explore your new surroundings, you realize you need to choose what to be before anyone asks.

A woman with braided hair and a baby on her hip studies you the way people study weather. “From where?” she asks, and the answer “the future” feels like a bad idea in every era. You try on simpler words: “A traveler. A reader of signs.”

“Then read,” she says, and points to a sky that is already gathering rain.

You look up and remember the old constellations, the ones that haven’t changed since stories were bone and fire. The river bends east; moss clings on the north sides of stones; swallows skim low. You point toward a stand of alder and suggest they bring the wool inside. When the rain comes—soft at first, then thick as beads—the woman nods. It’s not proof, but it’s a beginning.

You realize you need to earn a place at the fire.

You carry wood. You keep quiet. You watch more than you speak. The people here live by verbs: mending, scraping, steeping, salting, drying. Everything takes time and hands. A boy slices his palm on a fish spine; you boil water and lay clean cloth, then press honey into the cut because you read once that honey keeps rot at bay. The boy hisses and the woman watches you with a new kind of attention—the kind that measures whether you are luck or danger. The cut closes like a taught mouth by morning.

“Reader,” the woman says, which is now your name. She pushes a small bowl toward you. “Eat.”

You realize you need to make something that stays when you sleep.

With a burnt stick you draw circles in the clay beside the hearth: the sun’s path through the seasons, the days’ lengths like ribs from solstice to solstice. You mark where the shadow falls at midday. The children press their thumbs into the wet clay and laugh. The men glance, shrug, and go back to nets. That night, however, an old man brings you a thin sliver of bone and asks, almost shy, if the marks can tell him when to set his traps upriver. You draw another circle, another rib. “When this shadow is short,” you say, “the river runs hard. After, it eases.”

You realize you need to wrap your knowledge in a story instead of a claim.

You find a broken needle, a shard of something like ore clinging to it. You rub the needle along the stone until it wants one direction more than another. You float it on a sliver of wood in a bowl. The bowl turns; the needle steadies. The old man watches as if you’ve asked the river to speak. “The world has a spine,” you say. “This is how to feel it with your hands.”

He laughs once—fright and delight married—and calls you a witch by the friendliest form of the word. You repeat a blessing you’ve heard in a museum audio guide, only simpler: “Be gentle with what points.” The bowl turns north. News travels faster than the river.

You realize you need to thread survival through belonging.

You learn the loom’s logic, how warp and weft have an argument that results in fabric. You sing to keep time when your palms blister. You teach them a knot that holds when wet and another knot that gives without a knife. In return you learn the names they’ve given wind: the one that smells like fish, the one that makes everything mean.

Midwinter arrives like a door that only opens inward. There is less of everything. The village has a habit of hunger that does not dramatize itself. You sketch a small kiln from sandstone and clay, glaze from ash. You fail twice; you do it again. You boil water with hot stones until it jumps, then show them how to steep bark into bitter tea when the coughs come. You scoop the last scrapings of salt from the barrel and explain, carefully, how to keep fish longer by packing them tighter. You remember more than you expected to remember.

You realize you need to keep the future from showing too brightly on your face.

When a girl with a fever burns too fiercely, you want to run to a medicine cabinet that doesn’t exist. You cool her with water, speak low, ask the stars for steady. She survives. The woman—the first to trust you—sits beside you at dawn and asks what you carry in your head and why you hide it.

“If I tell too much,” you say, “it changes the story too fast. Stories that change too fast break.”

She nods in a way that suggests she already knows. “Then tell us what doesn’t make people cruel.”

You think: soap before steel. Wells before walls. A calendar before a king.

You realize you need to decide whether you’re going home or making one here.

The dream complicates. On certain nights you wake again inside the dream, but in a different age’s costume: sand instead of mud, date palms instead of alder, a caravan’s bells instead of gulls. The same lesson follows you with a patient persistence: the people are different; the needs are not. Clean water. Reliable food. The counting of days. A way to decide together without breaking each other.

In the market of that other age, you trade a story for a measure of grain. You call it a game: everyone places a pebble in a jar for yes, in a basket for no. The decision becomes visible. Arguments become shorter, and sometimes kinder. Someone asks what the jar is called. You shrug. “Common sense.” They like that name; it tastes right in every mouth.

You realize you need to write something that cannot burn.

So you write on more than clay. You braid instructions into a song the children will not forget: how to boil, how to bind, how to leave enough seeds. You sew a different verse into a blanket’s border, knotting every fourth stitch long so the pattern repeats in a count of days. You scratch simple images on the inside of a wooden bowl: a hand washing, a fish in salt, a moon halved—maps disguised as memory.

Time in a dream is a pool without a clock, so it’s hard to say how long you live there. Long enough to be missed when you leave the room. Long enough to be known as the one who listens for what the world already wants to do.

And then, as dreams obey their own weather, you are back by the river that began it, the same woman with the baby now with a girl at her skirts and more silver in her hair. She squeezes your hand and presses something into your palm: a small disk fired from your clumsy kiln, stamped with a circle cut into quarters.

“For your pocket,” she says. “In case your next sky has lines in it and you forget how to find north.”

You realize you need to wake up because if you don’t, you might never choose.

You close your fingers around the disk. It is warm from her hand and heavy with the idea that none of this vanishes just because you open your eyes. The river speaks the same language in every century. The future is only the past with different tools.

When you finally lift your head from the pillow, the room accepts the light. Devices blink. The day waits with its small demands. In your pocket there is nothing but lint.

You hum the children’s song anyway, just to see what stays.
