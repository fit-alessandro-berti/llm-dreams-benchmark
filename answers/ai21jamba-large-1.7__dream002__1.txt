the wind picks up, rustling the leaves of the trees around you. The once-clear sky is now a swirling mass of dark clouds, and you hear the distant rumble of thunder. You quicken your pace, trying to find shelter, but the forest seems endless, and the storm is closing in fast.

Just as the first raindrops begin to fall, you see an old, abandoned cabin off in the distance. You rush toward it, your heart racing, the rain pouring down harder with each step. By the time you reach the cabin, you are soaked to the bone. The door creaks open, and you step inside, relieved to be out of the storm.

The cabin is small and dusty, with a few pieces of old furniture scattered about. There's a fireplace, and you quickly try to light a fire to dry off and warm up. As the fire crackles to life, you begin to feel a strange sensation, like you’re not alone. You look over your shoulder and see a figure standing in the shadows.

It’s an old woman with long gray hair, wearing a tattered dress. She smiles at you, her eyes glowing faintly in the dim light. “Welcome, traveler,” she says in a soft, raspy voice. “You’ve come just in time. The storm is only beginning.”

You feel a sense of unease but also can't help but feel drawn to her presence. She walks over to you and places a weathered hand on your shoulder, and you feel a warmth spread through your body, a feeling of peace and safety that you haven’t felt in a long time.

“You are safe here,” she says. “But there is much you must learn before the storm passes. Close your eyes, and let the forest guide you.”

You do as she says, and as you close your eyes, you feel yourself drifting off, as though you're floating. You see images, fragments of memories, and moments from your past, all swirling together in your mind. The storm outside seems to intensify, but you are calm, as though you're being protected by something ancient and powerful.

The old woman’s voice continues to speak, guiding you through the storm, and as you open your eyes, you realize that you are no longer in the cabin. You're standing in the middle of the forest, the storm gone, the sky clear and the sun shining down on you. The forest seems different now, more alive, more vibrant.

You hear the rustling of leaves behind you and turn to see the old woman standing there, her figure fading into the trees. “Remember this moment,” she says, her voice echoing in the stillness. “You are never alone in the forest, for it holds many secrets, and you are part of its story.”

You take one last look at the forest, feeling a newfound sense of peace and connection to the world around you, before you wake up.
