As I continue the dream:

You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to take a deep breath and try to calm your emotions before continuing the conversation.

You tell yourself that this is just a temporary state of mind, a fantasy created by your subconscious during sleep. You realize that no matter how intense the argument may seem, it doesn't reflect reality or your actual relationship with this person.

As you regain control over your surroundings, you find yourselves in a familiar living room. The arguing has passed its peak and now turns into a heated discussion about unresolved feelings and misunderstandings from the past.

Your friend lowers their voice and says that they never meant for anything to come between both of you. They apologize sincerely for any hurt caused during the argument and emphasize your importance to them as friends.

You respond by assuring them that you share similar sentiments, acknowledging any unintentional disagreements but emphasizing how much value this friendship holds in your life.

As the conversation continues, you see that the atmosphere has shifted from anger and frustration to empathy and understanding. Both of you start remembering all the good times spent together throughout the years and reaffirm that these memories make up for any recent misunderstandings or conflicts.

By the end of the argument, both sides understand each other better than ever before. There is no need for further discussion; instead, laughter fills the room as you realize how unnecessary this whole scenario was in your waking lives.

With a sudden shift back into reality, both you and your friend exchange fond smiles and warm hugs. As quickly as it started, the dream fades away leaving behind feelings of love, acceptance, and gratitude towards one another – proving that even though dreams can be vivid and intense at times, they never truly take hold of who we are in our waking lives.
