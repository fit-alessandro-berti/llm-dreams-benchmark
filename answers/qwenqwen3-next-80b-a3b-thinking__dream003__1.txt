The intricate patterns arenâ€™t just etched into the metalâ€”they *breathe*. As you lean closer, the lines shimmer like liquid starlight, shifting and coalescing into constellations youâ€™ve never seen before. They twist into spirals that seem to hum a low, resonant frequency in your bones. You reach out, fingertips hovering just above the cool surface, and the patterns ripple outward like water disturbed by a single drop. For a heartbeat, they form a perfect human handprintâ€”*yours*â€”before dissolving again.  

Then, without warning, the box dissolves. Not with a sound or a flash, but with a soft sigh, as if it had been waiting for you to *see* it. The metal melts into nine tiny, glowing orbs that orbit your head like miniature moons, each one pulsing with a different color: amethyst, coral, forest green, the deep blue of midnight ocean. One by one, they drift toward you, and as they touch your skin, you feel not pain, but recognition. A memory you didnâ€™t know you carried untangles inside you:  

*You once built a box like this, long ago. Not of metal, but of hopes and fears, of secrets you buried because they felt too heavy to carry. You built it to protect yourself, but it became a cage. And now, in this dream, youâ€™re the key.*  

The orbs dissolve into warm, golden light, flooding your chest. For the first time in years, you feel your heart openâ€”not with a bang, but with the quiet certainty of homecoming. The world around you blurs, and you realize youâ€™re not holding a box at all. Youâ€™re holding *yourself*.  

And then you wake upâ€”not to the sound of an alarm, but to the scent of rain on fresh earth, and the quiet hum of a door unfastening from the inside out.  

*(Dream complete. What will you carry with you when you open your eyes?)* ðŸ’«
