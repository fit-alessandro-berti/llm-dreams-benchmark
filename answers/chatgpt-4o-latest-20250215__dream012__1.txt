brace yourself against the howling wind. The deck pitches violently beneath your feet, and waves crash over the railings, drenching the crew. Lightning forks across the sky, illuminating the fear in their eyes.  

"Hold steady!" you shout, gripping the helm with both hands. The ship groans under the force of the storm, but you refuse to let it break.  

Suddenly, a shadow looms in the mist—a massive shape rising from the depths. The sea itself seems to shudder as a colossal, serpentine creature emerges, its glowing eyes fixed on your ship. The crew gasps in terror.  

"We’re not going down tonight," you growl, heart pounding. You draw your cutlass, though you know steel alone won’t save you.  

Then, from deep within, a memory stirs—an old legend told by sailors who never returned. The sea beast can be calmed, not fought. But only by speaking the words of the ancient mariners, words lost to time… or so you thought.  

As the storm rages, you close your eyes, feeling the pulse of the ocean in your veins. And then, the words come to you.  

What do you say?
