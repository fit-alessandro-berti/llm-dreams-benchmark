…Despite the hardships, you decide to stop moving for once.

Not to give up—just to choose.

You’ve been walking for so long that “survival” has become a reflex, a set of movements your body performs without asking your mind for permission. You loot, you ration, you avoid open streets, you sleep in places with only one door. You’ve gotten good at it in the way people get good at forgetting parts of themselves.

But now you’re standing in the middle of what used to be an intersection, and the wind keeps dragging a thin, papery sound across the asphalt—like someone turning pages.

You follow it.

Between two collapsed buildings, there’s a narrow crack where the sunlight doesn’t reach. Something hangs there, caught on rebar: a strip of cloth, a faded banner, letters half-peeled away. You tug it free and it comes loose with the sigh of old fabric.

It’s from a library.

That’s what the letters say, at least what’s left: **…PUBLIC LI…**. And suddenly, without meaning to, you remember the smell of paper and dust and carpet warmed by sun. You remember a life where you could walk into a building and expect it to still be there tomorrow.

The memory hits harder than hunger.

You look up. Across the street, behind a tilted bus and a spill of shattered concrete, is a set of steps descending underground. A station entrance, maybe. Or a service tunnel. The kind of place you’ve learned to avoid—dark, tight, impossible to run in.

Yet the banner in your hands makes you feel like you’ve been handed a direction instead of a warning.

You go down.

The air cools as if the world is exhaling. Your flashlight beam stutters over walls scribbled with old messages: names, dates, jokes that don’t land anymore. The stairs end in a corridor where water sits in shallow pools, reflecting your light in broken coins.

Then you hear it.

Not footsteps. Not the skitter of rats.

A steady, deliberate sound: *click… click… click…*

You freeze. Your hand finds the knife at your belt.

The clicking stops.

In the silence that follows, your own breathing sounds too loud. You angle your light toward the bend in the corridor, and for a moment you see nothing but damp concrete and peeling paint.

Then something shifts out of the darkness—a silhouette, low to the ground, moving in cautious increments.

A dog.

Or what looks like a dog at first: a lean shape with ribs showing, fur patchy, eyes reflecting white in your beam. Its tail doesn’t wag. It stands perfectly still as if it has learned that stillness is safer than friendliness.

Around its neck is a collar.

Not just any collar. A bright strip of red, the kind you’d never expect to survive here, attached to a small metal tag that flashes in your light.

It’s close enough now that you can read it.

**MARA.**

The dog—Mara—tilts her head and makes a sound you haven’t heard in a long time: a soft, uncertain huff, as if she’s trying out the idea of trust.

You lower the knife. Slowly. You crouch.

From your pocket you pull the last of your dried meat. You should save it. Your mind lists the reasons. Your body remembers what it felt like to share food with someone without calculating the cost.

You set the strip on the ground and slide it forward.

Mara doesn’t rush. She approaches like a creature that has been punished for wanting. She sniffs, takes it, then backs away in three careful steps.

You wait.

After she swallows, she looks past you, down the corridor, and lets out a low, insistent whine.

It’s not fear.

It’s urging.

“Okay,” you whisper, the word strange on your tongue. “Okay. Show me.”

Mara turns and limps toward the bend. You follow, heart ticking hard against your ribs. The corridor narrows. The air changes again, carrying something faint beneath the mold and rust—

Smoke.

Not the stale, long-dead smell of burned things.

Fresh smoke.

You round the corner and your light falls on a door half-opened, a maintenance door with a faded warning sign. Someone has wedged it so it doesn’t shut. A thread of warm air leaks through.

Mara noses it wider.

Inside is a room that shouldn’t exist in this world, a pocket of impossible order: shelves made from scavenged boards, jars lined up, bundles of herbs hanging from a pipe. A battery-powered lantern glows softly on a table, its light steady. A kettle sits on a little heater made from an old tin can and ingenuity.

And there are books.

Not many, but enough that your throat tightens. They’re stacked carefully in crates, wrapped in plastic, protected like medicine.

A figure stands near the table, back to you, hands held up as if they expected this moment all along.

They speak without turning.

“If you’re here to take,” the voice says, tired but calm, “take what you need and leave the door wedged. If you’re here to hurt me—”

They turn then, and you see a face lined with soot and sleeplessness, eyes bright with the sharpness of someone who has survived by noticing everything. In their hand, not a gun, but a short crowbar held like a last argument.

They look at Mara first, and something in their expression softens.

“You followed her,” they say.

You nod, not trusting your voice.

Mara walks between you and them as if she is a bridge and a warning at the same time. She presses briefly against the stranger’s leg, then comes back to you, sniffing your hand, choosing you again.

The stranger lowers the crowbar a fraction.

“You’re not from the south camps,” they say. It isn’t a question.

“No.”

A pause. The lantern hums. The kettle makes a small, domestic sound that feels like a miracle.

“What’s your name?” they ask.

You tell them.

They repeat it like they’re placing it on a shelf where it won’t get lost.

“I’m Rian,” they say. “And before you ask—no, there’s no trick. No traps. Just… this.”

They gesture at the room. The books. The jars. The carefulness.

You swallow. “Why?”

Rian’s mouth tightens, almost a smile, almost grief.

“Because I got tired of only being what the world needed me to be,” they say. “I got tired of the only skill that mattered being how to take and how to run. So I started collecting things that don’t help—until they do.”

They pick up one of the books and tap its cover lightly.

“Stories. Instructions. Old maps. Poems.” Their gaze lifts to you. “Do you remember poems?”

The question lands like the library smell in your mind. Like a door opening onto air you forgot existed.

You try to answer, but what comes out is a small, cracked sound between laughter and crying.

Rian watches you with the quiet patience of someone who has seen this before.

Mara sits. Her tail thumps once against the floor, hesitant but real.

Rian turns to the kettle. “Tea?” they ask, as if offering tea in the end of the world is the most normal thing in existence.

You look at the shelves, at the neat stacks, at the lantern’s steady glow.

You think of the road above: the wind, the empty buildings, the constant calculation.

You think of the banner in your hand, the torn words that led you here.

You realize this is what you decided, back at the intersection, even before you understood it.

Not just to survive.

To build something small enough to carry, but solid enough to return to.

“Yes,” you say. Your voice steadies. “Tea.”

Rian nods, and for the first time you notice that they’re shaking, just a little—adrenaline wearing off, fear finally allowed to exist.

“We can’t keep everyone safe,” they say softly, almost to themself. “But we can keep something.”

Mara leans her head against your knee.

The lantern light warms your hands as you sit at the table. Outside, somewhere far above, the ruined world continues—hungry, loud, and indifferent.

But here, in this hidden room that smells faintly of smoke and paper, you feel something you haven’t felt since before the sky changed:

The sensation of tomorrow being more than a threat.

The dream holds on that moment—the kettle beginning to whistle, the pages of a book lifting slightly in the warm air, your fingers hovering over a title you can barely read—

—and then you wake with the word **PUBLIC** still bright in your mind, as if your sleeping self found a place worth returning to.
