...and you stand at the wheel, salt-crusted lashes blinking against the horizontal rain, feeling the deck pitch forty degrees beneath your bare feet. Lightning forks across the sky, illuminating the faces of your crew (some praying, some already halfway to ghosts) clinging to the railings like broken marionettes.

You laugh.

Not a brave laugh, not a mad laugh; just the low, inevitable chuckle of someone who has finally remembered the punchline to a joke the ocean told you years ago.

“Listen,” you shout over the wind, voice somehow cutting clean through the roar, “this isn’t a storm. This is the sea waking up cranky because we forgot to knock.”

A wave the size of a cathedral crashes over the bow. The ship groans like an old lover who’s been asked to dance one more time. The mainmast cracks, splinters the color of bone exploding upward into the black.

You let go of the wheel.

The crew screams as the ship spins beam-to the waves, but you’re already moving, coat flapping like torn sails, climbing the tilting deck toward the prow. You reach the bowsprit, wrap one arm around the jib line, and lean out into the storm’s open mouth.

“Hey!” you bellow at the ocean itself, rain sheeting off your words. “I know you’re in a mood, but we’ve got places to be and you’re hogging the road!”

Thunder answers, rolling so close it feels like a hand clapping over your heart. For one impossible second the storm pauses, curious.

You grin, teeth bright against the dark. “Fine. You want tribute? Take it.”

You pull the captain’s log from inside your coat (every voyage, every port, every name of every soul who ever sailed with you) and hurl it into the waves. The leather-bound book spins once, twice, then vanishes into a wall of green water.

The sea exhales.

The wind drops from shriek to whisper in the space of a heartbeat. The waves flatten as if someone has smoothed them with a giant palm. Moonlight (impossible, impossible moonlight) spills through a sudden rent in the clouds, turning the deck silver.

Your crew stares at you, soaked and shaking. The helmsman’s knuckles are white on the useless wheel.

You walk back amidships, leaving wet footprints that steam in the new quiet.

“Raise the colors,” you say softly. “We’re late for tomorrow.”

As the black flag with the white hourglass snaps aloft, you add, almost to yourself:

“Dreams don’t sink ships, lads. Forgetting you’re in one does.”

The ocean, now gentle as a sleeping beast, carries you forward into the clearing night. Behind you, the storm folds itself up like a bad memory and follows at a respectful distance, grumbling but polite.

Because even storms know better than to argue with a captain who finally remembered whose dream this really is.
