a paintbrush that seems to pulse with the heartbeat of the shifting world. Intrigued, I dip it into the air itself, drawing from the swirling hues around me—crimson waves crashing into emerald spirals. With each stroke, the canvas doesn't just fill; it comes alive, birthing creatures of ink and light that leap off the surface, inviting me to chase them through forests of melting clocks and rivers of liquid stars. But as the dream deepens, the canvas whispers a secret: every creation alters the landscape, turning my steps into echoes of forgotten melodies, pulling me deeper into the ever-evolving dream. What happens next? The colors decide.
