You are walking through a peaceful forest when suddenly the weather changes dramatically. You feel a storm approaching and the air grows heavy, charged with an almost metallic tang. The gentle rustle of leaves gives way to a frantic, desperate whisper as the wind begins to pick up, tearing through the canopy. The sky above, moments ago dappled with sunlight, curdles into an oppressive bruised purple, then a swirling, inky black that seems to press down on the very top of your head.

A jagged white scar rips across the darkness, followed by a deafening *CRACK* that vibrates through the very ground beneath your feet, making your teeth ache. The first fat drops of rain hit your face, cold as ice, then instantly a torrential downpour unleashes itself, blurring the world into a streaky watercolor. You instinctively quicken your pace, looking for an overhang, a dense thicket, anything. But the forest, once a sanctuary, now feels menacing. The trees twist and writhe like tormented spirits, their branches lashing wildly, and the path you were following vanishes under a sudden deluge of water, becoming a churning, muddy stream. You feel utterly exposed, the wind tearing at your clothes, the rain soaking you to the bone.

Just as despair begins to settle in, a flickering light catches your eye through the rain-lashed trees. It's not lightning, but a soft, pulsing luminescence, deep within the darkest part of the wood, where you hadn't noticed a path before. It seems to beckon, a faint, almost melodic hum carried on the wind, oddly comforting amidst the chaos. You hesitate for only a moment, then, driven by an instinct beyond reason, push through the thrashing undergrowth towards it. The storm rages around you, but as you draw closer to the light, an impossible stillness seems to descend. The wind dies down, the rain lessens to a gentle patter, and the thunder becomes a distant rumble, like a giant clearing its throat far, far away.

The light intensifies, revealing not a shelter, but a clearing you've never seen before. In its center stands a single, ancient tree, its bark swirling with luminous patterns, its leaves shimmering with the same soft glow, completely untouched by the storm that still surrounds the rest of the forest. And beneath its branches, nestled in a bed of moss that seems to pulse with the same inner light, a small, intricate wooden box rests, waiting. It emanates a warmth that reaches out to you, a gentle invitation to step into the quiet eye of the storm.
