**...not questions at all.**

They are intricate, shifting lattices of light projected onto the smooth, obsidian desk. The room—which moments ago was a brightly lit lecture hall—has grown cold and vast, stretching into an echoing darkness above me. The only light source comes from the desk, illuminating my trembling hands.

The first "question" solidifies: it is a perfectly rendered, three-dimensional miniature diorama of my childhood bedroom, but the colors are all wrong—the walls are the color of old blood, and the carpet is perpetually wet. A tiny, ghostly version of my 10-year-old self sits crying in the corner. The prompt beneath the scene reads simply: **"Justify the regret."**

I look around desperately. The proctor, a stern figure with the head of a silent, watchful crow, taps a single clawed finger on his ledger. Time is running.

I pick up my pen, but the point disintegrates into black sand when it touches the glowing desk surface. I realize the exam requires no written response.

The second question appears, dissolving the bedroom diorama. It is a single, massive, churning cloud of sound—a cacophony that sounds like every argument I’ve ever lost played backward, accompanied by the high-pitched shriek of an untuned radio. The text beneath the noise flickers: **"Identify the exact frequency required to silence this fear, and then perform it."**

My heart is pounding so violently it feels like it’s vibrating the chair. My future career—the one that will define my entire worth—depends on me performing a sound that can literally silence existential dread.

I try to move my mouth, but the sound that comes out is just a dry rasp. The Crow Proctor clears its throat—a sound like grinding gravel—and the room begins to tilt.

As the third and final question begins to materialize—I recognize the shape of my elderly grandmother's favorite rocking chair, poised precariously on the edge of a deep abyss—I abandon the concept of the exam entirely. I realize that the only way to pass is to refuse the premise.

I slam my hands onto the glowing desk. The light explodes outward, and the classroom shatters like a pane of ice. I am falling, but I am not scared.

I look down and see that I am no longer in my exam clothes; I am wearing a deep-sea diving suit, heavy with bronze and glass. The chair, the proctor, and the impossible questions are falling away above me, replaced by an endless, silent, dark blue ocean. The final question floats past like a dying jellyfish—a silent, glowing decree: **"Where is the surface?"**

I do not look up. I pull the heavy bronze handle on my chest, sealing the suit, and continue to descend, knowing that the only direction I can travel is deeper, toward whatever strange, luminous career awaits me at the crushing pressure of the absolute bottom.
