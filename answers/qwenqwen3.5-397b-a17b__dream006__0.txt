...speak, but my voice is not my own. It sounds like the ocean roaring inside a shell. As the first sentence leaves my lips, the words materialize in the air, glowing neon blue, hanging suspended like smoke. The audience reaches up to touch them, and where their fingers brush the letters, the text bursts into butterflies.

I try to remember my next line, but the podium turns into a tree trunk, rough and warm under my palms. The spotlight expands, swallowing the darkness, and I realize the crowd is no longer watching me—they are waiting for me to fly. I look down and see my feet are no longer touching the floor, and the sensation of falling upward pulls me gently into the wings, where the curtain tastes like static electricity and the dream fades into the hum of morning.
