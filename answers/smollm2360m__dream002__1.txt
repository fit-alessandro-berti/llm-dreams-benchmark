In this moment of heightened tension, all I see is a sudden change of landscape. A dark foreboding cloud forms before my eyes in the distance, as if waiting to unleash its fury upon us. The sound of raindrops hitting against tree branches fills my ears like a relentless drumbeat. I slowly feel my fear rising, and my heart sinks into my throat. This is a new experience I have not anticipated - perhaps a terrifying storm awaits me?
