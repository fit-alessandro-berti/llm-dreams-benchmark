written in a language you can't understand. Your heart races as you try to make sense of the symbols on the page, but they seem to shift and morph into different shapes before your eyes. You glance around the room and see that everyone else is calmly answering their questions, as if they don't even notice the bizarre transformation happening on your paper.

Feeling increasingly panicked, you raise your hand to get the attention of the proctor, but as you do, you realize that your voice is muffled, as if you're speaking through water. The proctor, a stern figure with an unyielding gaze, looks at you with a mix of disapproval and pity. They shake their head slightly, as if to say, "You should have studied harder."

Determined not to give up, you take a deep breath and force yourself to focus. Suddenly, the symbols on the page begin to stabilize, and you recognize a few words here and there. You realize that the language is a combination of familiar and unfamiliar elements, like a puzzle you need to piece together. You start to write down your answers, using logic and intuition to fill in the gaps.

As you work through the exam, you gradually gain confidence. The symbols become clearer, and you start to understand the underlying patterns. By the time you reach the last question, you feel a sense of accomplishment. You finish the exam and hand it in, feeling a mix of relief and pride.

Just as you leave the room, you wake up, feeling a sense of determination to face whatever challenges come your way in the real world.
