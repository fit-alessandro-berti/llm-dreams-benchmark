The air, moments ago alive with birdsong, grew heavy and still. The dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves vanished as if someone had snuffed out a candle. A nervous prickle started at the base of my neck and crawled up my scalp. This wasn't just a shift in the weather; it was a *rupture*.

The first rumble was distant, a low growl that vibrated in my chest. Then, the wind, a playful zephyr just seconds before, transformed into a howling beast. It tore through the canopy, whipping branches into a frenzy. Leaves, torn from their moorings, swirled around me like a demented blizzard. The peaceful forest became a maelstrom of chaos.

A blinding flash of lightning split the sky, followed by a thunderclap that shook the ground beneath my feet. The rumble grew into a deafening roar as the storm descended with terrifying speed. Fat raindrops, cold as ice, began to pelt down, soaking through my clothes in seconds. 

I squinted through the deluge, trying to find shelter, but the trees offered no protection. They were thrashing wildly, their branches like skeletal arms reaching out to snatch me. Panic started to rise in my throat, a cold, metallic taste. This wasn't a normal storm; it felt… sentient. Malevolent. 

Another blinding flash revealed something in the distance, a flicker of light that wasn't lightning. It pulsed with an eerie, unnatural glow, beckoning me through the raging tempest. Against my better judgment, I found myself drawn towards it. My legs, numb with cold and fear, moved of their own accord, stumbling over roots and through the churning mud.

As I pushed deeper into the storm, the light grew brighter, revealing the silhouette of a structure unlike anything I'd ever seen. It was a tower, impossibly tall, constructed of what looked like obsidian, shimmering with the same strange, pulsating energy I'd seen before. The wind howled around it, but it stood firm, a defiant monolith against the fury of the storm.

The closer I got, the more unsettling the feeling became. The tower radiated a sense of… anticipation, as if it had been waiting for me. I reached the base and looked up, the structure stretching into the inky blackness above, swallowed by the storm clouds. 

Suddenly, the wind ceased. The rain stopped as abruptly as it had begun. The thunder fell silent. The only sound was the rhythmic pulsing of the tower's strange energy. And then, a voice, cold and resonant, echoed through the unnatural stillness, whispering my name…  

And I woke up.
