...the moment your fingers brush its surface, the canvas inhales—a deep, silent pull—and the entire world around you freezes. The swirling turquoise vines overhead stop mid-thrash. The sky, once a molten blend of tangerine and lilac, solidifies like cooled resin. Even the air feels thick, like wading through gelatin.

Then, from somewhere beyond the horizon, a single note hums—low, resonant, like a cello played underwater. The canvas trembles. Colors start to bleed upward from its edges, not painted, but *emerging*, as if memories returning. A field of midnight-blue flowers unfurls across its surface, each petal tipped with silver that glows brighter when you blink.

You notice something odd: every shape that appears on the canvas now echoes faintly in the world around you. A spiral blooms on the canvas—and suddenly, a faint spiral swirls in the dust at your feet. You didn’t paint it. But it responded.

And then, a whisper—not in your ear, but inside your bones: *"You’re not the artist here. You’re the permission."*

What do you paint next?
