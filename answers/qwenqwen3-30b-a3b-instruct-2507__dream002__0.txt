...the sky splits open like a bruised fruit. Thunder rips the air, not as a boom, but as a physical *shock* that rattles your bones. Rain doesn't fall – it *hurts*. Each drop stings like icy needles, driven sideways by winds that howl with voices – not human, but ancient, fragmented whispers in languages you shouldn't understand. The peaceful forest becomes a nightmare: trees twist like tortured limbs, their bark peeling back to reveal veins of pulsating, bioluminescent green light that throb in time with the storm’s sickening heartbeat.

You stumble, slipping on slick, obsidian-black stones that weren't there before. The path vanishes, swallowed by a sudden, impossible fog that isn't grey, but *screams* with shifting colours – crimson, violet, deep ocean blue – swirling like liquid nightmares. Within it, distorted shapes move: figures with too many limbs, trees with faces that weep black sap, roots that writhe like serpents seeking purchase in your ankles.

Then, a sound cuts through the cacophony – a single, pure note, like a bell forged from moonlight. It’s coming from a clearing ahead, where the storm rages *around* a small, perfect circle of silence. In the center stands an old, weathered oak, but its bark is smooth, warm to the touch, and covered in intricate, glowing runes that pulse softly. At its base lies a child's stuffed rabbit, one button eye missing, the other gleaming with the same soft, green light as the tree’s veins. It’s *calling* you.

The storm screams, the whispering winds claw at your skin, the fog tries to swallow you whole. But the rabbit, still and silent in its pocket of calm, seems to *know* you. It’s the only thing that feels real. You take a step forward, the stinging rain biting your face, the ground trembling beneath you. The choice is terrifying: stay in the maddening storm, or step into the impossible silence, trusting a toy and a tree that shouldn't exist in this place of screaming light and tearing wind? The silence feels heavier than the storm. The rabbit’s single, glowing eye holds yours, waiting. You reach out, your hand trembling. The moment your fingers brush the warm, velvety fur, the world *tilts*. The storm doesn't stop. It *stops* for *you*.
