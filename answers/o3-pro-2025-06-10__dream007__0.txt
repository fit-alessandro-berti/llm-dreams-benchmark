…pause before either of you says something you can’t take back.  
The moment you step away, the world around you shifts—as it often does in dreams—but you notice it only after the air grows impossibly still. Your friend’s words hang in the silence like ripples frozen mid-water.

You decide to take a walk to clear your head, and the living room door opens into a moonlit shoreline that shouldn’t exist inside an apartment. Silver sand crunches underfoot. The ocean is calm but strange: each wave carries faint, glowing letters that dissolve before you can read them. Somewhere behind you, your friend follows, footsteps echoing with the sound of pages turning.

“I don’t want us to drift,” you say, unsure whether you’re speaking to your friend or the sea itself. The beach answers first: a wave rolls up and leaves two shells arranged side by side, identical spirals mirroring each other.

Your friend kneels to pick them up. “Maybe we’re hearing different tides,” they murmur, handing one to you. The shell hums—a soft vibration like a distant cello note—and when you raise it to your ear you don’t hear the ocean; you hear your own voice reciting the very point you were trying to make during the argument. It sounds clearer, kinder, stripped of the anger you felt moments ago.

Your friend listens to their shell and winces. “I didn’t realize how sharp I sounded,” they say. “This… actually helps.”

You walk together along the glowing surf. With every step, older memories appear in the sand: a shared joke, a childhood dare, the time you both laughed so hard you fell off a park bench. Each memory is etched in phosphorescent footprints that fade as quickly as they appear, but their warmth lingers in your chest.

Eventually you reach a pier made of dark glass. At its end stands a door with no walls, floating upright. Painted on it in slow-dripping starlight are the words: Speak what matters.

You turn to your friend. There’s no anger left, only the quiver of vulnerability. “I was afraid you’d choose this over us,” you confess, naming the very thing at the heart of the dispute. The words leave you lighter.

Your friend draws a slow breath. “I was afraid I’d lose myself if I compromised,” they admit. Their shell falls apart into shimmering sand that swirls between you both, forming a single question mark before scattering into the wind.

You reach for the doorknob together. The door swings open onto the original room where the argument began, except now sunlight pours in, and the walls are lined with every book you’ve ever lent one another. It feels smaller than you remember, but warmer, too.

Neither of you remembers exactly what you say next—dreams blur at the edges—but you know the tone: soft, attentive, alive with possibility. You wake with the sensation of two shells clicking together in your palm and the taste of salt-cool forgiveness on your tongue.
