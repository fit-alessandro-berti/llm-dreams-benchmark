# The Dream

You are in the middle of a heated argument with a close friend. The disagreement is about something important to both of you, and you decide to **stop talking altogether.**

Not storm off. Not capitulate. Just... stop.

The silence lands between you like a physical object. Your friend's mouth is still half-open, loaded with the next volley, but the words dissolve. You watch them flicker — confused, then angry, then something rawer.

And that's when the room starts to change.

The walls soften. Not metaphorically — they literally begin to breathe, expanding and contracting like lungs. The floor beneath you turns translucent, and you can see down through layers: root systems, underground rivers, the bones of ancient things neither of you can name.

Your friend looks down too. You both do.

"Do you see that?" they whisper. The argument is forgotten — not resolved, just... irrelevant against the scale of what's beneath you.

There's a sound rising from below. Not music exactly, but something *organized*. A hum with intention. You realize it's been there the whole time, under every conversation you've ever had with this person, under every laugh and every silence and every fight.

Your friend reaches out their hand. Not as an apology. Not as surrender. Just because the ground is becoming less solid and you both need something to hold onto.

You take it.

The floor gives way.

You fall together into warm darkness, and the falling feels less like danger and more like the moment just before understanding — that breathless space where you haven't figured it out yet, but you *know* you're about to.

You're still falling when—

*You wake up.*

And for the rest of the day, you can't shake the feeling that the argument you had with them last week matters both more and less than you thought.
