...and the grooves breathe, like the ripples left by a bird on a still lake. The more you look, the more the patterns seem to move of their own accord—vines looping into knots into spirals into something like the night sky if the stars had chosen to curl instead of burn.

You tilt the box and it tilts you back. In the lacquer you catch your own face for a moment, not quite your own; younger, perhaps, or older, the way memory misremembers when you’re not watching. The corners of the box are scuffed, but lovingly. Someone has held this before you. Someone has worried the edge with a thumb the way you are now.

You run your fingertip along the pattern. It is not simply decorative. It rises and dips in tiny terraces, a relief map of a country you can't place, a coastline you almost name. When your nail grazes a tight little knot near the hinge, a sound comes from inside—a small click like a distant seed opening in sunlight. You hold your breath. The box holds it with you.

The room around you has no walls, only curtains of dust falling in shafts of light that may be moonlight and may be water. The floor is the idea of floor. The box is the only thing that feels true. You bring it closer. There's a scent, faint and impossible: hot summer dust just after rain, library glue, crushed mint.

Between the spirals you notice tiny symbols worked into the wood. They are minuscule, like the text in dreams you can never quite bring into focus. When you look straight at them they slide away, but when you look through them you see that they make constellations—not of the sky you know, but of old stories. A whale that is also a ship. A house that is also a heart. A door that is also a mouth.

You hold up your palm to the lid, as if to measure it. The lines of your hand echo the etched lines. Without thinking, you align your lifeline with a river carved across the top. There is a warmth that isn’t heat, the way a word you've been searching for feels when it finally arrives. The carvings hum, a tiny, insect-wing whir that settles into a frequency you recognize only because you can feel it in your bones: the pace of your heartbeat when you were ten and running downhill, the way you counted the steps.

“Say it,” someone whispers, although no one is there. The voice is the sea inside a shell. Say what? Say nothing. Or say the name you have not used in years, the one you were called only once in a dream. You try it. You try them all. The box answers none of them.

Then you notice the missing piece—not on the box, but on you. A small crescent-shaped scar at the base of your thumb, white like chalk. It fits perfectly into a crescent-shaped hollow on the lid, something you hadn’t seen until now. You press your scar to it, and there’s another click, closer this time, like a mechanical bird deciding to trust you.

The lid trembles, then unfurls, not up but outward, like a flower that had forgotten how to bloom and then remembered in the middle of the night. Inside, there is no velvet, no lock, no jangling treasure. Inside there is weather. A cloud the size of a breath drifts past your face. Lightning flickers silently within it and outlines the tiny furniture of a childhood room. The box smells now of warm milk teeth left under pillows, of the green edge of a pool on the last day of summer, of cold coins and old cameras and the graphite of chewed pencils.

Floating just above the bottom is a folded paper crane. Its wings are covered in handwriting you can almost read. When you look away, the words soar; when you look back, they land and refuse to be caught. You reach in and the box deepens the closer your hand goes, so that your arm is descending into a well and, just when you think you will never reach, your fingers touch something not paper, not wood: pulse.

You lift it out. It is a key, but not metal. It is made of light held together by a decision. It weighs as much as a thought. It hums in your palm. On one side, the teeth are cut in the pattern of the route you used to take home from school; on the other, the grooves are the skyline of a city you have not yet visited. It occurs to you that this key will not turn any lock in this room, or any lock with a keyhole. It will turn a sentence. It will unlock a breath. It will open the next thing that asks to be opened.

The lid, patient as an eyelid, blinks. The cloud retreats. The paper crane bows and quietly becomes a fish, then a leaf, then a moth that beats once and dissolves into dust that is not quite dust, that is the same light you woke up in once last winter when the sun slipped behind the curtain at exactly the angle to make you think of snow.

You set the key back and the box won’t have it, refusing to accept the return as if some bargains only go one way. The light key softens and lengthens and becomes the line of your palm again. There is a warm ache where your scar meets the wood. The patterns have changed subtly, as if the map has been updated; a new path drawn, a small bridge sketched where there wasn’t one before.

You close the lid. It is heavier now and also lighter. You put it to your ear and listen. Inside, there is the sound of distant waves, of a train arriving in a station you are not standing in, of someone turning pages in the dark. You say thank you, without knowing who you are thanking. The box says you’re welcome, without making a sound.

When you look up, the room has walls again, or maybe it never did. Morning is trying on the edges of the curtains. You tuck the box beneath your arm. It is exactly the size of your heart. You promise to try the key on laughter today, on a door that looks like a face, on a fear that has been pretending to be furniture.

And because this is a dream, you don’t have to explain to anyone why your pockets are full of weather, and why your hands smell like rain.
