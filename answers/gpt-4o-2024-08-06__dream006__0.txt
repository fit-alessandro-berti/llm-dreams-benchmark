speak, but suddenly, the words escape you. You pause, feeling the weight of their silence. The auditorium feels vast, and each moment stretches into an eternity. Just as you begin to panic, you notice someone in the crowd—their face is calming, familiar, almost like an old friend. As your eyes lock, you feel a surge of confidence, a sense of warmth spreading through you.

Suddenly, the room begins to transform. The walls ripple like water, and the ceiling opens up to reveal a sky filled with vibrant colors. The audience remains seated, but their expressions shift from anticipation to ones of wonder and encouragement. Feeling emboldened, you start speaking once more, and your voice emerges, strong and clear, resonating with every corner of the room.

The speech flows effortlessly now, each word carrying a sense of purpose and connection. As you continue, the audience begins to rise, not in departure, but as if lifted by some unseen force, floating gently into the air. They are smiling, nodding in understanding and agreement, and you feel an overwhelming sense of unity and shared experience.

As you reach the crescendo of your speech, the ceiling above transforms into a dazzling display of stars, swirling and dancing in harmony with your words. The boundary between you and the audience dissolves, and you all share the same weightless ascent, a collective dream within a dream.

And as you finish, the world slowly returns to normal. The audience gently lands in their seats, the ceiling closes, and the room settles back into its familiar shape. You stand there on the stage, feeling the powerful echo of the dream linger around you, leaving you with a sense of wonder and the realization that you were never truly alone.
