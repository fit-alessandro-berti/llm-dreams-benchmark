…the floor seems to re-tile itself every few steps—carpet to marble to lacquered wood to something that looks like the surface of a pond when wind combs it. Music slides in and out of key. Everyone wears a name tag, but the tags are printed with verbs instead of names: *Hesitates*, *Forgets*, *Collects*, *Sings Quietly*. Your tag is blank, as if it’s waiting for you to do something first.

You spot a cluster of people sharing a single drink—passing it from hand to hand like a microphone.

“We’re tasting the year,” one of them says. “You can tell by the afterthought.”

You ask if they’ve seen your friend. You describe their jacket, their laugh, the way they throw a hello like a pebble that skips three times.

“We saw someone wearing Mondays,” another says, as though days are clothing. “They went toward the room where the ceiling is lower than the floor.”

You nod as if that explains anything. It does, in the way dream directions always do: you look up to look down and the hallway tilts obligingly.

In a side room a dozen people are comparing keys. Not to doors—just keys. They hold them up to the light, tasting them like hard candy. One jingles a handful and you hear rain. Another lays her key on the table and it casts a shadow shaped like a map.

“Which one opens *now*?” you ask.

A man with a key on a ribbon shrugs. “Now opens itself.”

He points his chin to a buffet designed like a globe: continents carved from cheese; islands of crackers; rivers of honey. Tiny paper flags label regions with memories: *First Kiss*, *Almost*, *Not This Time*. Stuck into Greenland is a flag with your friend’s initials. When you pull it out, the icebergs clink against the sides of the bowl like glass.

“Upstairs,” the man says. “Follow the carpet that changes its mind.”

The stairs are braided together, three twisting into one. You pick the strand that hums. On the second landing a circle of people are practicing laughter like scales—ha, haha, hahahaha—quiet to loud and back again. Their timing is off by half a second, so everything feels dubbed.

“Our teacher went ahead,” says someone in the circle when you ask again. “Their laugh arrives before they do. If you hear it, you’re too late. Or right on time.” He shuffles to make room for you. “Both are the same hallway here.”

A server drifts by with a tray of drinks that glow faintly. The cocktail napkins are printed with floor plans. Each napkin shows a different version of the building, and in the top corner a star marks *You Are Here*. You grab one, but when you look down the star has slid to a different room, as if embarrassed to be caught.

In the ballroom the chandelier is practicing being a constellation. Beneath it, people trade picture frames like stories. They hold the empty frames in front of their faces as they speak, their features aligning to the borders; then they swap and their expressions snap into new shapes.

“Try it,” says a woman who smells like rain. She lifts a frame to you. The glass is gone, just air and gilt.

You hold it up. The woman peers at you through it and smiles with relief. “Oh good,” she says. “Now you look familiar.”

“Have you seen—?” you start.

“Rooftop,” she says. “Where the wind rehearses names.”

You try an elevator. The buttons are labeled with verbs too: *Rise*, *Pause*, *Rethink*, *Open*, *Arrive*. You touch *Arrive* and the elevator descends three inches, then sighs upward. Between floors it stops to consider. A bell dings like a spoon tapping crystal. The doors part to a greenhouse that smells of wet leaves and new paint. People are cross-pollinating conversation, gently brushing topics from one bloom to another.

Your phone buzzes. A message from your friend: *on my way*. The letters float a moment above the screen like moths, then settle. You glance up and everyone in the greenhouse is holding a phone, reading *on my way* with your friend’s name attached. A brief thrill of embarrassment passes through the room like a draft. Then it’s gone. No one says anything. You put the phone back in your pocket. It’s not even your phone, you realize. It’s heavier, older, someone else’s wallpaper.

You follow the sound of cutlery politely failing to touch plates. In a corridor lined with coats like furred shadows, you pass a cloaked figure murmuring into a bouquet. “I’m late,” they tell the flowers. “But I brought everyone’s childhood.” The bouquets answer in low, leafy voices. You can’t make out the words, only the shape of them: apology, reunion, cake.

A door opens onto an indoor pool the color of eyelids. The water is not water but a tiled field of tiny, shifting mirrors. People stand around it and toss their reflections in like coins. The room smells of chlorine and summer hours. On the far side, someone in your friend’s jacket leans over the surface, mailing their face back to themselves. It could be them. It could be anyone. When you step close, the water thickens, going from liquid to slow glass. It holds your reflection at a distance, as if you are a photograph it hasn’t decided to develop.

“You made it,” says a voice behind you that you recognize before you understand. You turn.

It’s them—or it’s your memory of them rendered in high resolution. The jacket is right. The grin, the tilt of the head, the way their joy locates the edges of the room. But there’s something else: a version of their face you haven’t seen yet, like a word you know the meaning of but haven’t spoken aloud.

“I kept looking,” you say, and realize you sound accusatory. “Everyone kept almost being you.”

“That’s what a party is,” they say. “Almosts getting practiced into yes.”

They hand you a folded seating chart. The paper is warm, soft as fabric. You unfold it. Every table has your name at one place setting. Different handwriting each time. Different spellings. At the very center is a small table labeled *For the Person You Came For*. The chair there is empty, but alive with the kind of emptiness that suggests someone just stood up.

“I don’t want to sit without you,” you tell them, aware of how childish it sounds.

“What if we tried this the other way?” they say gently. They turn the chart upside down. From this angle you see another set of names printed in faint ink beneath the obvious ones—the ghost layer they meant for themselves. At each table, beside your name, their name too. It was always paired; you just read it right-side up and missed it.

You look up. The room is widening, or you are. At the pool’s edge the mirrors settle back into water for a few forgiving seconds. You see both of you in it, and also everyone you’ve already spoken to, and everyone you will. The laughter circle practicing at a distance. The key collectors. The framed faces. The people tasting the year. It folds in a quiet, non-dramatic way, like a pocket map remembering it was once a forest.

“I thought I only knew one person here,” you say.

“You do,” they answer, and gesture around you. “You’re doing great.”

You blink. The chandelier finally commits to being a constellation, and the room makes a soft, pleased sound. A breeze moves across your skin as if some door very far away, very high up, has opened. You realize the name tag on your chest has filled itself in. It doesn’t say your name. It says *Finds*. Your friend’s tag says *Found*.

“Rooftop?” you suggest, because the wind is whispering letters again.

They nod. Together you take the elevator that only goes to places you say out loud. “Arrive,” you tell it. It purrs. When the doors open the air tastes like citrus and sky, and the city is a geometry of lights that recalculates around you—the way a crowd shifts to make room for latecomers.

The rooftop is strung with unlit bulbs that glow anyway. People you’ve met below are up here too, redistributed like furniture that finally makes sense: the key on a ribbon is now a necklace; the picture frames hold the horizon; the laughers keep time with the wind. Someone hands you a drink the color of a good decision. Your friend clinks their glass against yours. The sound is small and precise and rings longer than it should.

“What were we talking about?” you ask, though you never began.

“Everything,” they say. “But we can start anywhere.”

You start with the weather. You start with the view. You start with that time you both were late and it worked out. Each beginning turns into a story that knows how to land. The ache of searching unknots without ceremony. If there is an ending, it’s not a door closing. It’s the party that recognizes you when you look back; it nods, and shifts, and keeps making space.

Later, a violin down in the ballroom tunes a single string, an A that asks everyone to agree. No one shushes anyone else. The rooftop hums. Your phone—whose wallpaper has corrected itself—rests heavy in your pocket, asleep. The bulbs glow. The wind rehearses names and gets yours right on the first try.

When you finally look for your friend again, they are exactly where you left them. You don’t have to move. The dream, relieved, remembers its own shape and holds.
