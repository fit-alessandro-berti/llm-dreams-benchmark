You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language you've never seen—glowing runes that shift and swirl like living smoke on the page. Panic rises as you realize the proctor is your childhood pet goldfish, now inexplicably human-sized and wearing a tweed jacket, staring at you with unblinking eyes.

"Time's ticking, dreamer," it gurgles in a voice like bubbling gravel. You scribble nonsense answers, but the runes reform into your deepest fears: unpaid bills morphing into dancing skeletons, forgotten birthdays as exploding cakes, and a giant version of your high school crush laughing at your awkward teenage poetry.

Suddenly, the exam paper sprouts wings—literal butterfly wings—and flutters out the window into a sky that's turned to molten caramel. You chase it through clouds of cotton candy, leaping over rainbow bridges guarded by talking squirrels demanding riddles. "What has keys but opens no doors?" one squeaks. You shout "A piano!" and they part like the Red Sea.

The paper lands in a vast library where books whisper secrets of the universe. You grab it, only to find the questions have transformed: "Why do you dream?" "What if failure is just the plot twist?" You ace them all with heart-pounding truths, and the goldfish proctor applauds, awarding you a diploma made of stardust.

You wake up clutching your pillow, strangely at peace, ready for whatever "final exam" life throws next. Sweet dreams... or was it all too real? 😴
