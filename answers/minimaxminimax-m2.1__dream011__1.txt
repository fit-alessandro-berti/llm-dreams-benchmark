# The Final Exam

You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are written in a language you don't recognize—elegant, flowing symbols that shift when you try to focus on them directly. The proctor, a kind-faced woman with silver-streaked hair, smiles reassuringly and hands you a fountain pen that feels impossibly heavy in your hand.

The clock on the wall ticks backwards.

You flip to the first page and discover that while you cannot read the questions, you somehow understand them. The first asks you to describe the moment you first felt truly afraid—not of danger, but of your own potential. The second requests that you draw a map of a place you've never been but somehow know by heart. The third is simply: *What are you willing to sacrifice?*

As you begin to write, the other students around you fade away, and you realize you are alone in a vast hall with a ceiling of stars, even though you can still hear the scratch of distant pencils and the occasional cough.

The pen moves on its own sometimes, filling pages with thoughts you didn't know you had—memories you thought you'd forgotten, confessions you've been afraid to make. Questions about your past choices swirl together with visions of roads not taken.

A door at the back of the hall opens quietly, spilling warm golden light into the room. Through it, you glimpse a version of yourself that looks remarkably like who you hoped to become—calm, certain, at peace. This version watches you write with gentle patience, neither encouraging nor discouraging, simply bearing witness.

You could walk through that door at any time. But the exam isn't finished yet, and something in you wants to see what answers will emerge from the ink, what truth might surface before the clock runs out.

The symbols on the page begin to glow faintly, and you understand that this was never really about getting the answers right. It was about asking yourself the questions you've avoided—and finally, mercifully, beginning to answer them.
