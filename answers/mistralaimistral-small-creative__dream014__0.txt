**Dream Continuation:**

You hesitate for a moment, your heart pounding—part of you wants to trust them, but the city’s noise and the weight of your loneliness make you wary. The strangers don’t rush you. One of them, an older woman with warm, crinkled eyes, steps forward and gently places a small, smooth stone in your palm. *"This will guide you,"* she says. *"But first, you have to tell us what you’re really looking for."*

You stare at the stone—it’s cool and heavy, etched with faint, swirling lines that seem to shift when you blink. The others nod encouragingly, their faces a mix of curiosity and quiet understanding. A young man with a scarf wrapped loosely around his neck grins. *"We’ve all been lost here before. The city doesn’t let go easily, but neither do we."*

You take a deep breath and realize: you don’t actually know *where* you’re going. You’re not lost in the streets—you’re lost in yourself. The words spill out before you can stop them: *"I don’t know who I’m supposed to be. I keep changing, and nothing feels like mine anymore."*

The group exchanges glances, and the older woman smiles. *"Ah. Then you’re not lost—you’re *unfolding*."* She points to the stone in your hand. *"That’s the key. But you have to walk to find out what it opens."*

One by one, they each take your hand and press something into it—a feather, a matchstick, a single silver coin. *"For courage,"* the young man says. *"For light,"* murmurs a girl with braids. *"For luck,"* adds a quiet voice from the back. The last stranger, a tall figure in a long coat, simply places a folded origami crane in your palm and whispers, *"For the part of you that’s still learning to fly."*

The city around you begins to shift. The neon signs flicker like fireflies, the crowds part like a river, and the stone in your hand grows warm. The strangers step back, their forms dissolving into the glow of the streetlights, but their voices linger: *"Keep walking. The door is always closer than you think."*

You take a step—and the pavement beneath you *tilts*. The buildings stretch upward, their windows blinking like eyes, and the stone in your hand pulses with a soft, golden light. Ahead of you, a narrow alleyway appears where there was none before, its walls lined with doors of every shape and color. Some are ajar, revealing glimpses of other lives: a library where books float like birds, a kitchen where a child laughs over a steaming pot, a garden where flowers hum lullabies.

You realize, with a rush of wonder, that the stone isn’t a key—*you* are. The doors aren’t locked; they’re waiting. And for the first time, you’re not afraid to choose.

**How does the dream end for you?** (Do you pick a door? Does the city speak to you? Or does something else happen?)
