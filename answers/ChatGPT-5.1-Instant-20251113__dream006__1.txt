…speak, but the words that leave your mouth aren’t the ones you expected. They float out like glowing ribbons, drifting upward and curling into shapes above the stage. The audience gasps—not in fear, but in awe—as the ribbons twist themselves into birds made of light.

The birds circle your head, waiting.

You try again, this time choosing your words carefully. As you speak, each sentence becomes a different creature: a fox made of warm amber, a whale that swims through the air as though it were water, a tiny constellation that hovers above your outstretched hand. The audience leans forward, mesmerized, as if each creature is a secret only you can reveal.

Then, something shifts. From the back of the auditorium, a soft wind begins to blow, though there are no windows. The wind gathers your glowing creatures and pulls them toward a single point above the crowd. They merge, slowly, forming a doorway suspended in the air—its edges shimmering with every color you’ve spoken.

The audience turns to you, silently asking what comes next.

You take a breath, feel the stage warm beneath your feet, and walk toward the doorway of light.

As you cross the threshold, the dream shifts once more, and you…
