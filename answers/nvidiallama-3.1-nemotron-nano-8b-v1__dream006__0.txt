Here's a dream speech that starts with the "crowd looking expectantly" scenario:  

**"As I stepped onto the stage, the crowd's faces lit up like twin lanterns of moonlight—demanding Something Great. I couldn't help but notice one face that stood out—*and it wasn't just the usual human nose*.*It was a nose.* And it wasn't just holding my hat! It seemed to emit a flicker of inspiration, like a tiny guide light to guide me onto the hilarious puzzle of expectations."**

### Opening.. and What?
The audience's collective *eyes* were glued to mine. Only a tiny nose seemed poised to escalate the situation.

### The Unlikely Expert Movement
"Attention, prospective auditors! Your implied "Something Amazing" is known toYou, but it's possible I don't even know what I'm delivering. What do you think this nose is trying to play dragon role-playing? Maybe it's quickly dispatching a serendipitous anecdote to your inner critic or to your tech support team (as in, they are about to restart their 00:00-minute display!)—but hey, i swear it isn't reckless! I've been dieting recently, and it's all about the type of punch."

**[Robots Emote Hmmm...**] Barbie looks back towards the crowd, startled by the dimly flickering 'nose' that now seems to dance like an annoying alarm signal.**

---

What ViewModel, oh Expectant Crowd!
 Dive deeper into my thoughts, but just to confirm that 'Something Amazing' is already in motion.  

---

[**Deliberate pause (a deliberate spouse-like gestures) to emphasize the madness.]**  
"I've got many stories left. But I promise—of a subject that won't just sit in my chair. You might as well count on polite applause, but I won't guarantee anything but a robotic violin solo or at least the removal of this bizarre nose-prow specimen from our well-intentioned stage."  

---

---

"Long story short: I learned to model the unmet expectations of people, including those of enthusiastic audiences."  

---

---

[**Suddenly, the 'nose' flickerers, then extinguishes.** The room falls silent. The crowd exchanges bewildered glances.]  

---

We're all here, for the proverb/etics of expectation's intrusion. But stay tuned for a possible return performance, when my 'Something Bizarre' determines what!"

But let's see where this goes. The unexpected nose adds a touch of the absurd and unpredictable, setting up a narrative that quickly shifts from the absurd to a more performative tone. The key is to start with the crowd's anticipation and then find a clever twist to make the audience laugh, engage them, and bring the repetition of "Something Amazing" humorously to the forefront. This opening line sets the foundation for a dream speech that blends humor with anticipation.

**Tips for Continuation:**
1. **Carry the Irony:** Keep the effects of the "nose" and the expectations alive, as a recurring paradox.
2. **Engage the Crowd Directly:** Ask them questions or invite them to imagine their own dream speeches—that creates interaction.
3. **Play with Expectations:** Highlight the mismatch between the crowd's anticipation and the practicalities of speech, blending humor with a bit of remark about audience psychology.
4. **Change the Story Mid-Speech:** Serve up a fantastic second act to keep the audience guessing. 

This blueprint ensures the narrative stays both funny and engaging, drawing the audience into the "dream" dimension from the very start.
