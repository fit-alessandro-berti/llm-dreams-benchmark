**Dream Continuation:**

As you sit down, the exam paper unfurls like an ancient scroll, revealing questions that defy logic. The first line reads: *"Calculate the weight of your ambitions. Show your work."* Your pen hovers, ink trembling, as numbers morph into hieroglyphs. The next question shifts before your eyes: *"Map the moment your childhood died. Use coordinates."* 

A chill snakes down your spine. The third question isn’t text at all—it’s a looping video of your parents arguing, muted, with the prompt: *"Edit this memory to achieve a passing grade."* The clock on the wall accelerates, its hands spinning like a berserk windmill. 

Panicked, you glance around. Other students scribble furiously, but their papers are blank. The professor materializes as your kindergarten teacher, eyes void of pupils, chanting, *"Time’s up, time’s up,"* in a voice that echoes from the walls. 

You jolt awake, sheets tangled, heart drumming. The clock reads 3:07 a.m. Dawn is hours away, but sleep won’t return. The weight of amorphous expectations lingers, like a syllabus written in smoke.
