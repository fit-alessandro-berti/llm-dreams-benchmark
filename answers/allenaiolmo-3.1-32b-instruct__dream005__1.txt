navigate through a maze of unfamiliar faces and laughter. The room feels bigger than it should, echoing with snippets of conversation and the soft clink of glasses. You weave between clusters of friends, hoping to spot a familiar smile, but everyone seems deeply engrossed in their own worlds.

Suddenly, you catch a glimpse of that one person you know at the far end of the room, standing by a window, looking out with a distant expression. As you approach, the crowd parts slightly, and the ambient noise seems to fade into the background. You call out their name, and they turn, their face lighting up with recognition and relief.

Together, you step out onto a balcony overlooking the night sky, the cool air brushing against your skin. In the quiet between you, there’s a sense of comfort and connection, as if the vastness of the gathering suddenly doesn’t matter anymore. The city lights twinkle below, and for a moment, it’s just the two of you, sharing the stillness and the dream.
