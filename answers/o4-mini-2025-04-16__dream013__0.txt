You push open a heavy iron door and step into a long corridor whose walls ripple like liquid glass. Symbols you haven’t seen before float just beyond reach, twisting into new shapes every time you blink. Ahead, a pedestal holds an orb of pale blue light. Etched around its base is your own name—though you’ve never seen it written like this before.

As you lift the orb, the corridor shifts: the floor becomes a mosaic of letters and numbers, each square a mini‑puzzle. One wrong step spins the tiles beneath you, and you must solve the riddle on each tile to proceed:
• “I speak without a mouth…”  
• “What has keys but can’t open locks?”  
Your heart beats faster. You rearrange the tiles to spell the answers, and with every correct solution, the walls glow a little brighter.

At the corridor’s end, an archway opens onto a vast chamber whose ceiling disappears into darkness. In the center stands a chessboard carved from obsidian, pieces mid‑game. A disembodied voice whispers: “Checkmate awaits when you uncover the truth you hide.” You realize each puzzle wasn’t just logic—it was memory, fear, hope. The final move isn’t a knight’s gambit but a choice: to face what’s buried in your own mind or turn back toward waking.

You place the orb on the board’s last square. The pieces shatter into stardust, the ceiling floods with dawn light—and you awaken, the echo of that voice still ringing in your mind.
