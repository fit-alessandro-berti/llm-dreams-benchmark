You are dreaming. The rain feels thick on my skin, clinging and resisting. Each brick in the maze glows an iridescent purple, pulsing with a low thrum that vibrates in your bones. I’m wading through rivers of melted honey, each swirl reflecting distorted versions of the puzzle walls – interlocking geometric shapes overlaid with ancient, indecipherable symbols. The air is tasting of cinnamon and metal. 

As you’re moving deeper, a faint melody, mournful and echoing, seems to seep from the maze walls themselves. The puzzles aren't just challenging, they are *remembering*. Each one whispers a forgotten truth, fragments of memory that dance and shift with your thoughts. 

I start noticing details I didn’t see before - tiny, perfectly formed snowflakes trapped within the walls, miniature replicas of faces observing the progress of my struggle. Each solved puzzle isn't just an obstacle; it's a ripple in a vast, echoing consciousness. 

Below me, a gigantic grandfather clock spins endlessly. Its face isn't ticking; it's displaying a continuous, fragmented sequence of numbers. And as I approach it, a single note – clear and sharp – pierces through the silence and begins to repeat itself – “7… 3… 6… 2…  4… 5.”

My hands are moving instinctively, guided by a feeling I don’t understand, responding to the note. I feel like a key falling into place with a lock, unlocking a dormant part of myself. Each step brings a deepening, unsettling sensation – as if I’m slowly becoming less and less… me. 

Suddenly, a single piece of puzzle materializes beneath my feet – a tarnished silver scale, intricately carved with a constellation. As I pick it up, the maze walls seem to shift slightly, correcting themselves. A new puzzle appears, smaller than the ones I'd been facing before, depicting a simple box. 

But as I reach towards it, a voice – not audible but *felt* - whispers, "The pattern shifts if you look differently."  It’s within the silver scale itself, shimmering like trapped water. I hesitate just for a fleeting moment before tilting the scale, and the entire maze dissolves into a kaleidoscope of colors, a single, stark white wall. I am standing in a completely empty room. 


...  And I'm profoundly, undeniably, sad. The rain has stopped, but the color seems to drain out of the world.

**What happens?** (You, the dreamer, have a choice of how to respond. Do you: A) Keep continuing onwards?  B) Try to understand what’s happening?  C) Walk out of the room and try to solve the next puzzle? Choose A, B or C.)
