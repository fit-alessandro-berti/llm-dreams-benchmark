—you hear the wind churn through the leaves, turning their green sides silver. The air sharpens, charged with the scent of rain and distant lightning. Heavy clouds gather overhead, swallowing the golden sunlight and casting everything in a dusky, flickering gray.

You quicken your pace along the mossy path, feeling the soft earth shift beneath your feet, when a sudden gust scatters petals and twigs across your path. In the hush before the rain, you spot a strange faint light ahead, like the flicker of a lantern even though you are deep in the woods.

As the first drops fall, cold and bright, you step towards this glow. Between the old trees, you find a clearing with a small wooden shelter you’re sure wasn’t there before. Inside, a gentle warmth invites you—a fire crackles in a stone hearth and a steaming cup sits waiting on a rough-hewn table, as if someone expected you.

Outside, thunder rumbles like a distant drum, but in this place you feel safe, surrounded by the mysterious comfort only dreams can conjure. As you sit by the fire, the storm becomes music, and your thoughts float between memory and hope, carried through the dream-forest by the gentle, drumming rain.
