written in a language you’ve never seen before—fluid, shimmering symbols that seem to shift like liquid mercury when you try to focus on them. The paper itself feels strangely warm, almost alive, as if the ink is pulsing faintly beneath your fingertips.

A whisper slithers through the room, though no one else appears to be speaking. *"The test isn’t about what you know… but what you’re willing to unlearn."* The proctor—a faceless figure in a robe that ripples like smoke—doesn’t react. The clock on the wall begins ticking backward.

The first question reads (or *feels* like it reads):
**"Describe the color of the sky in a world where light has never been measured."**

Your pencil hovers. The air smells faintly of ozone and something older, like damp stone and crushed violets. The student next to you is scribbling furiously, but their answers are dissolving into the page as they write, leaving behind only faint, glowing fingerprints.

Then you notice the fine print at the bottom of the exam:
*"This test is also grading you on how quietly you can panic."*

**How do you proceed?** (Choose or invent your response:)
1. **Close your eyes and press your palm to the page**, trusting that the answer will emerge from the contact—like a Rorschach test between you and the unknown.
2. **Whisper the first nonsense word that comes to mind** and watch as the symbols rearrange themselves in response, revealing a hidden pattern.
3. **Stand up and walk to the window**, where the glass is now a swirling portal showing glimpses of possible futures—each pane a different career path, some glowing, some cracked.
4. **Laugh and flip the exam over**, only to find your own handwriting on the back: a letter from your future self, dated *tomorrow*, with the words: *"Stop trying to solve it. The question is the answer."*
5. **[Your own surreal action here.]**
