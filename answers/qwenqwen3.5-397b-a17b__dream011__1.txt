...written in a handwriting that matches my own, but the words are questions I don't remember asking. *"Where did you leave the key?" "Why is the ocean heavy?" "Who were you before you woke up?"*

I look down at my pen, but it's gone. In its place is a white feather. The classroom around me begins to dissolve at the edges, the walls peeling away like old wallpaper to reveal a starry night sky. The other students are no longer people; they are mannequins made of clockwork, ticking in unison.

I realize then that if I answer, I wake up. If I stay silent, I stay here. The proctor walks down the aisle, but they have no face, only a mirror where their features should be. In the reflection, I see myself, but I'm wearing clothes I haven't owned since I was ten.

The clock on the wall starts running backward. The ink on my page begins to crawl back into the nib of a pen that has suddenly reappeared in my hand. I understand the task now. It isn't to answer the questions. It's to forgive myself for not knowing the answers.

I put the pen down. The paper turns blindingly white. The room vanishes. And I fall upward, into the light.
