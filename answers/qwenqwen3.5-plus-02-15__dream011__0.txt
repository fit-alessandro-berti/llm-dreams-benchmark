You are about to take the final exam for a course that determines your future career. As you sit down to start the exam, you notice the questions are **written in a language that doesn't exist, composed entirely of shifting symbols that look like constellations melting into ink.**

You blink, hoping your eyes are playing tricks on you, but the page ripples like the surface of a pond disturbed by a stone. The proctor, a figure whose face keeps changing between people you've met in your life, clears their throat. "Begin," they say, but their voice sounds like it's coming from underwater.

Panic flares in your chest. You reach for your pen, but when you touch it, it turns into a dandelion stem. You try to write anyway, expecting nonsense, but as the soft white seeds drift onto the paper, they arrange themselves into perfect answers. The more you blow on the pen, the faster the answers appear, filling the page with glowing silver text.

Suddenly, the walls of the examination hall dissolve. You aren't in a classroom anymore; you are sitting on a cloud overlooking a city made of clockwork and light. The exam booklet floats up, transforming into a map. You realize with a jolt that there were never any wrong answers—the test wasn't about what you knew, but about how you would react when the rules of reality broke down.

The proctor smiles, now looking exactly like your future self. "You passed," they say. "You learned to create your own path when the old ones disappeared."

As you stand up, the cloud beneath you lifts, carrying you toward the horizon where your new career—whatever form it takes—is waiting to begin. Then, just as you reach out to touch the sun, the world fades into white, and you wake up.
