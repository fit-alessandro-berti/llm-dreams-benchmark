(I step outside into the dense underbrush of a clearing) Ah no, that's not right... I'm floating there now and looking out at a sea of darkness. Can you help me get back to my ordinary world? My name is Emilia, and I have always been plagued by nightmares; often, they come with dire consequences for me or others around me.

At least that can't be the weather changing right here...
