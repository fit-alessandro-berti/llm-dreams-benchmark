—realize your computer has disappeared. In its place is a strange, humming box made of glass and light that you somehow know you’re supposed to use. As your boss taps their foot impatiently, you try pressing its sides and suddenly, the entire office dissolves into a kaleidoscope of colors.

When the world settles again, you’re still in your office chair, but now it’s balancing on the edge of a giant fountain at the center of a gleaming city plaza. You look around; your coworkers are floating by, tethered to balloons in the shape of clocks, some waving reassuringly. Your boss hands you a golden quill and a piece of paper that’s forever rolling, like a conveyor belt.

“Go on,” they say, smiling now. “You have all the time you need—if you can catch it.”

As you reach for the paper, the chair tips but never falls, and you start to write, words trailing off into the air and becoming birds that wing away toward a shimmering sun. In the distance, you hear gentle applause, and coffee begins to rain from the sky, filling your mug with the perfect brew.
