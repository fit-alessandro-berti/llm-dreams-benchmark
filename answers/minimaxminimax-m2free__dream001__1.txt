You have exactly sixty minutes, so the city has to help you on purpose. The buildings tilt just enough to feel like they’re listening, and the neon signs hum like breath. A paper boy with a blue coat darts past and presses a folded note into your hand: inside, only a compass rose with one line glowing east.

You run east, sneakers slapping wet pavement. Streetcars cough by with brass bells; the canal mirrors a sky that hasn’t fully arrived. A vendor selling jasmine tea hands you a fortune cookie that won’t open. “Find the tall echo,” she says, and the girl on the bench across from her nods toward a bridge that goes nowhere until it goes everywhere.

You cross the bridge, and the city breathes: pigeons lift like a storm of soft pages, and every storefront flashes with little fortunes that never quite match. A bookshop opens its door to a forest of shelves; a bakery exhales cinnamon and fear; a music store plays a song that seems to remember your name from years ago. You could stay forever. You move.

At the center, a clock tower spires up, the minute hand frozen just shy of twelve, as if time is deciding. Under it, a narrow spiral staircase rises and never ends. Your pulse becomes the step, and the city keeps breathing with you. When you finally push open the door at the top, the room has no walls—only a view that changes its mind every time you blink.

They’re waiting. Not many people, just several versions of you from later and earlier days, all wearing the same slightly awkward smile. A dossier sits on a floating desk made of stormlight, pages turning in a gentle wind. Agenda:

- Time
- Distance
- Identity

“The meeting,” says one of you, the one who kept the first jacket, “is usually about forgiving the self you keep losing.”

You sit. The room is a sound of yes-and. You talk about that hour, and how every minute on the walk tried to be both a question and an answer. You talk about the paper boy, the canal, the clock’s hunger for midnight. You confess the places where the city tried to keep you: the bakery’s warm air, the bookstore forest, the bridge that wanted to be a secret. You ask for a path that doesn’t vanish when you look away. You ask to meet yourself somewhere quieter, somewhere your breath won’t get caught.

They nod. It’s decided:

You will learn to carry your meeting with you.

- When the city asks for directions, you’ll trust the one thing you can’t fake: the way your body lightens when you’re close to what you need.
- When a clock refuses, you will make time out of your own attention, not out of fear.
- When the paper boy appears again (and he will), you’ll listen to the taste of his words, not just their sound.

They hand you a cup that never empties and a map that only shows where you’re not yet. The door opens to stairs made of weather; you step down, and the city follows like a low, friendly tide.

You know the way now. It’s east, toward whatever makes your shoulders forget being afraid. It’s inside you, unfolded like the fortune cookie, and still to be read.

Where do you go next?
