You start to wander the labyrinthine streets, where skyscrapers twist like melting candles and sidewalks pulse with the faint glow of bioluminescent vines creeping up from the cracks. The air hums with a distant symphony of chattering birds that sound suspiciously like stockbrokers haggling over invisible deals. Your phone—wait, do you even have one?—buzzes in your pocket, but when you pull it out, the screen displays a map of your own veins, pulsing red with urgency.

Panic bubbles up, sweet as champagne, and you hail a cab that's actually a giant, iridescent beetle with antennae that double as turn signals. "The meeting!" you shout to the driver, a shadowy figure in a top hat made of swirling fog. "Wherever it is—now!" The beetle skitters forward, dodging flocks of paper airplanes that fold themselves into origami cranes mid-flight, each one whispering directions in a language of forgotten passwords.

Suddenly, the city folds inward like a pop-up book, and you're spat out onto the rooftop of a glass cathedral, where the boardroom table is a vast, reflective pond rippling with schools of golden fish nibbling at floating contracts. Your colleagues aren't people but elegant swans in tailored suits, their necks arching gracefully as they quack through quarterly reports. You're late—eternally, impossibly late—and as you dive in to sign the deal with a quill fashioned from your own eyelash, the water turns to ink, pulling you under.

You thrash, gasping, but it's exhilarating, this drowning in deadlines. The swans applaud with webbed wings, and just as the ink fills your lungs with the taste of unfinished sentences, a voice echoes from the depths: "Wake up. It's only Monday."

Your eyes flutter open to the familiar ceiling fan, spinning lazily like a lazy apology. The alarm clock blinks 7:00 AM, and for a split second, you swear you hear swan laughter fading into the hum of traffic outside. Another day in the city—real this time, or is it?
