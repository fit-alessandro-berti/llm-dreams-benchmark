You wake to the scent of river reeds and burning cow dung—not the sterile tang of your apartment’s air purifier, but something older, earthier, wilder. Cold mud presses against your cheek. When you open your eyes, the sky is a washed-out blue, streaked with smoke from a distant fire, and the sounds around you are a symphony of shouted words in a language you don’t know—crisp, melodic, almost like a lullaby sung over grinding stone. No cars, no phones, no hum of electricity—just dirt paths winding between sun-baked mudbrick houses, children’s laughter echoing off mud walls, and the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of women pounding grain in a courtyard.  

You’re wearing your own clothes: the same worn sneakers, the faded gray hoodie. But your feet ache in them. Bare feet would be normal here. As you stand, the weight of time hits you like a physical blow. You stumbled into a market square—creaming vaseline-scented clay pots,bundles of dried fish, a fat white cat napping on a spice sack—and realized with a jolt: *You need to find your name.*  

Because when you touch the rough wood of a stall, a memory flashes—*not yours*. A child’s hand spelling *Dharani* in the dust with a stick. A woman braiding your hair with marigolds. A song humming in your throat that has no words, only the cadence of the Indus River. The air smells of wet clay and *your* hands. You reach into your hoodie pocket, expecting your phone, but your fingers close around something cold and smooth: a fluted object carved from elephant tusk. It’s a flute. But the carvings on it aren’t ancient Indus symbols—they’re *modern geometric patterns*. Art from your own timeline. Yet you know—*instinctively*—that you made this.  

Your breath catches. The town isn’t a distant past. It’s *yours*. Not just visited, but *built*. And the dream isn’t about escaping this era—it’s about remembering why you left it.  

*You need to play the flute.* Only then will the river remember your name.
