a blank canvas hovering in mid-air, its edges fraying like smoke from a forgotten cigarette. The canvas pulses faintly, as if breathing in sync with the shifting hues of the sky—now a bruised lavender, now a riot of molten gold veined with electric blue.

You reach out, your fingers tingling with the residue of the last shape you touched (a cube that whispered secrets in reverse), and the moment your skin brushes the surface, it yields like warm wax. Colors bleed from your touch: a swirl of emerald envy from your thumb, crimson curiosity from your palm. The canvas drinks them in, then exhales—a living mural unfurling before you.

First, a forest sprouts at the center, trees with leaves of shattered glass that chime like wind bells in a breeze you can't feel. Birds with wings of folded newspaper take flight, their headlines screaming tomorrow's regrets in languages you've never learned. Then, the ground beneath the canvas warps, and you're falling upward into it, tumbling through layers of memory-paint: a childhood swing set rendered in sepia nostalgia, a lover's laugh as a comet trail of sparkling confetti.

Deeper in, the canvas reveals its heart—a mirror-pool reflecting not your face, but the face of the world you left behind, distorted and dancing. It asks, in a voice like rustling silk, "What shape shall we dream next?" Your hand hovers, paint-dripping, and the choice hangs there, infinite, until the colors decide for you: a door, arched and ajar, leading to a library where books grow on vines and pages turn themselves into butterflies.

You step through, the canvas folding behind you like origami wings, and the dream ripples onward, chasing its own tail into the dawn. What happens when you wake? That's for tomorrow's colors to decide.
