frantically explore the winding streets, feeling a mixture of anxiety and curiosity. The buildings are towering and strange, draped in glowing lights and unusual signs that seem to shift and shimmer as you pass by. You pull out a crumpled piece of paper with an address, but the language on it is unfamiliar, and the map on your phone flickers uncertainly.

Suddenly, a friendly-looking stranger approaches, noticing your puzzled expression. They speak with a gentle, calming voice and gesture toward a nearby subway station. You realize that in this unfamiliar city, the best way to find your destination might be through asking locals or trusting your instincts. With a deep breath, you decide to follow the stranger’s advice, heading towards the station, hoping you'll find your way to the meeting in time—though a part of you marvels at the surreal beauty of this strange, dreamscape city.
