You are given a mysterious locked box with no key in sight. As you examine it closely, you notice intricate patterns and symbols etched into its polished brass surface—swirling constellations that seem to pulse faintly, as if alive. Your fingers trace the engravings, and suddenly, the box begins to hum, vibrating gently in your hands. The air around it shimmers with heat, distorting your vision like a desert mirage.

Without warning, the patterns shift, rearranging into words that weren't there before: *Dreamer, what lies within is your unguarded truth.* Curiosity overrides caution; you press your palm against the lock, and it clicks open effortlessly as if it had been waiting for you alone. Inside, instead of gold or jewels, there's a swirling vortex of mist—vapors that whisper secrets from your past, pulling you in like a lover's embrace.

You step forward, and the world fades to dreamless white. When you awaken, the box is gone, but a faint echo lingers: the symbols have etched themselves onto your skin, glowing softly in the dark, urging you to unlock the next layer of yourself. Or was it all just a fevered vision? You reach for your pen to jot it down, but then the symbols flare up again—now on your notebook page, spelling out your name in an alphabet you can't decode. The circle tightens; there's no escaping what you've begun.
