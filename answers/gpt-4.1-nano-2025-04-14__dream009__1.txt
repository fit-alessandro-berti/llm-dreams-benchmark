find shelter and gather resources to survive. The landscape is vast—rolling hills, dense forests, and a small village in the distance. As you walk toward the village, you notice villagers going about their daily routines, dressed in simple, old-fashioned clothing. You sense that understanding the language and customs is crucial.

To do that, you decide to:

- Find a local to ask for guidance or help
- Observe their behaviors to learn their ways
- Identify natural resources like edible plants or water sources nearby to sustain yourself

Your immediate priority is to blend in, stay safe, and figure out how to navigate this unfamiliar world.
