you start to see the silhouettes of towering trees bow under the weight of the gathering clouds. The air thickens, scents of moss and damp leaves intensifying as the wind begins to stir. You notice a peculiar hush settling over the forest—no birds singing, no rustling of small creatures. Every branch, every needle, every patch of leafy ground seems suspended in an uneasy expectation.

Before long, the canopy darkens, as if ink were spilling across the sky. The path you’ve been walking, a gentle ribbon of earth, starts to look less friendly, the roots twisting up as though to trip you. You taste the metallic tinge of ozone on the back of your tongue. Thick drops of rain begin to fall, erratic at first, then more insistent, drumming the foliage in a rising tattoo of sound.

Lightning illuminates the trunks of the pines for an instant, revealing something strange ahead. Through the flicker of electric blue, you think you catch a glimpse of a wooden structure nestled between two giant oaks—a modest cabin, its windows dark, but its shape unmistakable. The thunder follows moments later, rumbling through the marrow of your bones, and you realize there are no better options: you must seek shelter.

You make your way toward the cabin, boots sinking into the spongy leaf litter, shoulders hunched against the rain. As you approach, you notice the door stands slightly ajar. You hesitantly push it open and step inside. The scent of old wood and herbs greets you. Your eyes adjust slowly to the dim light, helped only by the occasional lightning flash leaking through a small, dusty window.

The single room is spare: a table in the center, a chair overturned beside it, and shelves lining the walls filled with jars and books. On the table lies an open journal, its pages yellowed and curling at the edges. You pick it up, curiosity pulling you forward. The handwriting inside is old-fashioned and hurried. You skim the lines, your pulse quickening as you realize they speak of this very forest, of storms like this one, and of someone—a traveler—seeking refuge in this very cabin during nights of turmoil.

A particularly loud crash of thunder makes you jump, and the door slams shut behind you. You notice now something else: a figure sitting in the far corner, its outline barely discernible in the gloom. A low whisper reaches your ears, or perhaps it’s only the wind. You inhale sharply, heart hammering in your chest. The figure stirs, and a flash of lightning reveals a face—it’s kind, lined with age, and watchful, like a caretaker who has seen many pass through these woods before. “I was waiting,” the figure says softly, voice steady despite the storm’s rage outside. “The forest warned me you would come.”

You stand there, drenched and uncertain, holding the journal to your chest. The rain beats against the small window, and the storm continues to shout its presence in the night sky. Yet, in this quiet, humble space, something about the stranger’s calm demeanor and the strange familiarity of these surroundings kindles an unexpected warmth in your heart. You realize that the dream is more than a story—it’s an invitation. You have stumbled into a place where time blurs, where the forest’s memory dwells, and where perhaps your own truths wait to be discovered.

And as the wind roars outside and the lightning crackles across the sky, you find yourself stepping deeper into this shared silence, prepared to learn whatever secrets the storm and the old stranger have to offer.
