…take a breath before the next word can spring from your mouth. The air between you hums like a struck wire, and for a moment the room—somewhere half-remembered, wallpaper curling like old photographs—seems to lean in, eavesdropping.

“Let me try again,” you say, palms open. Your friend mirrors you, then crosses their arms, then uncrosses them, as if their body can’t decide how to hold the weight of this.

“It matters to me because it’s tied to who I think I am,” you add, surprising yourself with the sincerity. The words tumble out like coins you’ve been saving.

They tilt their head. “And it matters to me because I don’t want to disappear.”

When they say that, the floor becomes a lake. The rug liquefies, and your shoes darken, wicking up cold like a creeping thought. You both wobble but don’t sink. You realize this is the part of the dream where metaphors stop pretending—where water is not water but the sensation of needing to keep something afloat.

“Okay,” you say, and your voice skips over the surface like a stone. “Then neither of us disappears. We just… make room.”

“How?” they ask, and their question makes a small whirlpool.

You look around for something to offer, and the room obliges: shelves rise from the lake stacked with arguments, each labeled in your handwriting. Should. Fair. Always. Never. You pick one up, read it to yourself, and feel it dissolve, paper turning to ripples. You pick another, and it does the same. Your friend laughs softly, and in the laugh is the child you met on a playground, the teenager you sat up with on cold nights, the adult who sees you when you forget to see yourself.

“We can set terms,” you say, feeling suddenly like you’ve done this before. “You tell me the part that’s nonnegotiable. I’ll tell you mine. We braid from there.”

They nod, and the lake becomes shallower. You both sit on the edge of a couch that was not here a moment ago, dripping but warmer now, as if the argument also needed a place to sit.

“My nonnegotiable,” they say, looking at their hands, “is that you don’t make my fears into a punchline.”

You flinch, then nod. “My nonnegotiable is that I’m allowed to want what I want without being told it makes me selfish.”

Somewhere, a clock coughs up a handful of seconds and then falls quiet. The window shows a street you’ve never walked down but somehow remember perfectly: a dog tethered to a lamppost, a woman balancing two coffees, a bus that’s always just leaving.

“I’m sorry,” you say. It lands like a stone too, but this one sinks in a good way, making a soft thud on the bottom. “I make jokes when I’m cornered.”

“I sharpen when I’m scared,” they admit. “It cuts things that don’t deserve it.”

Between you, a small boat drifts into being, the size of a shoe box, carved with little notches for every time you’ve survived something together. It fills, not with water, but with options. Speak softer. Ask first. Time-out. Return later. Hold hands. Write it down. Let silence be a sentence.

“Pick one,” your friend says.

You reach out. Your hand passes through Speak softer as if it’s fog, lands on Ask first, and solidifies. It feels like the right weight. Your friend takes Hold hands and laughs because it’s both corny and true. You touch knees. Electricity cracks the surface of the world in a not-unpleasant way.

Then the walls begin to blur, the room’s edges smudging like wet chalk. You know what this means, and you both look toward the door that was never there and is now too bright to be a door. You don’t want to lose the thread.

“Before we wake up,” you say, “say one sentence I can carry.”

They consider you the way you’ve always wanted to be considered: as if your face is a map and they’re patient with detours. “You don’t have to be right to be loved,” they say. “And neither do I.”

You release a breath you didn’t know you were holding. “I’ll write it on the fridge,” you promise, and the dream approves: a magnet clacks onto a gleaming surface that floats just above the lake that is now a rug again. The magnet is shaped like a tiny lighthouse. Its beam cuts through the last of the blur.

When the bright door opens, it smells like morning. You stand, lighter than when you sat, as if some argument has been set down, not won. You and your friend walk toward the light together, nudging the little boat with your toes. It follows, dutiful as a pet, carrying your new terms like two small lanterns. And as you cross the threshold, you feel the world flip—just a little—as if to say: next time, remember the boat. Remember the hands. Remember that this is how you decide to stay.
