As I sit here, the city hums around me—streets shimmer with reflections, and the skies above flicker with the soft glow of distant lights. I feel adrift, not body-shaken but truly spiritually unmoored. The strangers arrive without a word, their voices a gentle tapestry of encouragement. They each offer something different: a faded map tucked into one hand, a whispered phrase in a language I don't yet understand, a small mirror that reflects a version of me I’ve forgotten.

One of them holds up a broken compass, its needle spinning wildly, but it points in a direction that feels just right. Another carries a paper crane, fragile but trembling, as if it too is trying to find its way. As we walk together, the streets shift subtly, leading us past buildings that seem to take on different shapes depending on how you look at them.

We arrive at a square where the air tastes like elderflower and truth. There’s no sign, no hotel, no place to stay—but there’s a garden waiting. A garden growing not flowers, but stories. Each bloom represents a memory, a choice, a moment of courage or hesitation. I wander among them, and with every bloom, I remember something about who I was, what I left behind, and what I might become.

Eventually, we find a path that leads not to a destination, but to reflection. The dream shifts again, this time inviting me to listen—not just to the world around me, but to the quiet voice inside that has been speaking all along.

You are not lost. You are simply in the process of becoming.
