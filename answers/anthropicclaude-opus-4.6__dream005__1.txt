# The Dream

You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and...

...each group seems to shift and rearrange just as you approach, the way things do in dreams — faces half-familiar, half-wrong, like portraits painted from imperfect memory.

The first group is laughing around a table that's too long, stretching back into a hallway that shouldn't exist. One of them turns to you and says, "We've been waiting for you," but when you ask if they've seen your friend, their smile stays frozen and they tilt their head as if the question were in a language they've never heard. You move on.

You push through a doorway into a kitchen that opens into a garden. A circle of people is debating something passionately — the ethics of staircases, perhaps, or the migration patterns of cathedral bells. One of them grabs your arm. "You agree with me, don't you?" she insists. Her eyes are the color of an emotion you can't name. You mumble something and pull away.

The rooms keep multiplying. A ballroom with no music. A library where people whisper into books instead of reading them. A balcony overlooking a city you've never visited but somehow recognize.

Then — there — across a crowded room that smells of rain and candle wax, you catch a glimpse. *Your person.* They're standing near a window, and they're the only figure in the entire dream who isn't slightly blurred at the edges. Sharp. Real. An anchor.

You start toward them, but the floor softens beneath your feet like wet sand. The crowd thickens. People keep stepping into your path, offering you drinks that change color in the glass, asking your name and then answering it themselves — always wrong.

You call out. Your voice comes out velvet-thick and slow, the way dream-voices do.

But your person turns. They see you. And they smile — not the frozen smiles of the others, but something warm and specific and *yours* — and the crowd between you parts like a breath being released.

And just as your hand reaches theirs —

you feel the fragile architecture of the dream beginning to dissolve, morning light bleeding in at the edges like water through paper, and you're left holding the ghost of that recognition, that relief, carrying it with you as you surface into waking —

wondering if the gathering is still going on somewhere without you.
