**Dream Continuation:**

As the storm rolls in, the air grows heavy with the scent of damp earth and ozone. The trees sway ominously, their leaves rustling like whispered warnings. Thunder cracks in the distance, closer with each breath, and the wind howls through the underbrush, snapping twigs like bones.

Then you see it—a figure standing at the base of an ancient oak, watching you. Their form is indistinct, shifting between human and something else, something older. Their eyes glow faintly in the gathering dark, and though they don’t speak, their presence hums with energy, like the storm itself.

A gust of wind tears through the trees, and the figure raises a hand—not in threat, but in offering. The moment your fingers brush against theirs, the world dissolves into light.

When the storm passes, you wake—still in the forest, but the trees are different now. The path ahead is unclear, but for the first time, you feel as if you’ve been led somewhere purposefully.

And the wind still carries their laughter in its whispers.
