You are the captain of a ship in the middle of a turbulent sea. Your crew looks to you for guidance as the storm worsens, and you grip the wheel with white-knuckled determination, your boots slipping on the rain-slick deck. The sky is a bruised purple, and the wind howls like a living thing, tearing at the sails and snapping the rigging with a sound like bones breaking.  

A crew member shouts over the gale, “Captain, the starboard mast is failing!” You glance back, seeing the timber splinter under the strain, and your mind races. The storm is no ordinary squall—its fury feels *personal*, as though the sea itself is angry at you. Memories flicker: a forgotten promise, a crewmate lost years ago in a similar tempest, the weight of a compass that’s been pointing west for decades, though the maps say there’s nothing there.  

You roar, “Secure the mainsail! Bring the helm hard to port!” The crew obeys, their faces lit by the ghostly glow of lightning. The ship lurches, fighting the waves, and for a moment, you feel the storm’s breath in your teeth, its cold fingers clawing at your resolve. Then, as the ship bucks and twists, you see it—a break in the clouds, a sliver of starlight piercing the darkness.  

But as you steer toward it, the sea below the ship begins to *bubble*, as though something vast and ancient stirs beneath the waves. Your crew falls silent, their fear palpable. You tighten your grip on the wheel, knowing the storm isn’t just a storm. It’s a test. A reckoning.  

And in the heart of the chaos, you hear a voice—not from the crew, but from the storm itself, whispering your name, *inviting* you to follow it deeper.  

What do you do? Do you fight the current, or let it pull you into the unknown?
