...begin to notice something unsettling. The walls of the maze aren't static—they're breathing, almost imperceptibly, expanding and contracting with a rhythm that matches your own heartbeat. The puzzles themselves start to change while you're solving them, the symbols shifting like ink dropped into water, reforming into new patterns just as you think you've grasped their logic.

You pause at a particularly intricate puzzle carved into a stone door: a fractal pattern of interlocking gears and mirrored numbers that seem to count down from infinity. As your fingers trace the solution, you realize the maze isn't testing your ability to think—it's *learning* how you think. Each solved puzzle leaves a faint echo of your thoughts in the air, a ghostly shimmer that gets absorbed into the walls.

The deeper you go, the more the line blurs between you and the maze. You come across a chamber where the puzzle is simply a mirror, but your reflection solves a different puzzle than the one you're working on. When you look down at your hands, the lines on your palms have rearranged themselves into a map—a map that leads further inward, spiraling toward a center that seems to be both a destination and a memory you haven't had yet.

The last puzzle you encounter has no pieces, no symbols, no obvious mechanism. Just a question whispered from somewhere behind your left ear: "If you solve this one, will you still be the person who entered?" The walls lean closer, waiting for your answer, and you realize the maze isn't a place you're in—it's a place you're becoming.
