You start to run, but your legs feel like they are moving through molasses. Every step takes an immense effort, the pavement beneath your feet seeming to stretch and elongate with every stride, pushing the horizon further away.

You reach into your pocket to pull out your phone for the address, but instead of a device, your hand closes around a handful of wet sand. Panic flares in your chest as you let the sand drain from your fingers, watching it turn into moths that flutter away into the purple twilight sky.

Frantic, you grab the shoulder of a passerby—a tall figure wearing a suit made entirely of mirrors. "Where is the meeting?" you shout. "Where is the Spire?"

The figure turns slowly. The mirrors reflect a thousand versions of your own terrified face. They point a gloved finger down a narrow alleyway that wasn't there a moment ago.

You sprint into the alley, but it instantly transforms into a crowded escalator moving downward at high speed. You try to run up the moving stairs, but people holding clock faces instead of briefcases block your path. They shake their heads sadly, the hands on their clocks spinning wildly.

"Time is up," a chorus of voices whispers, though you know you still have ten minutes.

You burst through a glass door at the top of the escalator and suddenly find yourself standing in the middle of a vast, silent ocean. The water is as hard as glass, and you are wearing nothing but your shoes. In the distance, a massive skyscraper rises from the water, but it's upside down, its spire piercing the deep ocean floor.

You realize the meeting is happening at the very tip of that spire, deep underwater. You take a deep breath to dive, but just as you break the surface, you wake up.
