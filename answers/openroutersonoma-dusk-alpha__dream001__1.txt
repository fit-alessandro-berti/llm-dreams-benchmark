You find yourself in a vast, unfamiliar city, and you realize you have an important meeting in an hour but no idea where it is. You start to wander the labyrinthine streets, neon lights flickering like fireflies in the perpetual twilight, the air humming with the chatter of languages you half-understand. Panic bubbles up, but then you spot a glowing map kiosk on a corner, its holographic display pulsing invitingly. As you approach, it scans your face and whispers, "The meeting is at the Crystal Spire, 47th level—follow the silver threads." You glance down, and sure enough, ethereal silver lines weave across the pavement, leading you through bustling markets and up spiraling escalators that defy gravity. But as you ascend, the threads multiply, branching into infinite paths, and the city begins to fold in on itself like origami. You reach the Spire just in time, only to find the meeting room empty, save for a single chair facing a mirror that reflects not you, but a version of yourself who's already left. The dream shimmers, and you wake with the echo of unfinished business lingering in the air.
