step outside into the cool night air to clear your heads. The streetlights flicker above, casting long shadows that seem to stretch and twist like they’re listening. You both walk in silence for a few blocks, the tension still humming, but softer now. Then your friend stops, turns to you, and says, “What if we’re both right, just… in different worlds?”

You laugh, not because it’s funny, but because it feels true—like the kind of clarity that only comes when you're raw and honest. The sky above shifts, stars rearranging into constellations you’ve never seen but somehow recognize. A distant bell rings, though there’s no clock tower in sight.

You wonder aloud: "Have we always been having this conversation? Or is this the first time it’s finally landing?"

What do you think they’d say?
