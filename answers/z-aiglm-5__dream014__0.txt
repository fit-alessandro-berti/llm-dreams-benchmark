...hesitantly take their outstretched hands. The moment your fingers touch theirs, the cold, grey concrete of the sidewalk softens into warm, mossy earth, and the blaring horns of traffic dissolve into the gentle sound of wind chimes.

As they guide you forward, the towering, oppressive buildings begin to bend and twist, blooming into giant, ancient trees that filter the sunlight into a soft, golden haze. You try to ask where you are going, but your voice feels distant, unnecessary. They simply smile, their eyes crinkling with a kindness that feels ancient and familiar.

They lead you not to a street or a landmark, but to a clearing that smells of rain and vanilla. In the center stands a doorframe without walls, standing alone against the sky. The strangers gesture toward it, and as you step through, the heavy feeling of loneliness evaporates, replaced by a sense of weightless belonging. You turn back to thank them, but they have dissolved into a flock of colorful birds, taking flight into a violet sky, leaving you with the profound realization that you were never truly lost, only temporarily forgetful of the way home.
