**...and you realize the project file is not a document, but a single, smooth, obsidian marble resting on your keyboard.**

Your boss, Mr. Henderson—whose face is strangely blurry, like a poorly rendered video game character—doesn’t seem to notice the marble. He simply taps his wristwatch, which clicks far too loudly in the otherwise silent office.

“Well? Get started, Johnson. Deliverable in two hours. You know what needs to be done.”

You pick up the marble. It’s ice cold and slightly wet. You instinctively try to input data into it, pressing it against the blank monitor screen. Nothing happens, but the monitor screen suddenly reflects your face in microscopic detail—every pore, every flicker of anxiety—and you hear a chorus of tiny, distressed whispers coming from the reflection.

The stress is too much. You look back at your desk, and everything has begun to dissolve slightly. Your stapler is melting into a puddle of viscous silver. Your ergonomic chair is growing moss. The air smells sharply of ozone and old paperclips.

You need to work on the marble. You try to communicate with it.

“What is the scope?” you whisper to the glossy black sphere.

In response, the marble doesn’t speak, but it vibrates rapidly. The vibration transfers into your hand, and you suddenly *know* the project: **It is the distillation of all ambient noise in the building into a single, perfectly balanced chord.**

You look up at Mr. Henderson. He is now standing on your desk, balancing precariously on the stack of tax forms you’ve been ignoring for weeks. His voice is calm, yet amplified, sounding like it’s coming from a distant PA system.

“Time is running out, Johnson. We need that chord. The shareholders are waiting for the perfect resonance.”

Panic gives way to a strange, dreamlike clarity. You realize the office isn't just quiet—it's empty. Where were the other employees? You turn to the cubicle farm, but the walls have receded, replaced by an endless, swirling ocean of filing cabinets stretching toward a horizon lit by an impossible green moon.

You clutch the marble. If the project is noise distillation, you need silence first. You close your eyes and focus on the terrible, echoing silence of the office.

When you open your eyes, the marble has grown slightly warm. It has also begun to **float, dragging your hand upward.** Your body feels lighter and lighter. Mr. Henderson is yelling, but his words are distorted, reversing, sounding like "sdrawkcab gniklat."

You don't start the impossible project. You accept the physics of the dream.

You let go of the desk, and the marble pulls you up gently toward the fluorescent lights, which are buzzing in that perfect, low-C frequency you were supposed to be trying to filter out.

As you drift toward the ceiling, you look down at Mr. Henderson, who is now the size of a doll, his frantic gestures growing slower. You pass through the ceiling tile as if it were vapor, and find yourself in a vast, empty space—the attic of the building—where all the dust motes are actually tiny, glittering ideas that were never acted upon.

The marble pulses one last time, humming, and you understand the real deadline: **The deadline was not about completing the task, but about the exact moment you decided to stop trying to complete the task.**

You float there, suspended above the empty office, resting perfectly in the silent attic, the impossible deadline ticking away somewhere far below, now meaningless. The marble turns soft and warm in your hand, smelling exactly like cinnamon and acceptance.

And then, finally, you sleep.
