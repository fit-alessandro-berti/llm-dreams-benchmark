As you navigate the ever-shifting tapestry of colors and forms, the blank canvas absorbs the light, its edges dissolving into the shifting hues. You begin to *fill* it with the soft, rhythmic patterns of your thoughts — a symphony of gradients and illusions. Each stroke whispers secrets you cannot silence, while the world itself becomes a living entity, humming with the quiet pulse of dreams. And in that moment, you realize: sometimes, the blank canvas is not empty, but a mirror reflecting the endless possibilities of your own being.
