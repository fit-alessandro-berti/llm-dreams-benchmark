...realize it is the only still point in a universe of frantic motion. You instinctively reach out to touch the rough texture of the fabric. The moment your fingertips graze the surface, the swirling chaos of the landscape rushes in. 

You don't need a brush. The canvas begins to inhale the world around you. The screaming neon clouds are sucked downward, turning into soft, deliberate strokes of oil paint as they cross the frame. The melting geometric shapes in the distance are pulled closer, sharpening into a charcoal horizon line. You watch in awe as the nightmare of constant change is captured, tamed, and ordered on the flat surface. The vibrant colors drain from the air, leaving you standing in a silent, monochrome void, holding a painting of a world that feels more real than the dream itself.
