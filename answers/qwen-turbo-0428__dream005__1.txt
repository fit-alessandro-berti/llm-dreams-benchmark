You are at a large social gathering where you only know one person. As you try to find them, you encounter various groups of people and each one seems to pull you in with their own strange, vivid stories. One group is dressed in mismatched formal wear, speaking in riddles about time travel. Another is a circle of children who insist they're adults, playing a game with invisible cards that make the air shimmer. 

You keep moving, weaving through the crowd, but every time you think you're close to the person you know, something happens — a sudden gust of wind carries away your thoughts, a mirror reflects a version of yourself you don’t recognize, or a door appears where there was none before, leading to a hallway filled with floating books.

As you finally spot the person you’re looking for, they turn to you and say, “You’re late,” but their voice sounds like it’s coming from somewhere far away. You reach out, but the moment your fingers touch theirs, the dream shifts again — and you’re standing in a field under a sky that’s made of stars and smoke, with no memory of how you got there.

And then, just as you begin to understand, you wake up.
