and you feel your pulse sync with the rhythm of their footsteps. Their voices are not ordinary words but a choir of soft bells that seem to come from everywhere and nowhere at once, guiding you through a maze of cobblestones that ripple like water. The city, once vast and indifferent, suddenly tightens its embrace, folding the alleys into a living map that knows your name.

You step into a side street that no longer smells of exhaust and street vendors but of jasmine and old stone. The air tastes like memory, sweet and fleeting. The strangers’ faces blur into one another, forming a mosaic of features that you recognize from childhood dreams: the mother’s gentle smile, the old man on the bench who always wore a red scarf, the girl who used to paint rainbows on the walls of the abandoned theater. They are fragments of your past, assembled into a crew that refuses to let you wander into the abyss.

As you follow them, the city’s skyline melts, and the skyscrapers stretch into translucent ribbons, each one a different color that sways in a wind that hums in the language of lullabies. The streetlights flicker, transforming into lanterns of fireflies that drift upward, leaving trails of silver mist. You realize that each lantern carries a piece of someone’s lost hope, and the strangers gather them in their hands, forming a lantern-lit path that glows like moonlight on water.

The group stops at a plaza that you never knew existed. A fountain sits at its center, not spouting water, but a pool of liquid crystal that reflects scenes of you at different ages—a childhood home, a first kiss, a heartbreak that turned into a sunrise, a quiet moment of triumph under a stormy sky. You touch the crystal, and a rush of all those moments cascades into your mind, a torrent of emotions that washes the ache of being lost away. The strangers whisper, “It’s okay to be lost. The map you need is the one you draw inside.”

Their guide is not a path but an invitation—to step into your own story, to see your solitude as a pause, not a void. They lead you further, toward the edge of the city, where the pavement dissolves into a soft moss that feels like the underside of a leaf, and a doorway appears. Behind it is a tunnel of books, rows upon rows of stories, all humming in soft, unison tones. The air smells of ink and adventure. The strangers hand you a book that feels warm against your palm. Its pages are blank, but you can feel the pulse of potential, the possibility of writing your own ending.

“Close your eyes,” one of them says, their voice an old oak’s whisper. “Feel the world as it should be: not the city’s chaos, but the heart of your dream.”

You do. Your mind drifts to a place where the sky is a canvas and the clouds are strokes of paint, your footsteps echoing in the silence. The dream dissolves into the city’s streets again, but this time you walk in a circle, the streets forming a perfect ring. You see the city from a rooftop that seems to float above the ground, the lights below swirling like constellations. The strangers, now silhouettes against the sky, smile. They have been the guide, the lanterns, the book—they are the parts of you you had forgotten, now brought back to light.

You reach a small, unassuming door at the end of the ring. Inside, a room with a single window overlooking the whole city, yet no city outside—just a horizon that shifts between sunrise, midday, sunset, and dawn all at once. The air is still, and your breath echoes in a perfect rhythm.

You pull on the knob, feel it turn, and the door swings open. The space beyond is a garden of impossible colors, a place where you can plant any seed: a hope, a dream, a new path. The dream, in all its surreal, swirling beauty, is complete. It’s not a conclusion but an invitation—to step out of the city, into the garden you’ve cultivated inside yourself. As you step through, the city’s bustle fades, replaced by the soft hum of your own heartbeat, echoing in sync with the world you’ve created.

And when you finally wake, you will hold onto the lantern-lit path, the book of blank pages, and the knowledge that you can always find your way if you remember that even in a bustling city, kind strangers can appear, and inside them, parts of your own story wait to be discovered.
